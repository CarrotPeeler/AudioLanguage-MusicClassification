Two halves of the whole
We cannot stand each other
Yet we're playing the same role
Is there no medicine to get rid of you?
Isn't there a single cure
For the things we do?
We've always been a lot like
An apartheid regime of two
Everything is black or white
And one is always blue
Is there no medicine to get rid of you?
Isn't there a single cure
For the things we do?You might also likeEmbed
