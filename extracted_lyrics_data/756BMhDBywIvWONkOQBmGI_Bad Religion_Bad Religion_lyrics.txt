See my body, it's nothing to get hung about
I'm nobody except genetic runaround
Spiritual era's gone, it ain't coming back
Bad Religion, a copout, that is all that's left

Hey Mr. Mime, stop wasting my time
With your factory precision
Factory precision is your

Bad Religion, regurgitate
Indecision, it's not too late
Bad Religion, Bad Religion
Fight!

Don't you know the place we're in's a piece of shit?
Don't you know blind faith through lies won't conquer it?
Don't you know responsibility is yours?
I don't care a thing about eternal fires

Listen this time, it's more than a rhyme
It's your indecision
Your indecision is your
You might also like
Bad Religion, regurgitate
Indecision, it's not too late
Bad Religion, regurgitate
Indecision, it's not too late
Bad Religion, Bad Religion
