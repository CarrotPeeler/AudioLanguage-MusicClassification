2 ContributorsBack to Get Ya LyricsThink I found something that's gonna wreck my mind
Keep it close to me, baby, get it all the time
Looked so good when I first met ya
I told ya, babe, I'd be back to get ya
Ooh yeah
Yeah
Ain't gonna waste any time with you
Hot and ready, gonna come on through
Ain't gonna hang around your door
Gonna pound it down, I gotta get some more
Rip them wires right off your phone
Got to make sure we're all alone
Roll me over till I turn blue
Rockin' and rollin' till way past two
Looked so good when I first met ya
I told you then I'd be back to get ya
You looked so good when I first met ya, uh, come on
Told you then I'd be back to get ya
Get it, mama
Scramble my eggs, honey, come on
It's comin', honey, there it is
Wow, yeah
Oh

You know I'll take you any ol' place
Take it easy, got all the time
Gotta buzz on me, baby, and I'm feelin' fine
Don't get shy or play polite, ha ha
Just shut your mouth and turn off the light
Been alone and I been blue
C'mon, baby, I wanna rock with you
Makin' a mess all over the floor
Keep it going till I get sore
You looked so good when I first met ya
Told you then I'd be back to get ya, here I am, honey
You looked so good when I first met ya
I told you then I'd be back to get ya
Get it, mamaEmbed
