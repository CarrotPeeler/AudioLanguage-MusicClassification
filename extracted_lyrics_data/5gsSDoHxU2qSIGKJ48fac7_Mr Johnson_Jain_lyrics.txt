Oh, Mr. Johnson must get out
Mr. Johnson must be free
Mr. Johnson must get wild
Before the night
Oh, Mr. Johnson must get out
Mr. Johnson must be free
Mr. Johnson must get wild
Before the night

Every day he dreams to walk
Away from these office doors
Every day he dreams for more
He dreams for a change to come
It's hard to find a way
In the middle of the crowd
It's always hard to say
If our doubts are wrong or right

Oh, Mr. Johnson must get out
Mr. Johnson must be free
Mr. Johnson must get wild
Before the night
Oh, Mr. Johnson must get out
Mr. Johnson must be free
Mr. Johnson must get wild
Before the night
You might also like
Every day he feels the same
Feels the same old little pain
When he looks up in the sky
When his dreams are flying far
That's how he realizes
He has to make a change
He won't let any man now
Cross his rise to life

Oh, Mr. Johnson must get out
Mr. Johnson must be free
Mr. Johnson must get wild
Before the night
Oh, Mr. Johnson must get out
Mr. Johnson must be free
Mr. Johnson must get wild
Before the night

He runs to get out, he rushes to get out
He wanna feel the sun warming his mind
He'd better watch out, not gonna burn out
Finding his way, flying away
He runs to get out, he rushes to get out
He wanna feel the sun warming his mind
He'd better watch out, not gonna burn out
Finding his way, flying away
Oh, Mr. Johnson must get out
Mr. Johnson must be free
Mr. Johnson must get wild
Before the night
Oh, Mr. Johnson must get out
Mr. Johnson must be free
Mr. Johnson must get wild
Before the night
Oh, Mr. Johnson must get out
Mr. Johnson must be free
Mr. Johnson must get wild
Before the night
Oh, Mr. Johnson must get out
Mr. Johnson must be free
Mr. Johnson must get wild
Before the night3Embed
