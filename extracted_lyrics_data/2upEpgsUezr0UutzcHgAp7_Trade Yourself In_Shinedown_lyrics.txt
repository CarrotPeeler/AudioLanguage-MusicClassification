7 ContributorsTrade Yourself In Lyrics
Deal with me
Don’t even think about leaving yet
I’m not a part of some false regret
Even though I believe in fables
Come reset
A part of life that you’d soon forget
And maybe think about who you hurt
In the process

I don't think they know
That's my heart exposed
From the fearing of the endless lies

Trade yourself in for the perfect one
No one needs to know, that you feel you’ve been ruined
Trade yourself in for diamond eyes
Watch the stars collide, as you’re lifted from your burden

You see me
And you know I am not the same
Can’t pretend just to fake a smile
'Cause you know I feel every ounce of
Pain combined
With the loss of a youthful mind
You need to look at what you’ve become
And try to figure out where you came from

I don't think they know
That's my heart exposed
From the fearing of the endless lies

Trade yourself in for the perfect one
No one needs to know, that you feel you've been ruined
Trade yourself in for diamond eyes
Watch the stars collide, as you're lifted from your burden

I know you can't feel a thing
(I don't think they know that's my heart exposed)
It hurts to feel anymore

Trade yourself in for the perfect one
No one needs to know, that you feel you've been ruined
Trade yourself in for diamond eyes
Watch the stars collide, as you're lifted from your burden

Trade yourself in for the perfect one
No one needs to know, that you feel you've been ruined
Trade yourself in for diamond eyes
Watch the stars collide, as you're lifted from your burdenEmbed
