11 ContributorsDead Set on Suicide LyricsIrrational, illogical and preposterously ludicrous
Denatured, deprogrammed to blindly
Go against what we are
Human ideas turned concrete, material
Our funeral drape now hewn from
The fabrics of imagination
Turning the other cheek, this never worked within the wild
You'd be a meal in seconds, cycle of life, natural law
Now see this Jesus Christ, a thorn in the side of right
No fight or flight? Anything else is simply suicidal
No love for enemies, I see their eyes
Waiting there in the shadows
Extended hands will only be severed
You've condemned yourself to the gallows
Jesus Christ is suicide
Sighting the blind, sheltering the poor
Blood into wine, but all is fair in blood and gore
Sensational, unanimous, we need a hero
Unguided, this chaos that makes humans what they are
How neutered, how secure, new drones to shovel the manure
Keep the masses sedated, validating their
Tendencies for hatred

Jesus Christ is suicide
Jesus Christ is suicide
Alas, so sweet are the sentiments
Aghast I stand in your ignorance, unclean
He must hate every one of us
He would enslave every one of us forever
No love for enemies, I see their eyes
Waiting there in the night
Extended hands will only be severed
Now you realize Christ is deathEmbed
