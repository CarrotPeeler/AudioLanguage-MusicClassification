5 ContributorsBlack Horizons LyricsFrom my Tower I behold the landscape below
I see the river of blood in fury flow
I stare into the night, yet my visions clear
From the distant villages every word I hear
I am the almighty, the one with wisdom wide
I am the great shadow and from daylight in my tower i hide
I have seen the abyss and all that lies within
I am the great shadow and I was born in sin
Thy shadow swept by like an angel fading to grey
Thy eyes were like weakening candles leaving the flames to die
Thy pale cold face, once so full of life
Now its torn as of thorns of ice
Thy towers fell to the ground
I am the almighty, the one with wisdom wide
I am the great shadow and from daylight in my tower i hide
I have seen the abyss and all that lies within
I am the great shadow and I was born in sin

Waaah!
Yes this is the land, the land of the black horizon
Where the shores are covered with the bodies
Of thy followers
Triumphal vengeance, Dethroning the shape of thou
Fade I say, wither away
You might also likeI am the almighty, the one with wisdom wide
I am the great shadow, no daylight over my kingdom ride
At the black horizons, my eyes and souls the wind
I am the great shadow and I was born in sin
I am the almighty, the one with wisdom wide
I am the great shadow, no daylight over my kingdom ride
At the black horizons, my eyes and souls the wind
Behold the land of sinEmbed
