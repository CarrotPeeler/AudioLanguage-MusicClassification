I got a gal here, in this town, the best-lookin' brown around
I got a gal, in this town, the best-lookin' brown around
She's a strictly tailor-made, she ain't no hand-me-down
Catch you trucking' with her, I'm gonna sure shoot you down
Keep on truckin', mama, truckin' my blues away
Truckin' my blues away

Keep on truckin', mama, truckin' my blues away
Keep on truckin' mama, 'til you truck my blues away
I got a gal, she's little and neat
Shen she start to truckin', man it's so sweet
Keep on truckin', mama, truckin' my blues away
Truckin' my blues away

Keep on truckin', baby, truckin' my blues away (Yes!)
Keep on truckin', baby, truckin' my blues away
I know a gal, she's long and tall, when she start to truckin' make a little man squall
Keep on truckin', mama, truckin' my blues away
I mean, truckin' my blues away
Yeah!

Keep on truckin', baby, truckin' my bluеs away
Keep on truckin', mama, truckin' my blues away
She does thе dance you call beedle-um-bum, sure miss something if you don't truck some
Keep on truckin', mama, truckin' my blues away
Truckin' my blues away

Keep on truckin', baby, truckin' my blues away
Keep on truckin', mama, truckin' my blues away (Yea!)
You don't have to hurry, you don't have to go, wait a little while you might want to truck some more
Keep on truckin', baby, truckin' my blues away, truckin' my blues away

Keep on truckin', mama, truckin' my blues away (Yeah!)
Keep on truckin', baby, truckin' my blues away
Make a lame man run, make a blind man see, sure gets good when she truckin' with me
Keep on truckin', baby, truck my blues away...Embed
