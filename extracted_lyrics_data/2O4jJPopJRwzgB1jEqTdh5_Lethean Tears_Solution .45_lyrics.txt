5 ContributorsLethean Tears Lyrics
As time goes by
All eventually comes full circle
Just turning end for end
Where benightedness tip the scales
And once the fire has been lit
The mind's eye closes anew
Through endless ages
Ever lapsing into old ways

A denied tomorrow
Calling on yesterday
Headway in reverse
Only shadows reach the light of day

Another sun now sets within
On the torn apart
Not to be found again therein
Bleeding dry the heart
Once more a dawn now wearing thin
Broken work of art
A can of worms
Incisive burns of the dark
You might also like
Whatever comes now
Nothing but a reflection bygone
Restored continuum
And the tide is on the turn

A denied tomorrow
Calling on yesterday
Headway in reverse
Only shadows reach
The light of day

Another sun now sets within
On the torn apart
Not to be found again therein
Bleeding dry the heart
Once more a dawn now wearing thin
Broken work of art
A can of worms
Incisive burns of the dark

Ruins laid in without cause
Source-less call for silence
Self-supporting fear
Unaware abidance
Firm like ropes of sand
Past that go for nothing
Come lethean tears
Another sun now sets within
On the torn apart
Not to be found again therein
Bleeding dry the heart
Once more a dawn now wearing thin
Broken work of art
A can of worm
Incisive burns of the dark
Another sun now sets within
On the torn apart
Not to be found again therein
Bleeding dry the heart
Once more a dawn now wearing thin
Broken work of art
A can of worm
Incisive burns of the darkEmbed
