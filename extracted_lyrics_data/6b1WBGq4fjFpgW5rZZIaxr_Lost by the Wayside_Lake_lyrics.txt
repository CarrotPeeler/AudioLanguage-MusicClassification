3 ContributorsLost by the Wayside LyricsI was heading down the road kinda late last night
Headin’ home to hit the sack
When a man standing there right before my eyes
Had a cross upon way behind
Well my eyes they just started rolling
They were rolling at this sight
I pushed the freak aside running for my life
Yeah I left him way behind
Oh well the Lord said come forth
But I came fifth
And I was lost by the wayside
And my dreams said don’t go
But then I did
And I was caught in a landslide
Caught in a landslide
By the wayside
I was laying in my bed with some ladyfriend
When I thought I heard a noise
Well she said man when in doubt you’d
Better check it out
So I really had no choice
Well I don’t mind to say it was scary
I was shaken by this sight
Hanging from my bed by a silver thread
I looked myself right right in the eye
You might also likeOh well the Lord said come forth
But I came fifth
And I was lost by the wayside
And my dreams said don’t go
But then I did
And I was caught in a landslide
Caught in a landslide
By the waysideEmbed
