4 ContributorsReally Might Be Gone Lyrics
(Maybe I'll get through it)
Not much to lean on, I'll get through it
You know I do it to myself anyway
She's got my calls blocked and she's through with it
You know I do it to myself anyway

You know I think it might be time
To give myself a rise and shine
And I'll be happy and my couch is gonna miss me
And all the girls will wanna kiss me

Gotta get my shit together
'Cause this is dragging on and on
And I can't wait around forever
I'm starting to think she really might be gone

(Oh, maybe I'll get through it)
She's got a boyfriend, I'm looking through it
And I can't do it to myself anyway
And I won't slam her 'cause I blew it
You know I do it to myself anyway
See Bowling for Soup LiveGet tickets as low as $80You might also like
And maybe she doesn't have the time
To deal with issues such as mine
And she'll be happy but I swear she's gonna miss me
Because all the girls will wanna kiss me

Gotta get my shit together
'Cause this is dragging on and on
And I can't wait around forever
I'm starting to think she really might be gone

And I didn't want us to stay
I don't know what else to say, yeah
And I, I'm better off this way
I'm better off this way without you anyway

Gotta get my shit together
'Cause this is dragging on and on
And I can't wait around forever
I'm starting to think she really might be gone

Gotta get my shit together
(Gotta get my shit together)
I've gotta get my shit together
(I can't wait around forever)
Gotta get my shit together
(She really might be gone)
Yeah!
Oh!
Come on!
(Yeah that is BS)Embed
