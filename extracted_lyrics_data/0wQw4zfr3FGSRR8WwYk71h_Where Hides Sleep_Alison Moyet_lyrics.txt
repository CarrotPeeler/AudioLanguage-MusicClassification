5 ContributorsWhere Hides Sleep LyricsWhere hides sleep is she watching me
Don't desert me now
Where hides sleep you're tormenting me
Don't forsake me now
Take hold of my soul and pull me into darkness
Cover me over and stifle my anguish
Where hides sleep she's avoiding me
Don't evade me now
Where hides sleep please don't torture me
Don't forsake me now
I open my lips to your warm ancient potion
I would be still and devoid of emotion
For I would be slumber that I could be rest
Curl in warm embers of such peacefulness
Caressed by oblivion and swallowed by dreams
I want you to hold me and cover my eyes
From the cold distant daylight
Holds no surprise
You could make me forget, you could make me believe
If you'd steal away on us by enemy, by enemy
Where hides sleep is she watching me
Don't desert me now
Where hides sleep you're tormenting me
Don't forsake me now
