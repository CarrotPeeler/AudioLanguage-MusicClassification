5 ContributorsWherever Would I Be? LyricsWhen my world is turning
When it's turning upside down
When all I see is rain
When I think the night won't end
I just think of you
And I can see the sun again
Wherever would I be without you?
If I didn't have you, if I didn't have you
Whatever would I do now, baby?
Wherever would I be without you?
I'd be nowhere, nowhere, I'd be nowhere, nowhere
When the dreams I dream all seem a million miles away
When I'm sure I'll never win
When it's looking like I've lost my faith
I just look at you baby, baby
And I got a reason to believe again, oh, oh
Wherever would I be without you?
If I didn't have you, ooh
Whatever would I do now, baby?
Wherever would I be without you?
I'd be nowhere, I'd be nowhere, I'd be nowhere
Without you to love me
Just be wasting time
Going out of my mind

If I didn't have you, if I didn't have you
Whatever would I do now baby?
Wherever would I be?
I'd be nowhere, nowhere, I'd be nowhere, nowhere, oh, oh
Wherever would I be? Wherever would I be?
If I didn't have you, if I didn't, if I didn't, if I didn't have you, ah, ah
I'd be nowhere, I'd be nowhere
Without you, oh, ohEmbed
