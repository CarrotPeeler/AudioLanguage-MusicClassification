3 ContributorsFingers Crossed Lyrics
I always knew you were a keeper
Maybe not exactly from day one
Definitely wanted to be overdone
And even though you are a sleeper
Well, to me that's never been a crime
And afterall, well you, yeah, you woke up in time

So now you're back on your feet again
Now you're back to compete with men
Now you're back and it took some time
To get from misery to prime
Now you're back here to change the world
Now you're back and I say "Go girl"
Now you're back and you'll do just fine
'Cause after rainy days the sun will shine

I know I've been part of the reasons
Why you sometimes felt the sore
And I'm sorry I didn't give you more
But now you're having better seasons
And your mom, she's watching you
From above with fingers crossed for everything you do

So now you're back on your feet again
Now you're back to compete with men
Now you're back and it took some time
To get from misery to prime
Now you're back here to change the world
Now you're back and I say "Go girl"
Now you're back and you'll do just fine, so don't resign
'Cause after rainy days the sun will shine

It doesn't matter what others say
Even those you call friends
Don't leave it out for another day
This might be your big chance

And you're the one always beside me
When I'm lost you're always to guide me
It's about time that I gave you something back, something back
And I'm the one selfish and greedy
Never cared enough of what you needed
But even still you had the strength to get back in the end

So now you're back on your feet again
Now you're back to compete with men
Now you're back and it took some time
To get from misery to prime
Now you're back here to change the world
Now you're back and I say: "Go girl"
Now you're back and you'll do just fine
So don't resign
'cause after rainy days the sun will shine
On you
I know the sun will shine
For you
I know you'll do just fine
Yeah you
I know the sun will shine
On you, yeah...Embed
