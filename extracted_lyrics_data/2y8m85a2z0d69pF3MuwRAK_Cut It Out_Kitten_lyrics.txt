Book camp ties and we're not so free
Always thought you could be more like me
More like me
23 years and you're out of town
Money on fire and you're making me proud
Proud
Sleeping all day with the radio on
Local jokes but not for long
Not for long

You give me life still, let me breathe
Keep my face on, you're all I need
Leave the lights on, you're all I see
Getting wasted, you're all I need
Oh, oh, oh

Followed cars and following you
Living large, hit 'em, we're through
Hit 'em, we're through
I fought JP, I felt so weak
Bent up in the corner, it's not for free
Not for free
Yeah
You might also like
You give me life still, you let me breathe
Keep my face on, you're all I need
Leave the lights on, you're all I see
Getting wasted, you're all I need
Oh

Just let me breathe
Just let me breathe
Just let me breathe
Just let me breathe
Just let me breathe
Just let me breathe
Just let me breathe

You give me still, let me breathe
You keep my face on, you're all I need
Leave the lights on, you're all I see
Bent and wasted, you're all I need
Oh

You're all I need
You're all I need3Embed
