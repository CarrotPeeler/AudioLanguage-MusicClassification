2 ContributorsThe Closest Ghost LyricsI feel surround by the dark
My scares seems like some pretty mark
When past is morphing to ask
Answer's never happen, answer's never happen
You thing that Doubt is like this power
Looking for the other better
To really feelin' each fuckin hour
How can we start whith nothing
We're on the point of no late ending
Day flies but we so high in difference
To end this day as we started
Ride into your mood as you playin' with your doubt
May seems like a shower when you smoke those funny ashes
Asking to yourself how doin' the closest ghost
Where is that better place that make you call and finally go
To the fine and see the bright
Complain your skills to silly illy light
Used to be player, doin' different task
Your heart is forest, breathing with the chest
How can we start with nothing
We're on the point of no late ending
Day flies but we so high in difference
To end this day as we started
Here it comes my breakdown, it comes my breakdownYou might also likeEmbed
