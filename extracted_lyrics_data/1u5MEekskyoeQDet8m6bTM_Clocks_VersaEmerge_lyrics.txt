1 ContributorClocks Lyrics
Since that clock's first tick
A dark hue and fear driven
It's only real 'til it ends

As the stars fall on our head
Call the wind the thief for stealing their prayers

Look at us shake the sky
Pulling the whites from my eyes
And as the hands are spinning, they're waving you goodbye
Test for more is what we're striving for
As we sleep we walk

(Can't awake)
Can't awake the ones who live this life
(Not on our own)
'Cause people are the same
(We are the same)
Only habits change
But your starry eyes
No, they don't tell me a thing
Staring over heavy heads
You might also like
Look at us shake the sky
Pulling the whites from my eyes
And as the hands are spinning, they're waving you goodbye
A test for more is what we're striving for
As we sleep, we walk

I swear, I felt you crawling under my skin
I swear, oh, I swear
Towers won't fit our view
Forget the man in the mountains follows you
He follows you
(But your starry eyes, no, they don't mean a thing)

As we sleep, we walk
As we sleep, we walk
As we sleep, we walk (And I swear, I swear I felt you)
As we sleep, we walkEmbed
