21 ContributorsHard to See Lyrics
I'm growing so distant
Nothing makes sense to me anymore
I'm learning to resist
Becoming more than you ever were

Can't explain what's come over me
(Come over me)
Can't explain why it's so hard for me
So hard to see your side

Projecting all my anger
I can't seem to get this through to you
The walls are closing in
I dare you to walk in my shoes

Can't explain what's come over me
(Come over me)
Can't explain why it's so hard for me
So hard to see your side

Your side
I won't see your side

Can't explain what's come over me
(Come over me)
Can't explain why it's so hard for me
So hard to see your
Can't explain what's come over me
(Come over me)
Can't explain why it's so hard for me
So hard to see your side

I won't see your
Your side1Embed
