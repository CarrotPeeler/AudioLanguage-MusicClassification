1 ContributorEyeballinâ€™ LyricsYou know why?
It sounds real good
Quit my cause baby
Quit our fallin'
Who the hell works?
Look in, open up yourself
Poke your head around
Get down, baby
Telephone rings
Who's that callin' on the line?
Pick it up one more time
That's trouble comin' out the back door
He be lookin' out the front
Right in the back
I'm fallin' quick
Quit it
Quit our fallin'
Put that away
They call me Gorilla
Human guitar maker
You call me Mr. Rhythm
Human I am
??
A pack of lies
Said I'm in trouble, baby

Love me to deathEmbed
