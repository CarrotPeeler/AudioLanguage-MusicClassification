50 ContributorsTalkinâ€™ da Hardest Lyrics
If you're talkin' the hardest
Giggs better pop up in your thoughts as an artist (Jheeze)
Taunting the market
Everybody wants to know where Walk in da Park is (Hah)
Walk in the party, sporting Armani
Half of the crowd's all snorting my Charlie
Sorted the bar, time to sort the punani
Chicks looking at me like "Talk to me darling" (Jheeze)
Hollering at man
Winking, smiling and wanna attack man
I think these lighties loving my Black Gang
Everyone's suit same colour as Batman's (Ooh)
Flipping like a quarter a brick (Yeah)
Bag 28 with a thought of a jib (Yeah)
Anybody thinks they can talk to my clique
Will end up covered in red like a portion of chips (Umm)
Pour me a drink
Big fur jacket, that's the thoughts of a pimp (Yeah)
I used to be quiet, did that sort anything?
So I had to run riot when I bought me a ting
Walk with my ting, peddling morphine
Dem times dere, I was licking out more green
Skip couple years, '07 the story
Now I'm Hollowman in some heavy Dior jeans (Umm)
Bitch niggas lookin' for glory (Yeah)
Wanna beef me so they can tell you a story (Yeah)
It'll get bloody and it'll get gory
Clapped in the neck like Amanda in Saw 3 (Jheez)
Yeah I got my suttin' deh pon me (Yeah)
So much straps I'll have a weaponry orgy (Ooh)
Feds try nick me for a murder
But it could've been the man that had the weapon before me
B, white, green, I been peddling all three
Dropped P a box, it was just under 4G (Jheeze)
I told her weigh the 10s at 2 grams (Hmm)
And weigh the 8ths about 4g
Badman's on the block (Yeah)
Spender, Young Giggs, Mantis and Rockz (Rockz)
TB, Tinie, Carlton and Jim Jones
Holding it down while they handle the clock (My niggas)
Pussyholes got my mandem on lock (Lock)
Straps, we handle a lot
Clapped your mandem and what?
Me and you are cool but you can stand there and watch
My PYGs will put their hands on your watch (Yeah)
Be easy, I'll put your mans in a box (Yeah)
Young Lap, TB, JJ and Shockz
I treat my little niggas like fam, not a boss (Umm)
All my mandem are hot (Yeah, yeah)
But your mandem are washed (Haha)
Beat couple shots and you ran to the cops
Big .45, they couldn't handle the shock (Haha)
I talk about that handgun a lot (Why?)
But that one, Hollowman handles a lot (Yeah, jheez)
All the Black Gang fam are handled a lot (Lot, yeah)
Me and Foss bagging up grams at the spot (Yeah)
Shots in my grind gear, jumped in my vehicle
All gassed up, now I'mma slang me a rock (Umm)
Hollowman handles his job
Feds on the ground, helicopters on top
Beautiful women wanna dock to my cot (Jheez)
A beautiful woman wouldn't stop getting cock
Ahh shitYou might also like9Embed
