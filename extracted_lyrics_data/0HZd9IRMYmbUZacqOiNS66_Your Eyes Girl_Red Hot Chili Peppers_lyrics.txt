8 ContributorsYour Eyes Girl Lyrics
"Ah, fuck...shit!"

I’m afraid that I’m never afraid
I’ve got combat boots and I’m American made
For your eyes girl

Mormon lover on a delicate day
Going to marry the boss, gettin' carried away
War cries girl

I’m not immune to Canadian snow
Now teach me everything that I should know
With your eyes girl

Freeze on the radio
I’ve got to leave and alone
Freeze on the radio
I’ve got to bleed into snow

Hold on
Let go
We know
You might also like
Do you shine like a temple inside
Can I open your core, so gentle and wide
Like your eyes girl

Rack ‘em up, stretch ‘em out when they’re tight
This acetylene torch is giving me sight
War cries girl
Hey!

Freeze on the radio
I’ve got to leave and alone
Freeze on the radio
I’ve got to bleed into snow

Hold on
Let go
We know

Kill it!
WOOOOOO!
Lord, woo!
Yeah!
Uh, uh, uh!
Your! Eyes! Girl! Oh!
Black and blue from the hullabaloo
Do the caribou bite when they look into you
And your eyes girl

Freeze on the radio
I’ve got to leave and alone
Freeze on the radio
I’ve got to bleed into snow

Hold on
Let go
We knowEmbed
