1 ContributorChatma LyricsSend out the rallying cry, my sisters
All over the village
Under my skin is the fire
Of rage and anger
Shouted out at the gathering of my brothers
Suffering for far too long
And in my misery
Loud and clear
At the exit of the village
If the radio in london was closer
My sisters would let everyone know
That the fire has been burning for far too long
In our lost slumbers
For the burnt animals and the aged dead
At the gates of Kidal we must assemble
And fight
As strong as you might be
You will burn in your fireYou might also likeEmbed
