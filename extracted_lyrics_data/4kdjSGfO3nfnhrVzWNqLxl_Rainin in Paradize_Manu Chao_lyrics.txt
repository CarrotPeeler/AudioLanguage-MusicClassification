In Zaire, was no good place to be
Free world go crazy, it's an atrocity
In Congo, still no good place to be
They killed Mibali, it's a calamity
Go Maasai go Maasai, be mellow
Go Maasai go Maasai be sharp (Today it's raining)
Go Maasai go Maasai, be mellow
Go Maasai go Maasai be sharp (Today it's raining)
In Monrovia, this no good place to be
Weapon go crazy, it's an atrocity
In Palestina, too much hypocricy
