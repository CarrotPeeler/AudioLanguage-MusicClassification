2 ContributorsHell to Heaven Lyrics
Sacrificing rappers like calf with sworn Catholics
Born savage these fags are on acid
Catch stab wounds and be gashed with torn fabrics
War havoc storms pass with more static
It seems nowadays these kids are born addicts
Teens leave their dorms to become a porn actress
Left their parents' home then came back with worn asses
Thought he was a geek who read books and wore glasses
But he partied every week and missed all his core classes
Came back home after being beat down in whore fashion
Parents locked the door and shut it closed
Practice throwing daggers and javelins through you slutty bastards
They like gargoyles as solid as stone but they still attack you
Armour fully equipped with swords and golden axes
No need to copy and paste here’s where the fax is
The fact is that rappers are whack now where the trash is
Baskets with racks and stacks of old placards
Chips in debits cards unfolds the globe's rapture

God bless who the best be
Go ahead and test me

With demons by my side and the devil in my mind
I found myself in hell and I had lost track of time
Many days had passed and seasons did too
Then I was touched by an angel and that angel was you
I felt the warmth of your touch as the darkness was lifted by your light
And you whispered to me softly, "Rise up and fight"
I stood before Satan as he offered me his lies
Deceived by his words as my loved ones cried
Demons began chanting as he walked me to his throne
Give me your soul and I will never lead you wrong
Then you touched my heart and I heard the trumpets sound
And I stared Satan right in his eyes as I tore his kingdom down
You took my lifeless soul and gave me the breath of life
I'm living proof that God is real even on the darkest of the nights
You might also like
God bless who the best be
Go ahead and test me

I’m embracing my dreams
Took every bit of what I been
The extremes made me who I am here is how I vent
Heaven sent when I mention
So listen while you're paying attention be attentive to life's lesson no second guessing
I've reckoned plenty survived what was meant to get me
I was lucky to make it through to see
So if you're hearing this then it means I made it
Certain why I'm still alive is not to be rich and famous
More like feel my flame lit
Saying talking while I'm swaying
Smiling while I'm singing my songs as there coming along
Coming on strong
Don’t be shy go ahead & sing along
Not a clue what I’ve done to dudes
Don't care if you’re a gangster
Go ahead and watch me
I'm like that carbon copy

God bless who the best be
Go ahead and test meEmbed
