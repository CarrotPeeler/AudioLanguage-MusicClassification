3 ContributorsCondition of My Heart LyricsHow much time
Has passed since you said goodbye
Got your message today
Asking how am I
When I'm doing just fine
To admit the truth hasn't crossed my mind
All I needed was some time
Was it always this strong
I remember all
How I cried
The night that you said goodbye
You expected me to die
But I made a brand new start
And got on with my life
I did what I had to do
To get myself over you
I'm not fallin' apart
You underestimate the condition of my heart
There was a time
You were every breath of mine
I was ready to give the rest of my life
(but you walked away)
And now you think that you could walk right back into my life
Like nothing happened and I
I won't put up a fight
No
You left me alone
I wanna know where were you
You might also likeWhen I cried
The night that you said goodbye
You expected me to die
But I made a brand new start
And got on with my life
I did what I had to do
To get myself over you
I'm not fallin' apart
You underestimate the condition of my heart
I think you said all that you need to say
Cause it's not gonna matter anyway
Am I getting through to you
Ive heard it all before
And now you've changed your mind
You lost youre only chance when you said goodbye
I wanna know where were you when I cried
The night that you said goodbye
You expected me to die
But I made a brand new start
And got on with my life
I did what I had to do
To get myself over you
I'm not fallin' apart
You underestimate the condition of my heart
You underestimate the condition of my heartEmbed
