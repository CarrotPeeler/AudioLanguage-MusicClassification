4 ContributorsAutumn Song Lyrics
Leaves of brown they fall to the ground
And it's here, over there leaves abound
Shut the door, dim the lights and relax
What is more, your desire or the facts?

Pitter patter, the rain falling down
A little glimmer, sun coming round
And take a walk when autumn comes to town

Little stroll past the house on the hill
Some more coal on the fire, if you will
And in a week or two will be Halloween
Set the page and the stage for the scene

A little game that children will play
And as we watch them, wile time away
Look at me and take my breath away (Yeah, mmm)

You'll be smiling, eyes beguiling
And the song on the breeze
Will call my name out in your dreams
You might also like
Chestnuts roasting outside
As you walk with your love by your side
The old accordion man plays mellow and bright
And you go home in the crispness of the night

Little later, friends will be along
And if you feel like joining the throng
You just might feel like singing autumn song
Just may feel like


You'll be smiling, eyes beguiling
And the song on the breeze
Call my name out in your dreams

Chestnuts roasting outside
As you walk with your love by your side
And the old accordion man plays mellow, mellow and bright
And you go home in the crispness of the night

A little later, friends will be along
And if you feel like joining the throng
You just might feel like singing autumn song
Autumn song
You just may break out
You just may break out
You just may
You just may have to break out
You just may
You just may have to lose control
You just may have to lose control
'Cause you got it in your soul
You just may
Just may have to break out
You just may
You just may have to break out
Da da da, da da da, da da da
Break out
Da da da, da da da, da da da
Da da da, da da da, da da da, da da da, da da da
Hear what I'm singing
Da da da, da da da, da da da
Way out in the distance
Da da da, da da da, da da da
Way out in the distance
Da da da, da da da, da da da
Da da da, da da da, da da da
Way over in the corner
Way out in the distance
A cable car
And I hear the church bell chime
And I hear the church bell chime, mmm
Way out in the distance
Way out in the distance
Mmm
Mmm
Infinitesimal
Beauty of your eyes
Catches me in my starlight
Gazin', gazin'
And I'm embracin' somethin'
Turn around
Hand on my shoulder
Sayin'
It's so peaceful
It's so peaceful
Inside
Inside
Inside
I believe I've
I believe I've
Transcended myself, child
Transcended myself, child
Transcended myself, child
Da da da da, da da da da daEmbed
