You know you've got to get away
You want to leave the past behind
But when you go off on a search for yourself
You might not like what you find

Because the devil lurks on the road
Oh yes, the devil lurks on the road

Nobody here knows who you are
You needn't worry what they think
You're coming closer to the darkness in your heart
It's left you standing on the brink

Because the devil lurks on the road
Oh yes, the devil lurks on the road

The ghost of love it haunts you still
And now it feels out of control
You will not know that you are too far gone
Until that chasm rushes up
You might also like
Because the devil lurks on the road
Oh yes, the devil lurks on the road

Lurks on the road
Lurks on the road
Lurks on the road
Lurks on the roadEmbed
