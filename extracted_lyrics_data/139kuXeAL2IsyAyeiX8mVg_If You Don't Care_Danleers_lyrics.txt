3 ContributorsGet Yo Money Sis Lyrics
It's them dubs in the house
Hello, shoutout to PRA niggas in the building
(DTB on a beat that slap)
Well well well well well

Man I got these hoes in freak mode, fully clothed
Bussin' that shit open, hit rollin' all outta control
Finna call up persians, borrow the pole
Fuck that, I told these hoes c'mon, we finna get it on
Hit the club, light the bitch up
Dog water for me, and forty two and rose, for the hoes
Ordered three bricks in ones, and started goin' crazy
De ja vu, I used to feed ducks at Laney
Dance her ex , I scoot her closer
Then I told her, a goer, the house mom
The manager, the owner, all in that order
Took the plug out her asshole so now she bent over
Shoulda never wore these joggers, 'cause my shit raisin'
Put my dick on my belt line, and kept rainin'
When I'm off this dog I'm so outta pocket
I'm a clumsy motherfucker, I be breakin' wallets
It's something 'bout the way you throw it back baby
Bend it over for a thug, clap baby
You make me wanna pound (Oh my god)
I love it when you put your hands on the ground
Somethin' 'bout the way you throw it back baby (Do it)
Bend it over for a thug, clap baby (Clap it clap it)
You make me wanna pound (Oh my god)
I love it when you put your hands on the ground (I love it)
You might also like
You got me hypnotized, I see dollar signs in your eyes
I love me a get money bitch, (Yes I do)
Don't give a fuck how you get it girl, just get it
Grab it, stash it, Shout out them bitches all about they chicken
Not them dick dizzy hoes that be lettin' niggas spend it
I don't discriminate, take 'em small, take 'em tall
I like , curly, and all
That lace front , granny wig, I love 'em ball
I like 'em skinny, bulky, chunky, , I even like 'em fifty and up, literally
I know you insecure, suspect niggas don't feel me
Bet when your bitch play my song, it make you wanna kill me (Sucka)
Aye sis, if that nigga ain't doin' his job (Hahaha) I got you
No I got you, hit me up I got a play runner who like to share the ball (PRA)

You got me hypnotized, I see dollar signs in your eyes (Shake that shit)
I love me a get money bitch, (Shake that shit)
Don't give a fuck how you get it girl, just get it (Shake that shit)
Grab it, stash it
It's something 'bout the way you throw it back baby (Shake that shit)
Bend it over for a thug, clap baby
You make me wanna pound (You better do something)
I love it when you put your hands on the ground (Something is better than nothing)
Omg, wow, shake that shit
Head to the locker room, get dressed now (Shake that shit)
Shoutout all my bitches fuckin' up the pole (Get yo' money sis)
Fuck a hater, get yo' bankroll
Hello? DTB thank you
