“Don Your Looking So Fine”

Didn’t wanna fall apart
Didn’t wanna no no
I’ve been in my head lately
Take me off the camera baby

Didn’t want it to end like this
You the only one I miss
You know he a lame better call it quits
I know you want me so you called it splits
I know you want me baby
I just want my cheese baby
You might also likeYou just got to believe baby

Didn’t wanna fall apart
Didn’t wanna no no
I’ve been in my head lately
Take me off the camera baby

Didn’t want it to end like this
You the only one I miss
You know he a lame better call it quits
I know you want me so you called it splits
I know you want me baby
I just want my cheese baby
You just got to believe babyEmbed
