2 ContributorsS.O.P.H.I.A LyricsAs I drift away into sandman's embrace
My soul stretches out like a caged bird that yearns to fly
Trapped in a nightmare, harrowing reverie
All darkness crumbles as I reach my hand to you
Far away, breaking the distance
What kind of miracle are you waiting for?
Falling, please embrace me
A raging whisper inside
As my spirit floats in the vast, dreamy space
There's a light closing in, makes my eyes fill with stars
Showered in light, an eerie sound calling me
Echoes through my veins as my voice calls out to you
I've never met such a destiny
What kind of miracle are you waiting for?
Behind this a horizon of sound
A raging whisper inside
And in sunlit fields where the flowers grow tall
And your sound fills the air, makes the earth feel so small
Synchronizing minds, distant heartbeats align
In the sky, conscience awakes and we're closer than ever before
You might also likeLong live life, cross my heart
And those words you feed to the light
I wonder if I can touch you
Wanna feel you right now
One, what is the passion of music?
Two, what is the message of your voice?
Three, what is the power of sound?
Four, these are all in my life
And I'm in front of this universe
We're just empty lovers' vows
And in sunlit fields where the flowers grow tall
And your sound fills the air, makes the earth feel so small
Synchronizing minds, distant heartbeats align
In the sky, conscience awakes and we're closer than ever beforeEmbed
