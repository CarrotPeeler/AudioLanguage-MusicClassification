11 ContributorsSpirit of the Stairwell Lyrics
Scratched out a note I wrote for you
To wake and read
And know that I was there once
I knew that there was nothing that I could write to assure you
Of my return
But all the paper said when I was done is
‘do you still want me?’
Because I’d be terrified if I had to leave this place today
We haven’t saved the baby

As I said
My darling
Spring is constantly calling me
And there’s no place that I’d rather be

I won’t be angry
If you have to leave
But I won’t be waiting for that day
So don’t say you’re sorry because
I won’t believe you

I didn’t see a sticker on the door when we walked in
But I know it’s going to cost us
The same amount of love it takes to get you through
But it never moves you
I’d be terrified if I had to leave this place today
It’s where I threw my love away
Then we saw a different side of Annie nobody saw
She tried to kill the baby
You might also like
And the earth and its skin will open up
And birth out a perfect mirror
That makes all our reflections clear

I won’t be angry
If you have to leave
But I won’t be waiting for that day
So don’t say you’re sorry because
I won’t believe youEmbed
