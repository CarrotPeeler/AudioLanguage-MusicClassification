2 ContributorsSpeed LyricsI got speed
I don't know where I'm going
But I've got everything I need
I got a picture
Trapped inside my head
How I think that it should be
Oh, I got speed
I got speed
But the man in the suit he won't let me
I got wheels
And the sound of them always sets me free
I got speed, I got speedYou might also likeEmbed
