4 ContributorsJust in Time Lyrics
Just in time, you found me just in time
Before you came my time was running low
I was lost, them losing dice were tossed
My bridges all were crossed, nowhere to go
Now you're here and I know where I'm going
No more doubt or fear, I've found my way...


Just in time, you found me
Before you came my time was running low
I was lost, them losing dice were tossed
My bridges all were crossed, nowhere to go, nowhere to
Now you're here and I know where I'm going
No more doubt, no more fear, I've found my way
So let's live today, any way
Changed me, changed me, changed me once again
And changed my lonely nights that lucky dayYou might also likeEmbed
