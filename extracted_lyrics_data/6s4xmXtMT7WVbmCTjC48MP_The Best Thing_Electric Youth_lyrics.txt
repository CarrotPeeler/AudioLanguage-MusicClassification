6 ContributorsThe Best Thing LyricsMonkeys on their back
A scorpion's on yours
You know their hearts are black
They can't follow the course
You'd only take a life
That was already over
To save another
No guns or bombs or knives
Your hammer, your hands
Your heart is full
And you, and you
Are the best thing that's ever happened to me
And you, and you
Are the best thing that's ever happened to me
And you, and you
Are the best thing that's ever happened to me
And you, and you
Are the best thing that's ever happened to me
They say you have no name
They say you show no signs
And who you are by the day
Isn't the same in the night
But you'd only take a life
That was already over to save another
No guns or bombs or knives
Your hammer, your hands
Your heart is full
You might also likeAnd you, and you
Are the best thing that's ever happened to me
And you, and you
Are the best thing that's ever happened to me
And you, and you
Are the best thing that's ever happened to me
And you, and you
Are the best thing that's ever happened to me4Embed
