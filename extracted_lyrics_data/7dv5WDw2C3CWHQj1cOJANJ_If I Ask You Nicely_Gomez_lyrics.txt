1 ContributorIf I Ask You Nicely LyricsNo perforation, in your thick skin
She's for leaving, you're for fixing
Party's over even in the kitchen
Take the taste away
You were winning, till they changed ends
Said the drinker to the bartend
No reputation left to defend
Broken hearts and bones
Talking on the telephone
Saying hey la la hey la la
Oh would you
Could you
If I asked you nicely would you
In the ship's hold, you were patient
For the verdict of the nation
Telephone broke watch the animation
What will they say
Whose tune will she play
Saying hey la la hey la la
Oh would you
Could you
If I asked you nicely would you

No matter what we do
One day we may find we got left behind
You can run, baby you can hide
But one day you will find you got left behind
You got left behind
Hey la la
Oh would you
Could you
If I ask you nicely would youEmbed
