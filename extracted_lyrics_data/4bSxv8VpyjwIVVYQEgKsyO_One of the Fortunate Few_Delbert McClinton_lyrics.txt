2 ContributorsOne of the Fortunate Few LyricsWell for one thing, there was a whole lot of guys
Who'd like to be in my shoes
But the upkeep on a woman like that
Give an old poor boy the blues
Still the pleasure was worth the pain
Of everything she put me through
And I consider myself one of the fortunate few
Yeah and another thing She wasn't just good looking
Her imagination just wouldn't quit
She'd make you do things you never thought about
And things you wouldn't want to admit
There must be somebody else out there
That feels about her like I do

It felt so good to hurt so bad
The best and worst that I ever had
I know I bit off more than I could chew
Still I consider myself one of the fortunate few
Well that's the last thing I want to tell you
Some things are better left unsaid
A gentleman don't go talking about
What happens in a woman's bed
That's all I've got to say
I'll leave the rest up to you
But I consider myself one of the fortunate fewEmbed
