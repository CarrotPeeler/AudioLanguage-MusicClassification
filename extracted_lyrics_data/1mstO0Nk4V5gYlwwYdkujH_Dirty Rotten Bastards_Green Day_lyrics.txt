33 ContributorsDirty Rotten Bastards Lyrics

Yeah, yeah yeah
Yeah, yeah yeah
Yeah, yeah yeah
Yeah, yeah yeah

Calling all demons, this is the season
Next stop is therapy
We're the retarded and the brokenhearted
The season of misery
Here's to the wasted, I can almost taste it
The rejects, and waste of times
Gonna take it further, get away with murder
And no one here is getting out alive
Here's to all God's losers, ra da-da da-dee!
The bottom-feeders' frenzy
Here's to all bloodsuckers, sing along with me
'Cause we don't say "no," scream one, two, three!

Yeah, yeah yeah
Yeah, yeah yeah
Hey!
See Green Day LiveGet tickets as low as $55You might also like

We're too old to be misbehaved
We sold our souls, and so ashamed of ourselves
So we wait for Miss Judgment Day
Write me a letter and send it to my grave, yeah


All fucked up, beyond intervention
Fuck the world, this is my revolution!
Long lost souls and living in cages
I'm on a bender, it's one for the ages

I've got the urge to binge and surge
The tables turn to crash and burn

Juliana Homicide
Make my demons come to life
Well, Juliana Homicide
Oh, won't you be my blushing bride?
I chopped me a line of my best friend's ashes
Dust to dust when the red light flashes
What the fuck does OK stand for?
When the afterlife is only worth dying for

I've got the urge to binge and surge
The tables turn to crash and burn

Juliana Homicide
Make my demons come to life
Well, Juliana Homicide
Oh, won't you be my blushing bride? Alright!



Well, California's burning to the ground
And Juliana walks on holy ground
Where there's smoke, there's fire burning out the lights
'Cause California's burning down tonight, tonight

Calling all demons, this is the season
Next stop is therapy
We're the retarded and the brokenhearted
The season of misery
Here's to the wasted, I can almost taste it
The rejects and waste of times
Gonna take it further, get away with murder
And no one here is getting out alive
Here's to all God's losers, ra da-da da-dee!
The bottom-feeders' frenzy
Here's to all bloodsuckers, sing along with me
'Cause we don't say "no," scream one, two, three!


We're carried away, carried away, carried away
We're carried away, carried away, carried away
We're carried away, carried away, carried away
We're carried away, carried away, carried away
We're carried away, carried away, carried away
We're carried away, carried away, carried away3Embed
