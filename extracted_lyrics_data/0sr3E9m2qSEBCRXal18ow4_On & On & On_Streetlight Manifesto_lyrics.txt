10 ContributorsOn & On & On Lyrics
I still remember that night it was the 4th of July
Still engraved in my mind and I'm not surprised
Gang wars, no guns, hand to hand
Black, and white, and purple
But they still don't understand
I'm gonna be alright, I'm gonna be okay
Everything is gonna be fi-i-i-ine
Back off, I wanna be alone
I wanna think it out, I'm thinking I want to go home

Looks who's laughing now (look who's laughing now)
Pull it off somehow and I said
As I pass her by, I can see her cry
And I'll never forget the look that was in her eye
And when the music you know it played on and on and on
So won't somebody tap her on the shoulder and tell her life goes on?

3 years, 2 months, 1 week, 4 days
I'm always counting down
'Cause there ain't no easier way
So trust me, you know that I tried
And if I say it's easy then you know that I told you a lie
You might also likeI'm gonna be alright
I'm gonna be just fine
One down, 5 billion left to go
Am I next in line do I really want to know?

Looks who's laughing now (look who's laughing now)
Pull it off somehow and I said
As I pass her by, I can see her cry
And I'll never forget the look that was in her eye
And when the music you know it played on and on and on
So won't somebody tap her on the shoulder and tell her life goes on?


Well, I still remember that night it was the 4th of July
Still engraved in my mind and I'm not surprised
Gang wars, no guns, hand to hand
Black, and white, and purple
But they still don't understand
I'm gonna be alright, I'm gonna be okay
Everything is gonna be fine
Back off, I wanna be alone
I wanna think it out, I'm thinking I want to goâ€¦
3 years, 2 months, 1 week, 4 days
I am always counting down
'Cause there ain't no easier way
So trust me, you know that I tried
And if I say it's easy then you know that I told you a lie
I'm gonna be alright
I'm gonna be just fine
One down 5 billion left to go
Am I next in line do I really want to know?

Looks who's laughing now (look who's laughing now)
Pull it off somehow and I said
As I pass her by, I can see her cry
And I'll never forget the look that was in her eye
And when the music you know it played on and on and on
So won't somebody tap her on the shoulder and tell her life goes on?
