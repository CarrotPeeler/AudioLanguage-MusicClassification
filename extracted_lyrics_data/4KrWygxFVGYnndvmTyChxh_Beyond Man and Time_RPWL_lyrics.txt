2 ContributorsBeyond Man and Time LyricsHere I am, waiting for nothing
Beyond your time and space
You may ask for a reason
What occured when I lived at your place
I better don't talk round corners
I saw the just man telling his lies
Monochrome what was multicoloured
Moralizing creeps in disguise
A world with no light
A mind with no will
A will without power
To sail to the sea
See me beyond man and time
Loneliness is my bride-to-be
Where honesty ends I want to be blind
There's nothing else I want to see
Born into this world with the soul of a child
But see what has been revealed
This world could have been a better place
But my ears learned to see
Drowned in a sea full of misery
Unable to dance in their mind
Caged in the past and the future
So I made my way into the night
You might also likeI better don't talk round corners
Being equal they're falling apart
I saw disgust in their being
The moment when I chose to be blind
A world with no light
A mind with no will
And no wind is blowing
To sail to the sea
See me beyond man and time
Loneliness is my bride-to-be
Where honesty ends I want to be blind
There's nothing else I want to see
Born into this world with the soul of a child
But see what has been revealed
This world could have been a better place
But my ears learned to seeEmbed
