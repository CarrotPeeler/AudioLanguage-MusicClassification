Roots rock, riot! Roots rock

So much blood spilt pon de dance floor
Just like Oliver Twist you know you're begging for more
Raw to the maximum, broke down the law
Sweat and clarity increase ya visure
Ah we no want no badness bout ya
And everyone push up your lighter
Let me see you bouncing in the area
Call the police, we come to murder

And so the music flows everybody knows

Musical murder in the room tonight
You know we're bouncing everyone hold tight
Just keep on moving from the wrong to right
Roots rock riot
Musical murder in the room tonight
You know we're bouncing everyone hold tight
Just keep on moving from the wrong to right
Roots rock riot
Roots rock, riot
Roots rock
See Skindred LiveGet tickets as low as $95You might also like
Co me say so many people dem ah rock in the place
Can't find no room, you know you can't find space
The energy's ecstatic as you're smashing up the place
You'll fall down if you can't take the pace

And so the music flows everybody knows

Musical murder in the room tonight
You know we're bouncing everyone hold tight
Just keep on moving from the wrong to right
Roots rock riot
Musical murder in the room tonight
You know we're bouncing everyone hold tight
Just keep on moving from the wrong to right

This is a murder murder musical ma-ma-ma-murder murder
Pushing it fa-fa-fa-further further pushing it! Now hear this
Roots Rock Riot!
Riot, roots rock
Riot, roots rock
Riot, roots rock
Riot, roots rock
The equalizer and the compression
Turn up the bass it's time for confession
No bodder with the fuckery pay your concession
If you get ejected there's no readmission
Feel the injection slaughtered composition musician
We took it right down real low then just let it go
Roots rock riot!
This is a murder murder musical ma-ma-ma-murder murder
Pushing it fa-fa-fa-further further pushing it! Now hear this
