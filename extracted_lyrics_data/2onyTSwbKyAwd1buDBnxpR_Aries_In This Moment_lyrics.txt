5 ContributorsAries LyricsI was alone
I was tied
And you saved me
You set my heart on fire
You gave me life
Now you rise
Headed for the Sun
And I know I'm right behind you
Live like you feel
Reach for the unknown
And know my fire is always with youSee In This Moment LiveGet tickets as low as $17Embed
