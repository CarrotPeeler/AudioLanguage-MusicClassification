2 ContributorsJennie Lee Lyrics"Wait for me", cried the lonely man
As a hungry river rushed by
"Wait for me, sweet Jennie Lee"
He whispered with a sigh
Everywhere I look
Everything I see
Reminds me of my love
Wait for me
Wait for me
My sweet Jennie Lee
Everywhere I look
Everything I see
Reminds me of my love
Wait for me
Wait for me
My sweet Jennie Lee
My sweet Jennie Lee
My sweet Jennie Lee
My sweet Jennie LeeYou might also likeEmbed
