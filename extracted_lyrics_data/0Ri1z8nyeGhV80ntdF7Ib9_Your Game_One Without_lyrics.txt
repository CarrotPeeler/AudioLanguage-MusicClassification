1 ContributorYour Game LyricsSurrounded by the ever-screaming
Echoes of your voice
Can't see the truth though evidence
Is right before my eyes
You led me in to your game
And never cared because
You leave the riddle unsolved
Forcing me to throw away
A life that could have been
Much more than a show
For you
I think of all the time that we
Spent and now it's gone
I know it's for the best
But it is hard to be alone
You led me in to your game
And never cared because
You leave the riddle unsolved
Forcing me to throw away
A life that could have been
Much more than a show
For you
You might also likeYou leave the riddle unsolved
Forcing me to throw away
You leave the riddle unsolved
You're forcing me to throw away
A life that could have been
So much moreEmbed
