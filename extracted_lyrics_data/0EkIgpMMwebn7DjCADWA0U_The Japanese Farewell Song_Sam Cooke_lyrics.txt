3 ContributorsThe Japanese Farewell Song Lyrics
The time has come for us to say sayonara
My heart will always be yours for eternity
I knew some time we'd have to say sayonara
Please promise that you'll be returning someday to me

I'll remember our romance until the day that I die
I'll see your face in the moon and stars in the sky

So, hold me close before you say sayonara
And promise that you'll always keep me near to your heart


I'll remember our romance until the day that I die
I'll see your face in the moon and stars in the sky

So, hold me close before you say sayonara
And promise that you'll always keep me near to your heart
Always keep me near to your heartYou might also likeEmbed
