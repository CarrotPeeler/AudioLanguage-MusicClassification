3 ContributorsA-OK LyricsYou think that I'm invincible
It's going to pull me down, pull me down
You think that I'm invisible
It's going to pull me down
It's somewhere I don't want to go
It's okay
You think I'm indestructible
It's going to pull me down, pull me down
You think that I'm a miracle
It's going to pull me down
To somewhere I don't want to go
It's okay
I don't know what you want from me
But it's probably already gone
I don't care what you think of me
Your opinion means nothing at all
Don't say I'm okay
Don't say I'm okay
Don't say I'm okay
I'm not okay
Don't say I'm okay
Don't say I'm okay
Don't say I'm okay
I'm not okay
You might also likeDon't say I'm not trying
Trying to do what's right
Now it's time to walk away
I don't know what you want from me
But it's probably already gone
I don't care what you think of me
Your opinion means nothing at all
Don't say I'm okay
Don't say I'm okay
Don't say I'm okay
I'm not okay
Don't say I'm okay
Don't say I'm okay
Don't say I'm okay
I'm not okay
Don't say I'm okay
Don't say I'm okay
Don't say I'm okay
Don't say I'm okay
Don't say I'm okay
Don't say I'm okay
Don't say I'm okay
I'm not okay5Embed
