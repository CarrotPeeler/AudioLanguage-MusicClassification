1 ContributorAll Shook Up LyricsWell bless my soul
What's wrong with me?
I'm itchin' like a man on a fuzzy tree
My friends say I'm actin' wild as a bug
I'm in love
I'm all shook up
Mm mm mm, mm, yeah, yeah, yeah
Well, my hands are shaky and my knees are weak
I can't seem to stand on my own two feet
Who do you thank when you have such luck?
I'm in love
I'm all shook up
Mm mm mm, mm, yeah, yeah
I'm all shook up
Well, please don't ask me what's on my mind
I'm a little mixed up, but I'm feelin' fine
When I'm near that girl that I love best
My heart beats so it scares me to death!
Well she touched my hand and what a chill I got
Her lips are like a volcano that's hot
I'm proud to say that she's my buttercup
I'm in love
I'm all shook up
Mm mm mm, mm, yeah, yeah
I'm all shook up
Yeah!

My insides shake like a leaf on a tree
There's only one cure for this soul of mine
That's to have that girl that I love so fine
Well she touched my hands and what a chill I got
Her lips are like a volcano that's hot
I'm proud to say that she's my buttercup
I'm in love
I'm all shook up
Mm mm mm, mm, yeah, yeah, yeah
Mm mm mm, mm, yeah, yeah
I'm all shook upEmbed
