Your eyes are tired
And the walls are moving, slowly
I'm taking the wind now
I never loved you
Love ain't friendzy
On a one man show
If you don't know where you're going
Any road will take you there
If you don't know
If you don't know
If you don't know where your going
Any road will take you there
If you don't know
If you don't know
Five years later
Not so crazy
Repaint the picture
You're a real van Gogh
Counting the days now
The consequences
Echo in laughter
More seeds to sow
