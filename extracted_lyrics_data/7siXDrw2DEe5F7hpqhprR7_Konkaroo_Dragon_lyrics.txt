1 ContributorDragon LyricsThere was this Dragon, came from New Zealand
Flew in on the April Sun and made Sydney his home
His name was Konkaroo, he was the king from coast to coast
But then he got sick of breathing fire and he, he really missed his home
D-d-d-d-d-d-dragon
He was a five-headed beast: Mark, Todd, Paul, Robert and Neil
This time, get that jive, I’m still in love with you
And are you old enough to go on the rollercoaster
Konkaroo went on too many times so he, he had to go back homе
