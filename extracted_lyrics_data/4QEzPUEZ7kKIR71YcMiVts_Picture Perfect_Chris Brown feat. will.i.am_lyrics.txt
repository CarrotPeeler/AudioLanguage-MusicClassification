9 ContributorsPicture Perfect Lyrics
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Uh-oh, uh-oh
Uh-oh, uh-oh
You might've seen her on every cover
Of every magazine but can't nobody get her but me
Uh-oh, there she go, uh-oh, there she go
Uh-oh, there she go, can't nobody get her but me

Hot damn, let me tell you man (Uh)
She looks so good, I'ma say it again (Uh)
So good that I can't explain
When she do what she do, she's gon' do her thing
Over here Ms. Lane (Oh)
Come on, get fly with a Superman (Oh)
You ain't got to worry, I won't play no games
Baby, tonight

So don't front, you know you wanna stay
It's all fun, so, baby, come and play

It's picture perfect, the way you work it, girl
What's your purpose? 'Cause I deserve it, girl, oh
Before we get into something crazy
All you fellas back up off my lady
Get you one 'cause I got that one
Get you one 'cause I got that one
Get you one 'cause I got that one
Get you one 'cause I got that, got that (Ooh)
It's the way she wears her clothes, her beauty overload
The definition of a star (Wanna meet her?)

Of every magazine but can't nobody get her but me
Uh-oh, there she go, uh-oh, there she go
Uh-oh, there she go, can't nobody get her but me

Damn, girl, set my flame ablaze (Uh)
Top model chick from my favorite page (Uh)
At the same time from around the way
When she break it down, she gon' do her thing (Huh)
After the beat drop
You can hear the bass from the parking lot
You ain't gotta worry, you won't tell me stop
Baby, tonight

So don't front, you know you wanna stay
It's all fun, so, baby, come and play

It's picture perfect, the way you work it, girl

Uh-oh, there she go, can't nobody get her but me

Hot damn, I got the hottest chick (Yep)
She gotta be a goddess, her body's sick (Yep)
3D booty like holy ****
She's holdin' them Angelina Jolie lips (Hold up)
With the tig ol' bits (And now)
Willy get whipped when she wiggles it (A feature presentation)
She jiggles it, my stick gets stiff
Make a brother think she a hypnotist (Hyp-hyp-hyp)
'Cause she hypnotize
Brothers gon' trip when she arrive
Lookin' like she fell out the sky
Heaven's missin' an angel, God's gon' cry
'Cause she chillin' with me
I am Willy in love with Double D cups
And she stack plenty
Just need one, I don't need many
She loves me, never money or pennies
Look if you want, brother, you ain't gettin' any
That's mine, yep yep, that's right, sonny
Get you one 'cause that's my honey
Get you one 'cause I got that one (Yeah)
Get you one 'cause I got that one (Yeah)
Get you one 'cause I got that one (Yeah)
Get you one 'cause I got that, got that
It's the way she wears her clothes, her beauty overload (Ooh)
The definition of a star

Get you one 'cause I got that one (Ooh)
Get you one 'cause I got that one
Get you one 'cause I got that one
Get you one 'cause I got that, got that, got that, got that
Got that, got that, got that, got that, got that4Embed
