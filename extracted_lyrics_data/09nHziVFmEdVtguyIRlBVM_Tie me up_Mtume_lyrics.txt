- It's 3 o'clock, what's up?
- Nothing's happenin' tonight, I can't believe it!
What a drag, heh. (Yeah, yeah...)
- How does that party at Neil's?
- Oh, that's the place down on the avenue!
Yeah, I heard about that, yeah...
- Let's go see that, then
- Yeah, why not?

- Yeah, who is it?
- Yeah, we're here to check out the set
- Who's playing tonight?
- Mtume’s getting ready to go out now. Come on in!
- Ooh, I like them! Oh, well, that's those "Juicy Fruit" people! Haha

Y'all ready to get down tonight? Alright
"Now hit it"? Alright now, we're gonna hit it, we're gonna hit

I love the way you wiggle
Wiggle right across the floor
Tie me up
I love the way you wiggle
Wiggle right across the floor
Tie me up
I love the way you wiggle
Wiggle right across the floor
Tie me up (What's the chase?)
I love the way you wiggle
Wiggle right across the floor
