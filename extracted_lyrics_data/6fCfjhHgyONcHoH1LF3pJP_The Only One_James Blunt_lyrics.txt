4 ContributorsThe Only One Lyrics
Did all the words I never said
Hurt as bad as those I did?
You know I never even cared not before you
If I could go and turn back time
If I could only press rewind
I would bleed this heart of mine
Just to show you

I'll be the first to say I'm sorry
The first to say I'm stupid
Why do I always take it there?
Is it hopeless or maybe you still want to
Meet me at the altar?
And I will lay it all to bare

And I told you all my secrets
All my fears, I've let go
And it's flawless
You are the only one
You are the only one
Don't you know
Don't you know?

Am I fading from your mind
Has the distance blurred the lines?
They say all things heal with time
But it's untrue
I will linger on every word
I know it's more than I deserve
Chances are I'll make it worse

But I need to tell you
Tell you that I'm sorry
Tell you that I'm stupid
Why do I always take it there?
Is it hopeless or maybe you still want to
Meet me at the altar?
And I will lay it all to bare

And I told you all my secrets
All my fears, I've let go
And it's flawless
You are the only one
You are the only one
Don't you know
Don't you know?
Don't you know
That the hardest part's not having you to hold?
Don't you know
This old heart of mine can't bear to see you go?

And I told you all my secrets
All my fears, I've let go
And it's flawless
You are the only one
You are the only one
Don't you know
Don't you know?
And I told you all my secrets
All my fears, I've let go
And it's flawless
You are the only one
You are the only one
Don't you know
Don't you know?
And I told you all my secrets
All my fears, I've let go
And it's flawless
You are the only one
You are the only one
Don't you know
Don't you know?Embed
