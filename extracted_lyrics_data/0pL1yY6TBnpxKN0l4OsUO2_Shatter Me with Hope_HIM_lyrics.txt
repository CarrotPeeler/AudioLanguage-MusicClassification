The girl who cried love
Won't you come and play with me?
You can be Cassandra
Underneath the Sword of Damocles

We'll tear this baby apart
Wise like Solomon

Run, come shatter me now
Shatter me with hope
Crawl, come breathe me in
Bleed out all sorrows
Scream me a dream
Untouched by shadows
Baby, shatter me now, shatter me now
Shatter me with hope

She'll be the witness
To the repose of Evelyn
Push the needle in
To the canticles of ecstasy

Turn to page 43
And you'll know how I feel

Run, come shatter me now
Shatter me with hope
Crawl, come breathe me in
Bleed out all sorrows
Scream me a dream
Untouched by shadows
Baby, shatter me now, shatter me now
Shatter me with hope

Swear on your heart's grave I'm wrong
And love like your life's depending on it
Because it is

We'll tear this baby apart
Wise like Solomon
Turn to page 43
And you'll know how I feel

Run, come shatter me now
Shatter me with hope
Crawl, come breathe me in
Bleed out all sorrows
Scream me a dream
Untouched by shadows
Baby, shatter me now, shatter me now
Shatter me with hope
Shatter me now, shatter me now
Shatter me with hope
Shatter me now, shatter me now
Shatter me with hope
Scream me a dream
Scream me a dreamEmbed
