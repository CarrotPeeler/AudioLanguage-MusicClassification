2 ContributorsFirefly LyricsI went to your bedroom to see you again
To miss you that much and for such a long time
I went to the aisle to marry your soul
To miss you that much
Missing you broke my life
Hoping that you feel the same
Missing you broke my life
Missing you broke my life
Hoping that you feel the same
Missing you broke my life
It’s all over now, you’ve killed me
It’s all over now, you’ve killed me
It’s all over now, you’ve killed me
It’s all over now
Fear is compressed in the back of my stomach
The rust in my eyes from my corroded halo
I remember your smile, distorted and pure
To hold you ’til death
Missing you broke my life
Hoping that you feel the same
Missing you broke my life
You might also likeMissing you broke my life
Hoping that you feel the same
Missing you broke my life
It’s all over now, you’ve killed me
It’s all over now, you’ve killed me
It’s all over now, you’ve killed me
It’s all over now
Missing you broke my life
Hoping that you feel the same
Missing you broke my life
Missing you broke my life
Hoping that you feel the same
Missing you broke my life
It’s all over now, you’ve killed me
It’s all over now, you’ve killed me
It’s all over now, you’ve killed me
It’s all over now
You’ve killed me (it’s all over now)
You’ve killed me (it’s all over now)
You’ve killed meEmbed
