You got to wake up early in the morning
You got to stay up all night long
You still won't catch up 'cause I got the warnin'
I got the feelin' you wanna do me wrong
Like a bolt of lightning and a ball of heat
You wanna knock me right off my feet
But I recognize through the eyes of a fool
You got the power to make your own rules

Shoorah, Shoorah
Hey, I can see you comin'
Shoorah, Shoorah
But you won't catch me
Shoorah, Shoorah
Hey, I can hear you hummin'
Shoorah, Shoorah
But you won't catch me

I can see you movin', movin' all around me
I know you're trying to get me upset
I can hear you groovin', thinkin' you done found me
But I'm here to tell you, you ain't got me yet, no, no
You might also like
Shoorah, Shoorah
Hey, I can see you comin'
Shoorah, Shoorah
But you won't catch me
Shoorah, Shoorah
Hey, I can hear you hummin'
Shoorah, Shoorah
But you won't catch me

I checked you out from the corner of my eye
You and the devil walkin' side by side
And you ain't changed, let's be real about it
And I can't change how I feel about it

Shoorah, Shoorah
Hey, I can see you comin'
Shoorah, Shoorah
But you won't catch me
Shoorah, Shoorah
Hey, I can hear you hummin'
Shoorah, Shoorah
But you won't catch me
Shoorah, Shoorah
Said I can see you comin'
Shoorah, Shoorah
But you won't catch me
Shoorah, Shoorah
Hey, I can hear you hummin'
Shoorah, Shoorah
But you won't catch me
Shoorah, Shoorah
Hey, I can see you comin'
Shoorah, Shoorah
But you won't catch me, no, no
Shoorah, Shoorah
Hey, I can hear you hummin'
Shoorah, Shoorah
But you won't catch me, noEmbed
