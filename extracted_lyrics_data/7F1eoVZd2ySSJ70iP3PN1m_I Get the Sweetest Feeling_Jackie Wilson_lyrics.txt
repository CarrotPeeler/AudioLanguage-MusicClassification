Mmm, the closer you get
The better you look, baby
The better you look
The more I want you
When you turn on your smile
I feel my heart go wild
I'm like a child with a brand new toy

And I get the sweetest feeling (Sweetest feeling)
Honey, the sweetest (Sweetest feeling)
Baby, the sweetest (Sweetest feeling)
Loving you

The warmer your kiss
The deeper you touch me, baby
The deeper your touch
The more you thrill me
It's more than I can stand
Girl, when you hold my hand
I feel so grand that I could cry

And I get the (Sweetest feeling)
Mama, the sweetest (Sweetest feeling)
Baby, the sweetest (Sweetest feeling)
Loving you
You might also like
Mmm, the greater your love
The stronger you hold me, baby
The stronger your hold
The more I need you
With every passing day
I love you more in every way
I'm in love to stay and I want to say

I get the (Sweetest feeling)
Baby, the sweetest (Sweetest feeling)
Honey, the sweetest (Sweetest feeling)
Loving you

Unh! (Sweetest feeling)
Baby, the sweetest (Sweetest feeling)
Sweetest (Sweetest feeling)1Embed
