5 ContributorsMistakes & Regrets Lyrics
If I could make a list
Of my mistakes and regrets
I'd put your name on top
And every line after it

'Cause every inch of hope
Becomes a world of shame
I've had to walk through
Each and every day

And if I screamed "you were wrong"
At the top of my lungs
You would never return
All the faith that I've lost

And there is nothing left to say
That has not been said
If I shouted, you wouldn't listen
I don't think it'd even sink in

If I could make a list
Of my mistakes and regrets
I'd put your name on top
And every line after it
You might also like
'Cause every inch of hope
Becomes a world of shame
I've had to walk through
Each and every day

And there is nothing left to say
That has not been said
If I shouted, would you listen?
I don't think it'd even sink in

The question
The stigma
The curse that you inflict
On me...
Guess who's ready
Guess who's ready
 x2
If you forget how to feel
Reach inside your chest
Is there a heart beating?
Is there just emptiness?Embed
