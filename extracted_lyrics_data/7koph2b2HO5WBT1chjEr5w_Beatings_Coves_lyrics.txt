1 ContributorBeatings LyricsYou say we’ll love forever
I close my heart to others
You said we’ll die together
But now you’ll lie forever
My heart stops beating for you
My heart stops beating for you
I’m cold now your blood has run through
My heart stops beating for you
You said you’d come for me
Now you’ve left me in the cold
I squeeze my hands to tight
Pins and needles in my soul
You said we’ll die together
I will sing why forever
My heart stops beating for you
My heart stops beating for you
I’m cold now your blood has run through
My heart stops beating for you
My heart stops beating for you
My heart stops beating for youYou might also likeEmbed
