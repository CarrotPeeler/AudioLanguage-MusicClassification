2 ContributorsImagine That Lyrics
Wassup, baby
Oh, you can't say "Wassup" back?
Anyway, I see you finally made it home
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know
Oh, you was too drunk to drive, huh?
Damn right, I got a problem
Huh, it's all good, trust me, it's all good

Imagine that your girl came home
Walking a little different
Got a pep in her step
She ain't paying you no attention
She hits the shower first (Shower first)
But she don't mention
She's washing off that dirt she done got in
Imagine if your girl was home
(And you get off work early)
She don't even know
'Cause she won't answer the phone
(But you sense something's up)
And barge through your front door
But there's a fellow running out your back door

What would you do? (What would you do?)
'Cause Shawty playing games with you while you at work
She been hitting you where it hurts (Ooh)
Got a couple dudes on her team but you don't know
In your home, she's always on the go
What would you do? (What would you do?)
Would you give a second chance
Hoping that it won't happen again?
Now flip that around, you know that's what we do
We tell them that we love them but our hearts ain't true
You might also like
Imagine if she crushed dudes like you crushed chicks
(Imagine that)
Have a starting five and your position was the bench
(Imagine that)
Busy when you call, don't return your messages
(Oh, imagine that)
Ball 'til she fall while you taking care of the kids
(Imagine that)
Imagine if she don't wanna tell you where she been
(Imagine that)
Said she hanging with her girls but she hanging out with him
(Oh, imagine that)
Imagine if everything that I said ain't true
She home alone waiting while you're out doing you

Imagine you were on the road
(And she call you and she say that she pregnant)
You ask how many months, she don't know yet
But you think to yourself
It's been a month since you been gone
Who been sneaking in when you're not at home?
Imagine now you're all alone
('Cause she took off with the other dude)
Left the dog and the kids too
Shawty left a letter on the couch
Saying you can have the house
She's in love with him and they're moving down south
What would you do? (What would you do?)
'Cause Shawty playing games with you while you're at work
She been hitting you where it hurts
Left you for another dude, that's gotta hurt
When you know you really don't deserve it
What would you do? (What would you do?)
'Cause the kids don't understand
That their mother left you for another man
Flip that around, you know that's what we do
We tell them that we love 'em but our hearts ain't true

Imagine if she crushed dudes like you crushed chicks
(Imagine that)
Have a starting five and your position was the bench
(Imagine that)
Busy when you call, don't return your messages
(Imagine that)
Ball 'til she fall while you taking care of kids
(Oh, imagine that)
Imagine if she don't wanna tell you where she been
(Imagine that)
Said she hanging with her girls but she hanging out with him
(Oh, imagine that)
Imagine if everything that I said ain't true
And she's home alone waiting for you, oh, yeah
You know, put yourself in her shoes
You gotta learn to treat her right
Right, oh yeah
He gotta treat you right, babe, huh
Imagine that, oh, oh
(Imagine that)
Can you imagine that?
(Imagine that, oh, imagine that)
'Cause y'all know what I'm talking about
(Imagine that)

Imagine if she crushed dudes like you crushed chicks
(Imagine that)
Have a starting five and your position was the bench
(Oh, imagine that)
Busy when you call, don't return your messages
(Imagine that)
Ball 'til she fall while you taking care of kids
(Imagine that)
Imagine if she don't wanna tell you where she been
Said she hanging with her girls but she hanging out with him
You don't wanna imagine thatEmbed
