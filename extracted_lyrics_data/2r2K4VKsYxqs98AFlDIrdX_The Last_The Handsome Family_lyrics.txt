2 ContributorsThe Last Lyrics
When you're too old to hit the timbers
But you still remember the sound of the planks
When the snow's deep in mid-December
You think of September and a girl you once knew

Well, you're too tired to sleep
And you're too old to think
So you pour another drink
And you swear this one's the last

Well, you're too tired to sleep
And you're too old to think
So you pour another drink
And you swear this one's the last

When the moon shines in your window and you hear the wind blow
And you're awake with the past
Well, the moon, she's bright and yellow
And the phone says hello but you want to put it down

Well, you're too tired to sleep
And you're too old to think
So you pour another drink
And you swear this one's the last
You might also like
And you swear this one's the last
And you swear this one's the lastEmbed
