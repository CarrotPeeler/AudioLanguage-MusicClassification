6 ContributorsAnkle Injuries LyricsFujiya, Miyagi (x26)
As-a pretty
As-a the bend
Lowercase letter S
Spray painted red
It's spray painted red
Yeah, your little arms
Swing on monkey bars
In search of applause
Like pixelated scraps of jazz mags in your head
Lights
Like pixelated scraps of jazz mags in your head
Lights
A career
Littered with, ankle injuries
In the mid to late 1980s
As-a pretty
As-a the bend
Lowercase letter S
Like pixelated scraps of jazz mags in your head
Lights
Like pixelated scraps of jazz mags in your head

Belisha beacons
Next to zebra crossings
My eight year old legs, stick to leatherette
Seat coverings
Watching
Belisha beacons
Through transparent things
Like pixelated scraps of jazz mags in your head
Lights
Like pixelated scraps of jazz mags in your head
Lights
Fujiya, Miyagi (x34)
