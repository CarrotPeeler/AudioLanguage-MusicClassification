6 ContributorsSweet Nothing Lyrics
The rain starts falling, when you're calling me
Why can't you see?
I'm diving underwater just to breathe

And I'm feeling lonely
I'm feeling blue
Won't you please give me something?
I don't believe in your sweet nothing

I feel your arms around me
You say you feel the love
But oh, I feel alone
You think you understand me but
I don't even understand me at all
I feel alone

London living, nothing comes for free
Why can't you see?
Time won't heal it, just stand still for me

And I'm feeling lonely
I'm feeling blue
Won't you please give me something?
'Cause I don't believe in your sweet nothing
You might also like
I feel your arms around me
You say you feel the love
But oh, I feel alone
You think you understand me but
I don't even understand me at all
I feel alone

I feel your arms around me
You say you feel the love
But oh, I feel alone
You think you understand me but
I don't even understand me at all
I feel aloneEmbed
