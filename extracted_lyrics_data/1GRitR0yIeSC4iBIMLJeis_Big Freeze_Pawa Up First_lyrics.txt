9 ContributorsDanny Myers vs. B. Dot Lyrics
First of all, I need you to go get me some chips and bring my change back. Go bring my change back ‘cause you gon’ never get my shit back
Yo, I put the beam on these self-righteous niggas, fuck B. Dot
You’ll think this nigga change his name the way that he’ll see (C) dots
Nah, fuck these gun bars, I ain’t come here to spark this nigga
When you’re in front of a false prophet, you’re supposed to talk to niggas
Don’t you roll with Brother Polight, an ignorant nigga that promotes polygamy?
How you gon’ lead us when you’re a slave to another man’s bigotry?
Peep the imagery, a fake nigga posing as a dear leader
Versus Black Jesus that can turn the water to sangria
You don’t want it with these bars, you don’t want it with these hands either
I bet he’ll break up after the first land like Pangaea
You come across as a social political activist
But you’re just usin' raps to tap into niggas’ pockets like Aktive is
I ain’t gon’ lie, that the shit you be talking sound good, you be preachin', Dot
But I brainstormed under my mental umbrella, you be reaching, Dot
You try to force feed us your views on right and wrong through writin' songs
But on October, Reecee went to the Million Man March and you didn’t ride along
See this first round, I’ll counteract the key to your plan
But by the third, I (eye) put one in your pineal gland
You battled Fiji, Stricc, a freestyle Daylyt, now you’re facin' D. Myers
You finally stepped up to a plus, now you’ll see where B mind is (minus)
Your neck, that’s just something for me to hack at
For these Dead Presidents, I’ll leave this preacher’s head in a backpack
You want this crown of the West, here nigga, put on both of my shoes
You ever been to New York in front of a thousand niggas hopin' you lose?
You ever defended this coast to the point you let a gat blast?
It’s funny you talkin' all this slave shit, but I’m the one talkin' the backlash
I got on a Dallas Stars hockey jacket, banana clip tucked, I’m ‘bout to juhgg his ass
You’ll see the crescent moon come from under the Star like the Muslim flag
Bar God!
I laid the blueprint for the west, but he is an offender clearly
This gun is the schematics to leave any nigga injured near (engineer) me
You can’t even trust the niggas that follow you, that’s what Jesus apostles proved
I’m over top of you, Aristotle view
The chopper fused his molecules with fossil fuels
I’m confused, it’s not for views, Let’s rationalize, B
Any time you’re writing God, you’re supposed to capitalize G
Sonic Soundwaveus gave me game
He said, “Nigga, fuck a metaphor”
Now I’m in the hood riding with a Panther like Skeletor
Charles Burnley, I ain’t want to get these guns involved
But if I meet you at the 'Crossroads', your nephew will be missing his Uncle Charles
They’re crazy if they think I ain’t a legend, they even use my age as reference
This is facial recognition, technology on an ancient weapon
It’ll give his chin a new identity like a Asian wedding
I won’t come at you with a mob of niggas, it’ll be me, two, or just three
In case them cells see us (Celsius), you got to keep a small circle to a degree
And even though he already in the ground with this shit
This wack MC got another two rounds of this shit
Yikes!
You might also like
Black African Power, but I see all skin folk ain’t your kinfolk
And by the looks of things current, see it’s all about currency
These mental slaves want me to pain, but these chains in my brain been broke
I came in this game for change, look Danny, I knew what I was in for
Giving up this type info
I knew these lames want to tear down my frame, but as long as they saw my picture, that’s really all I was picked for
Now these rounds is a breath of fresh air like Mentos
After me, they’ll be no others to do what I did though
I broke bread with sinners, had dinners with men, toast
Bragged, boast about whose toast shot men most
I said fuck all that jargon, I’m not here to trade bars and bargain with politicians just to win votes
This arc from his new covenant been dope from the get go
But the Bar God gon’ try to flood us with stories, all mythos
Well tell him I’m Christ-like, meaning I walk right on water, everything come out that pen floats
I’ve been dope, before the battle with Fiji or Stricc, bro
My people see me as the reincarnation of the pharaoh, utmost, running out this hit so
I see you niggas don’t read the glyps though
But I went back, did the research, delved in feet first
Read scripts low then brought you the cliff notes
Planting seeds in your mind, even if you don’t find what I spit dope
That’s fine, I sense the shit, so it’s photosynthesis how son shine and we get growth
Look what I get though, all this hate, but wait, heavy is the crown when you’re trying to uplift though
It’s obvious, I got to go against my opposite to know the diametrical compliment my wit, bro
So this is God in the flesh vs. this demigod with little to no theological info
I mean the brother that don’t fuck around versus the well-known nympho
I’m intellectual, you’re electrical, but let’s not compare the type
Yeah, we’re both fire, but Myers, it’s different degrees and we don’t seem to fare in height
Let’s be clear tonight, for starts, it’s nothing I’m ruling out
Nigga, I don’t give a fuck nor care, I’ll line a nigga up, it’s March, it’s right that we duke it out
Now they’re gon’ hoot and shout as you jump around this stage and move about
But please don’t talk about guns, you got too many daughters and sons to be pulling out
But we can shoot it out, you know, take ten steps and draw, I’m illustrating how we can duel it out
I’m a landlord with the pistol, I’m evicting these bullets, they’re moving out
And for the record, I’m well-versed and I got hooks, Kareem Abdul your mouth
You’re talking sweet, I’m digging deep to get to the bottom of it, pulling that root canal
I immersed out of the waters like an evolutionary amphibian
Climbing the ladder of battle rap in cognitive dissonance
Got the comp dissing him
All ‘cause I washed Fiji, went strict on Stricc, then got Lyt out of nowhere, Aunt Vivian
I’m positioning myself to be amongst the elites with the sentences
I got knowledge, wordplay, punches, angles, I’m too deep, you can’t compete with this kingmanship
I’ve been peeped through his feminine, I was just waiting and
Boom, you start surfing another wave, tryna speak on his penmanship
Making allegations, then have to retract your statements when you couldn’t make it legitimate
How ridiculous
You in these battle rap groups sharing private information for validation, dry snitching, blowing up a mean spot
All these gun bars, huh? You’re shooting this and shooting that
Nigga, the only thing you snap was a screenshot
We done figured you out, Danny, but we figured you figured this out too, you know
You be investigating, I’m sure you know me, nigga
But you remind me of my favorite gun, always trying to snub somebody, you nosy nigga
I bet you wished you can , nigga
So you can stand right here and yell “time” in the middle of my rhymes so I don’t OD, nigga
But this ain’t AHAT, these the BattleGroundz where I play at
You cased the East, they charged you fiends, and you already shown that you pay that
Did you really believe you gon’ get Rex 12K back?
My nigga, if it’s all WWE, you wouldn’t say that
We know you’re not macho, man, you wasn’t gonna run up on Randy like a savage and spray that
You could save that, ‘cause on the up and up, how you would expect brothers on the under to take that?
Like you was gonna leave him stone cold, laid flat
You need a coffin, a coroner, you have nothing in your arsenal, you’re out of your league
All this theatrics outside of the ring and you’re still not the ultimate warrior
Pardon if I’m boring ya, what, y’all tired of hearing how he gave them K’s to Rex?
But he’s supposed to be from the West and he paid them checks
Look, I know we talk about it religiously
I just figured he Muslim the way he kneeled to the East to pay respects
But it’s on to the next shit on your checklist
“New York is biased”, why, ‘cause Nunu called time, you wasn’t spitting your best shit
Don’t front and cover up that fact, I’m getting the vibe, magazines for whoever subscribed to that East vs. West shit
I’m like a mad scientist with that tec grip, I’ll murk this cat
Kneel to Christ mercy when I work this strap
I’ll bomb on his bitch, tell B.o.B. that’s the only time we’ll see a earth that’s flat
It could be you and six of your brethren, I’ll drive through, work the weapon
Yeah, you squares can rhyme, but it would be more ish if I have to circle seven
You’ll get smacked mentioning my name with a PG reference
I’m proven going over and around them grounds is the only time you’ll find me PG stepping
I keep a Wesson, went on The War Report them I’m supposed to report for war
They had all these niggas I never heard before
Local NYC PG’s calling up from the cornerstore
“Yo son, when you gon’ get on Smack?”, I said when one of them vets want to collide with the rookie
I was close to the edge feeling like all these heads was trying to push me
So I’ll go to New York, not to battle, but to let it rattle on one of these snakes from the line like “try me, pussy”
I’ll shoot up that whole PG class like I was tired of bullies
And after that, Smack wouldn’t provide me fully
It’ll be just like this lame’s name, well let me explain, after that homicide, the DA in NY be the only guy trying to book me
I’m standing over my own dead body, while onlookers have stale faces
The streetlights above reflect the light off the shell cases
I don’t know what quite happened, the sight’s madness
Ambulances, silence, the lights flashin' while my life’s passin'
Spirit outside my body, leaving for the journey
Two police officers hold back my wife while she reaching for the gurney
A black man had run up on me and popped the .9 off
In the midst of all this chaos, B Dot watches from the sidewalk
He’s wrecked with guilt, his conscience heavy, he’s grief stricken
He’s feeling responsible that I’ve become a street victim
Because he knows it was he who said, “Follow me, I say. This lead I take”
He got the key, but this combination let's him know even he not safe
See what I did there? It took the death of me to ascend destiny
Mind frame of a Dick Gregory in the mid-70s
So how is it fair a con (Farrakhan) can dare step to me?
But his tears resurrected me, it’s mysterious, G
My mind is not from the star system, I’m serious (Serius) B
Bullets are intended for us, or we die when a stray hit us
That’s why I keep my biscuit with me at all times like Dre Vishiss
I had a homeboy who was red flagging, he banged his hood, he had a bad rep
I had to witness Blood sacrifice soon as they gave his ass TEC (Aztec)
These streets are cold, look at the brain of pain we at
How ironic, they put together Dot and a maniac (Animaniac)
My brain react, cause he’s trying to put an end to Danny
I’ll hit niggas not even related to you with that extended family
Your bitch is trampy, but she could ride a dick, homie your ho is wild
She keeps her balance on the wood like Eddie Murphy in Golden Child
You gon’ label me a drug dealer cause I done served a little PCP?
Or I done put more 'Poison' in our community than BBD?
Well what you didn’t see, is when I bought that little kid a PS4
‘Cause for a dub rock, his mama sold his PS3
See, I regret some of this shit I done did, homie
Like buying food stamps from that smoker, then feeling guilty cause our kids hungry
Yes, I recognized God gave me the talent and respect
But I was learning about life’s checks and balances before I could balance a check
I already know where I’m headed, that road is just grim
You can’t put fear in a man whose soul is condemned
See I saw the job, but I was taught survive against all the odds
See the Bar God got the bars from God, but I’m barred from God
I used to stomp niggas out, that was the best way I punish
Now, I prefer the strap, over the kicks like XJ 900s
Pay less attention, he cold as ice, I’ma unthaw y’all glacier
I’m the antihero to the man y’all call ya'll savior
These bars will leave you crippled, now I must know what college you got this knowledge from, Charles, Xavier?
Don’t mind me, the shit I be on is beyond whatever B on
Even if he cold off the top, I’m the wrong nigga to free on (Freon)
You got to be conditioned to stay off the ground with this shit
This wack emcee got a whole another round of this shit
Yikes!
See this that shit that be igging me
When these punchline rappers want to get “conscious” ‘cause they’re dissing me
I find it interesting
So in your last battles, you only let your gat rattle in order to fit with battle rap’s imagery
Oh you’re taking the high road? But before it was the low with no dignity
That’s like shopping for shoes too small to use, you just took your soul out in order to fit in, literally
This is what y’all get to see, a Black Panther convict versus a backpacking hobbit with illiterate nonsense
All of a sudden, Danny Myers want to kick knowledge
Nigga, you’re not even a little bit conscious
You’re 36, still talking ‘bout blowing up, false flag, we can’t even consider you a legitimate bomb threat
That scheme you just did was all an interesting concept
Meanwhile, I got the intellect of Jay Elec, meshed with an intricate Nas depth
I’m Illmatic in battle rap fashion, fastened together by that same thread that attached these badges of honor to the sleeve on a fatigued jacket of a Vietnam vet
Your knowledge is no contest, what you know about the Annu, Akhi?
I’m talking deep research, don’t state the norm
I’ll have magis shoot arrows in a blazing storm
You’ve been warned, killing is what they adore
But you like to learn from some Aryan, so I gave my boys the cue and they'll form
Swing your swords? Nah, that’s more like knowledge in the clips when I shoot at you
Toasters in the holster, I had these rounds fleeing off the hip like a hula hoop
Pop at your medulla too, your whole team better scurry on
Nigga, my pops was a shooter too, it’s in my jeans for me to curry on
I come through walking dead like Mr. Wavy with that shotty on or had that nine probably
I’ll shoot your arm, leg, leg, arm, head, and get this God bodied
But nah, he mere mortal, if we combat, I’m diminishing dudes
Sock him, knock him off where he stand, now he swinging his head like he waiting on a finishing move
Listen, it ain’t about dissing the dude, I mean, Danny, you cold, B, you put on for LA, I’m glad that a few got to witness it
Oh you retiring? We wish you the best, but the truth is the West need new representatives
‘Cause you, Diz, Day, the triple D’s all keep it abreast in your respective position
But y’all make the West look suspicious
And you from “Writer’s Bloque”? Nigga, I’m from a rider’s block, that’s why we’re addressing shit different
You know what, I’m just stressing our difference, ‘cause here, we have a nigga from the hood that say he “not from no hood”
You know, straight out of South Central, a nerd with an attitude, another O’Shea Jackson, duke, naw this can’t be no good
You’re all in your battle raps gripping the snub, affectionate with your pistol, giving that four fifth a hug
But never once have I heard you utter a word on whether you Crip or you Blood
Nigga, what set is you from?
And don’t play me dumb, nigga, you know how it’s done
I need the head up, or your head up boxed in if you tell me “it’s none”
Nigga, what set is you from?
I’m not glorifying gangbanging for one
But at South Central, we all know the mental of the niggas that shit they got to get done
They put in work, may go to jail, and well that’s another brother neglecting his son
And a mother can’t protect for the young, so he get put on a set, that come with a rep with a gun
You know he got to be a real nigga, not a replica one
So they hit him with funds, a little work to get off, he can help with the mortgage
Besides, them guys from the other side might ride and want to give him a morgue trip
And funerals get expensive, momma couldn't afford it, she just got to support it
Her baby boy dialed in to the streets, and she can’t even call it
Now this is that “regular ghetto family portrait”, you understand why his vision is kinda important?
It’s uncanny, we should see this all in Danny, but the picture you’re painting is kinda distorted
But you’re the “Bar God”, so you figure niggas will probably ignore it
The “top dog” on the West can shuffle his deck, you pull the card
It’s “aw, I was that good kid in that mad city”, try to Kendrick Lamar it
Well that’s when we run up on your van with them cans and do ya like the Kendrick Lamar skit
Let that damn llama spray
Like, “oh you’re looking for Sherane, Danny? We need to know where your grandma stay
Get out the car before I snatch you out that motherfucker, andele”
The 40 clap, it’ll roll him back like the yoga mat, Namaste
Let’s be honest, hey, Uncle Red said, “you should leave the streets alone, go ‘head and battle rap”
Yet every time you battle rap, you tattle tat ‘bout how you handle packs and blasting packs, imagine that
The only reason we knew your talent is because you got detached from that
Now you use your talent to glorify drugs and violence, well that’s the same exact habitat
And what do y’all extract from that?
Perhaps, it’s that lil’ Daniel was never found where the action at
You wanted to swim with the sharks, but couldn’t play the part, you had to go fish, you couldn’t match with that
Now using acrobat, trying to flip all these lines and shit ‘bout how you supply the bricks and light up the block like the Gaza strip
But you never shared blood with the Bloods or c-walked in stride with Crips
You lying prick, either you got put off the set ‘cause you wouldn’t die for shit
Or you was never out, always in the house on the couch eating pie with clips
What side is it?
I mean you designed this shit, so you ought to decide the shit
You claim we have the same ideologies, but I could tell by your rhyming schemes which god you with
‘Cause you provide the script, claim you was inspired, all divine and shit
But that’s ambiguous language which is anguish for your disciples that have to decipher with
Well good thing I’m involved with enlightenment, ain’t no mental enslaving him
See, you’re the personification of religion, you know, Gods always behaving like the people who created them
Well this explains it then, this deity of yourself you created is not made up in the image which relates to him
Just like the authors in the Bible, you went around writing about the surroundings and different cultures you was engaging in
Well B Dot, always mentioning the Bible, what you saying then?
I’m saying keep your eyes open, or a tre in him
We just can’t believe in a god because he hides behind an amazing pen
What the fuck can you say to win?

You want to know what’s killing black men?
It’s not the system, racism, gang violence, and all this black on black
Take a look closer, it’s this very culture we call battle rap
This that one place we entertain talkin' about clappin' gats
I could disrespect your black mother, and black woman, and they all gon’ laugh at that
I could ask them for 20 dollars a piece to build a business within our habitat
And they’re all gon’ scoff at me, like “Nigga, I could get a sack with that.”
Your whole angle is elevatin' the black conscience
Yet you participate in this nonsense
Is this your way of infiltratin' our ignorant mind so we can make progress?
Stop it, I don’t feel your skill is threat
I’ll give Creflo Dollar 65 from the mil' then jet
Bar God!
How the fuck did you think you could outflow me?
My verbal ninjitsu is not a game, this is something you should know, B (Shinobi)
Lowkey, since ’03, I moved weight a couple of ways
It’s like the scale is embedded in me, I call it stuck in my ways (weighs)
My fellow African, before Smack came to LA, I was trafficking (Traffic'ing)
But at the same time, I can tell you was buried under the Vatican
I beat niggas to a Pulp, no Fiction within my diction
I’ll send you to the merciful with a pair of scopes (para scopes) like the submersible
God level, don’t let that be a deterrent
Even though that was a submarine bar, my flow is above the current
Nigga, I still keep my hammer raised
Cause I ain’t seen Justice since that nigga got his head blown on Janet braids
How Poetic, B. Dot got all these bars and he still suck
You can’t break down a man who can deconstruct your buildups
I talk real stuff with Five Percenters, Muslims, Christians, this is what the game be
Religion is just a bunch of different branches that lead to the same tree
But it pains me you scrutinize niggas who bang they Llamas
You talk all this political shit like your last name Obama
Well remember that kid I sent to the store? That’s symbolic of you
Cause niggas never bring us the change they promised
Bar God!
Nigga, how can I not be mean? I’m from a different Creed
That’s why I should beat yo' ass to the Rocky theme
We need to be gettin' ready for martial law for this revolution, they gon’ try to fuck with us
But soon as we try to rise, well, (Roswell) get ready for the military, cover up
I left bodies in that debris field, nigga, I’m past nice
You’re dealin' with a man who possesses unseen rounds that can crash sites
But fuck the gray area, sometimes, we got to direct the shot
In order for my strap to complete the entire picture, it must connect the Dot
I promise the type of beef we in gon’ get the morgue’s attention
What happens after I get his length, width, and height, it’s only for the four to mention (fourth dimension)
You bring those brothers with you to gas you and to help the crowd decide
They’re instrumental to your lyrics, that’s why they on B side
For the record, you ain’t met no niggas ill as me
You ain’t got to be associated with the Wu-Tang Clan to see a Killer, B(ee)
The steel will be tucked, wrong nigga to go to war with
I’ll expose his chest behind the magazine like Halle Berry in Swordfish
The four fifth will split him, he on the ground with this shit
Thank the lord he ain’t got another round of this shit
Yikes!

Peace to my sisters that be watching my battles and figure me consciously gifted
Plus I’m handsome, so you know they’re showing the man some interest
I love all my queens, but I wear this ring every battle, please don’t act like you missed it
See I won’t do like this dipshit, you know, pursue you for sex so persistent
Make you a jump off or mistress
Cradle little life, now make you my wife, and then when you ask about marriage, dismiss it?
Nah, I inherit these merits from the ancestors, I’m different
I’m bring back the black family structure when it’s apparent that parents uplifted
Now I ain’t preaching no scriptures, look Danny, I’m far from perfect
I can’t even speak to the distance, I’m just a work in progress
Trying to reach my pinnacle, and for battle rap, I got minimal interest
But this is a topic at hand that needs to have the top twist off of the can
I’m reaching and exposing your flaws
You’re my dog and all, but boy, I’m ‘bout to make you a man
This some shit I don’t think you understand
Maybe I’m the brother that can bring it to life
I mean I exposed the darkness in niggas, I did it with Fiji, Stricc, and we all saw how I brought it to Lyt
This is about who’s wrong and who’s right, I mean, we’re sort of alike
Both glued from the tube watching their family feud, but you amused, I’m more confused, like “who ordered this fight”
You know, mommy submissive, daddy dismissive, staying out on that corner all night
Daddy the head of the household, but mommy got to keep her mouth closed
She give an opinion, it might result to the right
But tonight, I’m restoring the pride
‘Cause that European religion got you niggas caught in the hype
They gave you a book of stories about men of glory and you bought the shit, right?
Well why is there no female deity supporting your Christ?
You know, the Father, Son, Holy Spirit, you may not hear it, but your daughters just might
Aw nigga, we gon’ go there tonight
I’m not one to judge, but where was the gloves, nowhere in sight?
Ten kids, all these baby mamas, come on Danny Myers, you know that ain’t right
But I notice your type, you’s a fiend, you paid to get on Smack
So it all makes sense how you can’t keep control of your pipe
But these are the days of our lives, it all ties into religion in the way it’s contrived
You treat the black woman like a side bitch, well ‘cause you was taught she came from your side
And my nigga, that’s alright, we got to debate the contention
I’m certain I’m the right surgeon to make this incision
I’m splitting the part of your brain that has that Eurocentric dimension
They’re Willie Lynched them, really convinced them that the black woman is bitches
See that white man is historically wicked, but if you morally get it, that’s when the story get twisted
They got you plugged to the matrix, it’s basic, but you’re ignoring the glitches
Like in the beginning was The Word, and the word is God, that’s how it go in the scriptures
But when them agent rolling to get you, you got to do like Neo and go see your oracle
Oh you know she a sister, she how the white man just did ya?
He hid God in plain sight ‘cause he knew you would ignore the enigma
He can steal frames from the brain ‘cause he knew you ain’t gon’ pause and analyze the steel frames as he motions the picture
My nigga, I’ve been chosen to get ya
The black woman is God, Danny, I’m here to breathe life into that dead message
‘Cause you’s a fuck boy that just like to fuck, boy, you went around making bed messes
You find women you like, you rock, then roll out, Led Zeppelin
You damaged the box, knocked it up, and don’t care about the deliveries, no wonder why you got fed exes
I got to stress this, ‘cause you missed the lessons taught by the ancestors
We put our women on the throne, that’s the definition for the name that explains who our set is
I hope y’all catch this, they created an Adam and Eve to make y’all believe that a woman was to blame to why we’re deceived, the fuck why you’re feeling that for?
I can’t fathom an Adam when every picture I’ve seen, he’s depicted to be with a bellybutton, so did he have an umbilical cord?
Did he come from the womb or not? Don’t ask why I’m getting biblical for
It’s all suitable, it ties into the root of you and it explains why you treat women like whores
See Danny, you’re exactly the nigga I figured you for
Just another battle rap nigga that want to get in this ring and spit about war
But won’t teach your children about stacking and building, group economics, or how to be an entrepreneur
As far as battle rap, aw nigga, you got it, for sure
But here’s the question, are you selling a product or are you just a product in store?
See these are topics we got to explore
You say you love this culture, that kind of shit don’t even matter no more
You got all these battles galore
Your 36 still not running your own league, these the things I’m mad at you for
Perhaps we should travel some more
Back to the past where blacks were treated like cattle
Observe how the slave master wanted us to fuck and breed so we can push our seeds through that revolving door
You’re the 2016 version of that, encore
Keeping up with the dumb shit, I ain’t even trying to uplift
I’m just trying to differentiate so the queens know who to date and who not to fuck with
Before they get stuck with a nigga like you that will load their boat and jump ship
Never heard you once spit about your kids, how you hold them close, but you’ll brag and boast about that pump grip
Nigga, that’s punk shit, how we gon’ raise up these daughter if we’re not praising their mamas?
Nigga, the black family going through genocide, and Danny, all bullshit aside, you engage in that slaughter
You’re just a big fucking kid, the way you behave, I’m amazed you’re a father, but the universe creates it in authors
And the last page gon’ have your daughters introducing Danny to a brand new daddy, and you can’t escape from the karma
And we won’t debate any longer, as far as battle rap, I’m done with that
Unless I have a revelation, tell Th3 Saga that will be the only situation where a god is coming backEmbed
