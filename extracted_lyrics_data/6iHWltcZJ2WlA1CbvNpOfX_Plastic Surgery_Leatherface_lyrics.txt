1 ContributorPlastic Surgery LyricsThat day you said you sent a letter to me never got it anyway
Playing that guilt trip game some are won't to do
Now I lie awake with tequila sunrise
Feeling like shit surprise surprise by your lack of impiety
There's really never been a daydream that didn't leave me smiling
And as I get old all I see makes less sense to me
There's really never been a daydream that didn't leave me smiling
There's never been a dream a wet dream left me for him
There's something plastic surgery about this thing called a cd
Something status quo bout a rolled up one pound note
There's something your big false teeth do say
You never brushed them anyway
There's something credit note bout the age that you can vote
That day you said you sent a letter to me
I think I got it but I threw it away
Something squeaky clean oh it makes me
There's really never been a daydream that didn't leave me smiling
And as I get old all I see makes less sense to me
There's really never been a daydream that didn't leave me smiling
There's never been a dream more than a dream left me for himYou might also likeEmbed
