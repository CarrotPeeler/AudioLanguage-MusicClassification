2 ContributorsBlood of Vengeance LyricsAnd was not man created from the blood of Dagon
Commander of the hordes of the Old Ones?
Does not man possess in his spirit
The sees of rebellion against the Old Ones?
And the blood of man is the Blood of Vengeance
And the blood of man is the Spirit of Vengeance
And the power of man is the Power of the Old Ones
And this is the Covenant for, lo
The Old Ones possess the sign
By which the powers of the Old Ones are turned back
But man possesses the sign
And the number
And the shape
To summon the blood of his parents
And this is the Covenant created by the Old Ones
From the blood of the Old Ones
Man is the key by which the gate of Iak Sakkak may be flung wide
By which the Old Ones Seek their blood of VengeanceYou might also likeEmbed
