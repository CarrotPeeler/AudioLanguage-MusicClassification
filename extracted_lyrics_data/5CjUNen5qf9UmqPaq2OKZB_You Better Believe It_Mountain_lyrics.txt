1 ContributorYou Better Believe It LyricsThat I do love you
And my love is true
Don't go around with a doubt in your mind
You know, baby, I'm not the cheatin' kind because
Whoa... oh... whoa... you'd better believe it, baby
(You'd better believe it)
Somebody's been lyin'
Because I've been so true
Now stop your cryin'
And your sobbing too
You'll feel so much better when you do
You know, baby, there's no one else but you because
Whoa... oh... whoa... you'd better believe it, baby
(You'd better believe it)
How could you let them get under your skin
The story you heard was just a big lie
I know within my heart I've committed no sin
So baby, there's no reason to cry
Whoa... whoa... yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I know, I know, I know, baby, you'd better believe it, yeah, yeah
(You'd better believe it)
Baby
Believe it, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(You'd better believe it) Just put a little trust in me, baby
(You'd better believe it) I'll show you that I care, ooh
(You'd better believe it)You might also likeEmbed
