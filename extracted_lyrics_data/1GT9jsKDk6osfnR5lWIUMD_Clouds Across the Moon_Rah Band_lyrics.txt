10 ContributorsClouds Across The Moon Lyrics
"Good evening, this is the intergalactic operator. Can I help you?"
"Yes. I'm trying to reach Flight Commander P. R. Johnson, on Mars, Flight 2-4-7."
"Very well, hold on please. You're through!"
"Thank you, operator!"

Hi, darlin', how you doin'?
Hey, baby, were you sleeping?
Oh, I'm sorry, but I've been really missing you
Hi, darlin', how's the weather?
Say, baby, is that cold better now?
Oh, I'm sorry, is there someone there with you?

Oh, since you went away, there's nothing goin' right!
I just can't sleep alone at night
I'm not ashamed to say I badly need a friend
Or it's the end

Now, when I look at the clouds across the moon
Here in the night, I just hope and pray that soon
Oh, baby, you'll hurry home to me

Hi, darlin', the kids say they love you
Hey, baby, is everything fine with you?
Please forgive me, but I'm trying not to cry
You might also like
Oh, I've had a million different offers on the phone
But I just stay right here at home
I don't think that I can take it anymore
This crazy war

Now, when I look at the clouds across the moon
Here in the night, I just hope and pray that soon
Oh, darling, you'll hurry home to me

"I'm sorry to interrupt your conversation, but we are experiencing violent storm conditions in the asteroid belt at this time. We may lose this valuable deep-space communication link. Please, be as brief as possible. Thank you."

Oh, since you went away, there's nothing goin' right!
I just can't sleep alone at night
I'm not ashamed to say I badly need a friend
Or it's- it's-

"Hello? Hello, operator?"
" Yes, we seem to have lost the connection! Could you try again please?"
-"I'm sorry, but I'm afraid we've lost contact with Mars 2-4-7 at this time."
CHORUS repeat 3 times WHILE SAYING:
"OK. Thank you very much...
I'll... I'll try again next year... next year... next year... next year..."
