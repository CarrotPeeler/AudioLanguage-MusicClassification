6 ContributorsClementine LyricsIn a cavern, down by a canyon
Excavation' for a mine
A-there lived a miner from North Carolina
And his daughter chubby Clementine
An' every mornin', hey, just about dawnin'
A when the sun began to shine
You know she would rouse up, wake all a them cows up
And walk 'em down to her daddy's mine
She took the foot bridge way 'cross the water
Though she weighed two-ninety-nine
The old bridge trembled and disassembled
Oops, dumped her into the foamy brine
Hey, crackle like thunder, you know she went under
Blowin' bubbles down the line
Hey, I'm no swimmer but were she slimmer
I might've saved that Clementine
Hey, broke the record way under water
I thought that she was doin' fine
I wasn't nervous until the service
That they held for Clementine
Hey, you sailor way out in your whaler
With a harpoon, your trusty line
If she shows now, yeah, there she blows now
It just may be chunky Clementine
One more time
Oh my darlin', oh my darlin'
Oh my darlin', oh my darlin'
Oh my darlin' sweet Clementine
You may be gone but you're not forgotten
Fare thee well, so long Clementine, byeYou might also likeEmbed
