You could come over
You could commit
You could commit
You could come over
You could come over
You could submit…
Talking to you – Talking to you
Talking to you – I’m talking to you
No time to waist, get in get out
No extra weight to bring us down
Plastic tape full of love
In between
Glassine heart, powder soul
Leather dream
Flashing lights, sirens call
Out to me
Flashing lights, sirens call
I walk beside you
I walk beside you
I hold you near
I’ll hold you near
You might also likeI’ll stand beside you
I’ll stand beside you
You’ll have no fear
I’ll walk beside you
I’ll walk beside you
I’ll hold you near
I’ll hold you near
I’ll walk beside you
I’ll walk beside you
I’ll hold you near
I’ll hold you near
Just hope that no one’s watching me
When we connect and start to breathe
Plastic tape full of love
In between
Glassine heart, powder soul
Leather dream
Flashing lights, sirens call
Out to me
Flashing lights, sirens callEmbed
