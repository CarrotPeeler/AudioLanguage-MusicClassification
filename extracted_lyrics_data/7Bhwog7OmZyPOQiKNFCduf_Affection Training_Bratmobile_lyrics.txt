3 ContributorsAffection Training Lyrics
This is daytime TV yeah, yeah
There's a seat reserved just for you
I can never sleep, but I'm brain-dead
Branded with a piece of you

Oh no!
There's no other way
True love at the price of your soul
Insatiable, I can't get me no, no

I don't like you any more
Than the other boys sold in this store
What if I was honest with you?
Would that make you like me, like you?

I don't, I don't know
I don't know what to do
I stopped using my ears, so I watch you

He still asks about my job
I think that it fascinates him
We all need affection training
So how can I get you out of here?
You might also like
He, she
He's a she
He's a she that don't exist
Well what do you mean you knew about it?

I learned somewhere that living with dudes
Means you pick up their wet towels
Dirty underwear and find their
Ignorance cute somehow

I ain't, I ain't done
"I ain't never done nothing"
See Mr. Whatever describe himself

It's frightening to feel worthless
In the eyes of worthlessness
My fear has nowhere left to go
Impossible, I can't get me, no no

All the girls are fighting over
The dumbest boys who run this town
I watch myself get watched like TV
But I'd rather run you down1Embed
