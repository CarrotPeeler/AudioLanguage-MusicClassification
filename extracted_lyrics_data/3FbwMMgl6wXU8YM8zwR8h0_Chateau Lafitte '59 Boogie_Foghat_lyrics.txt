Oh what a night, sure had a real good time
Oh what a night, sure had a real good time
You drink whiskey, I'll drink cheap red wine
My head started spinnin', eyes began to roll
My head started spinnin', eyes began to roll
Crazy fool, shoulda listened to what I've been told
But I'm rollin', all night long - Rollin', all night long
Rollin', all night long - Just another drink and I'll be gone, gone, gone
Look at old Charlie, standin' by a dollar bill
Look at old Charlie, standin' by a dollar bill, mm hmm
It may look good, but it sure ain't no cheap thrill
So I'm rollin', all night long, Rollin', all night long
Rollin', all night long, Just another drink and I'll be gone, gone, gone
Well I'm gone!
{Rod - Slide Solo}
Whoo!
My head started spinnin', eyes began to roll
My head started spinnin', eyes began to roll, shouldn't do that, shouldn't do that, Crazy fool, I drank too much alcohol.That's alright!
