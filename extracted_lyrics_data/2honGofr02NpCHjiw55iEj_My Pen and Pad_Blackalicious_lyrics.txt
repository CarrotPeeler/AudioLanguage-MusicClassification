4 ContributorsMy Pen and Pad Lyrics
Here we go...here we go...

Back on the journey again, tool is the pad and the pen
Cool is the fan as the wind, soothin' you after I send
True innervision risen and driven and givin' you MY
Isms of intuition while niggas is livin' a LIE
Syllables spill and I fly, high as the pinnacle rhyme
Not to belittle a fool, but try to get into you my -
Lyrics inherited from awareness somewhere in the sky
Clearly you'll give 'em merit and cherish 'em better wit' time
There is none ever and on like rivers, so clever I shine
Verbal ambassador travel in this endeavor of mine
Never a anti-gangster, the ghetto is still in the mind
If I was, not rappin', a nigga might be up inside
All of your terraces, stealin' wallets and necklaces, I
Give hella gratefulness for the blessin' to share this and fly
Everywhere people outside the culture now try to deFINE
What it is, but it is MINE, such it is, love with it BLIND
Vision but no division is vivid we livin' inside
Vicious vindictive and mental prisons from within the mind
Sit and I find stillness from minutes is written the RHYME
Gettin' you smitten wit' it, particularly if you're a prime
Listener, listen up, twist it up like the lyrics was lime
Vintage is instant, so give it up when you hear it recited
At attention, relievin' tension and bendin' yo' spine
Sendin' you signals to get yo' internal system aligned
Lyrical pinnacle, situation is critical
Syllable after syllable, give it to you, deliver you my -
Intervals, sendin' you through dimensions you didn't know
Hidden in you, within you, when you get in the begin into it
Sentiments internets, couldn't send you yet signals you get
Rippin' through skin and through tissue, fix you elixirs that MIGHT -
(lift your peripheral vision, the mystical wisdom that tends
To go into the infinite system of livin' and this is the ending
As well as beginning of the Gift and his prime)
Mission the bliss is divine, Christen it, isn't it fine?
Listen and dissin' it, that's the incident innocent
Men and women hit, lyrics is killin' niggas, they shiverin'
The predicament's thick, and it split the wig of the ignorant lyricist, puttin' fear in their spirit...
Yo, that's my time!
