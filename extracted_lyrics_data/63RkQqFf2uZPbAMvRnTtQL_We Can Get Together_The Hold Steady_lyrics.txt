16 ContributorsWe Can Get Together Lyrics
She played "Heaven Isn't Happening"
She played "Heaven Is a Truck"
She said Heavenly was cool
I think they were from Oxford
I only had one single
It was a song about a pure and simple love

There's a girl on Heaven Hill
I come up to her cabin still
She said Hüsker Dü got huge, but they started in St. Paul
Do you remember "Makes No Sense At All"?

And heaven is the whole of the heart
And paradise is by the dashboard light
Utopia's a band, they sang "Love Is the Answer,"
And I think they're probably right

Let it shine down on us all
Let it warm us from within
He wasn't just the drummer
He was the singer's younger brother
I still spin that single, but it don't sound that simple
Let it shine down on us all
Let it warm us from within
He wasn't just the drummer
He was someone's little brother
I still spin that single, but it don't sound that simple anymore

Heaven is whenever we can get together
Sit down on your floor, and listen to your records
Heaven is whenever we can get together
Lock your bedroom door, and listen to your records
Heaven is whenever we can get together
Heaven is wheneverEmbed
