6 ContributorsMe And My Horses Lyrics
Me and my horses
Traveling to places
Past the city walls
Down the city roads
Thought I was close
To the place where I rose

Me and my first date
We give and we take
We evaluate
We negotiate
We communicate
Thought I was late
When I passed through the gate
This feeling I hate, you know
Whenever you meant to go

Back home
Like houses
Like home
Like leaving
Like shoes
Like running
Like fast
Like horses
Like drums
Like pulses
Like heart
Like dancing
Like drowning with a stone
In your pocket
With a stone
Like probably
Like worry
Like possibly
Like maybe
Like maybe
Like maybe
Like maybe
Like maybe
Like maybe
Like maybe
Like maybe
Like maybe
Like maybe
Like maybe

My horse with a neigh
Selling cocaine
Wanna bring back
Summer's empire

My horse with a neigh
Selling cozy
Horse bring back
Summer's empireEmbed
