Back then to make you smile
To the end of the earth and back
To protect all that we had
Now it's done and I'm gone
But you're back here in my face

So why you wanna go kickstart the drama?
Now don't you know you can't break through my armour?
Just leave me alone, leave me alone
Just leave me alone, leave me alone
Kickstart the drama
Kickstart the drama
It's a little too late to want me now
It's dead and gone
'Cause the fact that you messed things up
It's your fault and that's real talk
Now I'm done with your song
'Cause the melody's all wrong

You might also likeNow I'll be the one that gets to not return your calls
And you'll be the one who gets to feel invisible
