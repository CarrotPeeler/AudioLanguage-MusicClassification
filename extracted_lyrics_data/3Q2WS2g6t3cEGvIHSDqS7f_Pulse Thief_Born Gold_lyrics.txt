2 ContributorsPulse Thief Lyrics
Euphoria's asleep
I took her timid pulse
Euphoria's asleep
Beneath clean sheets of snow

Euphoria's asleep
My body's trembling wax
Euphoria, you priest
Of barren wrists and arched backs

Because we aren't
No, we are
So let me graze you
With these wires
Till our pulses conspire
In the coda of modems
But we aren't
No, we are
Sure I know that
You're real and you're red
But I just don't have
The energy for it
You might also like
