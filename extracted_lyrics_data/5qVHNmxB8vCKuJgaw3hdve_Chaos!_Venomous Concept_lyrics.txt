1 ContributorChaos LyricsOpen your eyes to worldwide violence, copious shit talk, political bore
Idol rhetoric, violence licks its face with open sores
Politics aside, subject to its menticide
Social genocide, blinding chaos' eye
Commander in thief, hail to our freak
Little man, big war
Pick a war worth fighting for
Pick a war worth fighting for
Every day it's the same shit
Fail at will, we fought them
The ideals of humanity
Crushed in vanity
Social parasite, fuck off
Politics aside, subject to its menticide
Social genocide, blinding chaos' eye
Commander in thief, hail to our freak
Little man, big war
Pick a war worth fighting for
Pick a war worth fighting forYou might also likeEmbed
