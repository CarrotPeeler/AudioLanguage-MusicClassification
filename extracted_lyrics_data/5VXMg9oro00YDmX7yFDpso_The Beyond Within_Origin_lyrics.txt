3 ContributorsThe Beyond Within LyricsThe beyond with all our minds
Is ruling our, souls eternally
Unable to interpret the, ways we all think
Psychosis in humanity
Will not abate, while we still exist
Unable to interpret the reasons we live
Intervals of coherent thought die everyday
The beyond within
Brains evolving through time, die
Then are reborn, melt into one, one mind
Intuition breeds, seeds
That infultrate, minds still alive, Survive
Born of intrinsic might, Instinct far beyond our sight
Fighting the eternal fight – one thought
Intrude other mindless souls
Trespassing between the mold
Internal resistance bold – depress
Wandering lost in the winds
Some thoughts will never begin
Interrupt progress again – obtuse, obscurred
Intricate patterns, of thought and pain, evolve our ways
Fascinate our minds, with life and death, throughout our days
Merely existing, through change and, influence through time
Brilliant ignorance, and blindness, thoughts, in skewered lines

See beyond your own mind now revealing – our insight
The beyond within beyond all seeing – plunged in you
The beyond within the beyond within – comes to lifeEmbed
