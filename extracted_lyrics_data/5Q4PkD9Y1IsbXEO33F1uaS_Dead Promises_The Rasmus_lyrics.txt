4 ContributorsDead Promises LyricsThe break of dawn kills all the beauty
The dead of night is drifting away
Should I stay and welcome the day
Or should I follow the one
And hide from the sun
The ray of light cuts like a razor
The blazing fire burns in my eyes
The day reveals the dreadful betrayer
And his wicked mind
Hide from the sun
Hide from the sun
Hide from the sun
Dead promises
Paintings of the world so pure
Ancient prophecies
Remains of the worlds of cruel
The time has come
To hide from the sun
Like a rat I run to the darkness
The ray of night embraces my mind
Afraid to look back into the heartless
World of dust and blood
I'll hide from the sun
Hide from the sun
Hide from the sun

Paintings of the world so pure
Ancient prophecies
Remains of the worlds of cruel
The time has come
To hide from the sun
I know me better
I won't be as bitter
In my own heaven
I'll be gone forever
Won't fall back never
I won't crack ever
Won't look back never
Dead promises
Paintings of the world so pure
Ancient prophecies
Remains of the worlds of cruel
The time has come
Hide from the sunEmbed
