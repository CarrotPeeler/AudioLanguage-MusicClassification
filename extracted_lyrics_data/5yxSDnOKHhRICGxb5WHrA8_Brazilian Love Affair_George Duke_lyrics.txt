5 ContributorsBrazilian Love Affair Lyrics

In the morning
On the beach there
People gather
To meet the sunshine
With open arms
Reaching for heaven
With open hearts
And open minds

I found a lover
By the seaside
With sexy brown skin
And haunting eyes
Time keeps passing
But no one cares
Life for living
Is the thing there
Be yourself, be free


In Bahia
And in Rio
In Sao Paulo
In Brasilia
Sandy beaches, cooling breezes
Sexy women calling to you
You might also like
For you, ah, aha
Aha, aha
Aha, aha
Aha, aha
