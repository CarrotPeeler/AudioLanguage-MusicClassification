Survival
Survival of the fittest
Survival
I, uh, I gotta get with it
'Cause it ain't no joke (Ain't no joke) when a man is broke
Busted walking around broke
And it ain't no jive (Ain't no jive) trying to stay alive
Living from day to day, living now
Rent man says that the rent is due
My little baby needs a new pair of shoes
I'm just about to lose my mind
One step away from the bread line
Well, I'm trying to do the very best I can
Trying to make it on through
I don't know which way to turn
I don't know what to do.  Oooh, oooh, oooh
(Ay, ay, ay.)
Survival.  Oh, oh, oh, oh
(Survival of the fittest.)
Survival
I, well, well, I gotta get with it
'Cause it ain't no joke (Ain't no joke) when a man is broke
Busted walking around broke
And it ain't no jive (Ain't no jive) trying to stay alive
Living from day to day, living now

Looking for hope, I can't find any
First law of nature is the preservation of man
Looks like I'll have to do with anything I can
Hustle bustle, day in and day out
Can't even get a good night's sleep
I don't know how in the world
We're gonna make these ends meet.  Oh
(Ay, ay, ay.)
Survival.  Ay, yi, yi

Survival
I, uh, I gotta get with it
'Cause it ain't no joke (Ain't no joke) when a man is broke
Walking around with his hands in his pocket broke, busted
And it ain't no jive (Ain't no jive) trying to stay alive
Living from day to day, living now
Hustle bustle, can't quit it, gotta get it
