Today you talk about that time when your mind was really sore
Now I know why you have been thinking about the other side
You never thought that it would happen and now you have lost your pride
Going up going down, sometimes I feel the same way as you do
You feel to scream you feel to cry
Melancholy protection
You've got to move on
You are chanceless to find the warmth again
You are chanceless but can't forget what happened thenSee Millencolin LiveGet tickets as low as $117You might also likeEmbed
