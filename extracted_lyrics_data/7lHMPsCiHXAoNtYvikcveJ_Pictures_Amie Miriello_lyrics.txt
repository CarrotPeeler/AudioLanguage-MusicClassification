2 ContributorsPictures LyricsSuddenly again rambling on about it
You got your new found friends
And your new life, baby
Throw caution to the wind
Everyone knows you're not coming back again
Because you're so beyond
That seems as though I never knew you
Here and now I see right through you
What have we become?
Is it too late to turn around?
To leave it all behind you?
With your shadow it served you well
But I will still hold on to pictures
Of the way that we used to be
And the way that I knew you once before
(Knew you once before)
You had me from the start
Our love was like communion
At peace with who we are
And what we could be
Singing in your car
Singing lines from movies
You might also likeStaring in the dark
We were both so free
Things remind me of you lately
Looking back it drives me crazy
What have we become?
Is it too late to turn around?
To leave it all behind?
With your shadow it's served you well
But I will still hold on to pictures of
The way that we used to be
The way that I knew you
Running in circles
I'm talking to myself, oh
What have I become
Is it too late to turn around?
To leave it all behind you?
With your shadow it's served you well
But I will still hold on
To pictures of the way
That we used to be
The way that we used to be
The way that I knew you once beforeEmbed
