5 ContributorsBaby Dynamite LyricsWith a dream in her pocket
Flightticket in hand
She's going off to the crazy land
Green pastures - like blankets unfold
Out the door and down the hall
Crazy river, with a cold shiver
Into doop water she dives
She's got herself involved
And now it's evolved
Into interstellar overdrive
Well I know she's got a talent for finding me
When she happens to be in the vicinity
She'll be on the phone
When the dancin's done
Probably all alone
My baby dynamite - your lucky stars are out tonight
And your cards are on the table
All the odds are in your favour
Dynamite - heaven says you're doin' allright
With a heart that's shaped like a diamond
You've been cut for the assignment
Don't be a moth - hidin' pain
When your wings go up in flame
You might also likeMoney is a rocket - blow it skyhigh
The more you get - the more you fly
Green pastures that unfold
A future carved out of solid gold...
Found in a river - hidin' a treasure
Impossible to find
And your soul's sold to the payroll
While it's tryin' to have a good time
Stayin' up - walkin' around
Talkin' muscle & makin' sounds
Like baby dynamite - your lucky stars are out tonight
And your cards are on the table
All the odds are in your favour
Dynamite - heaven says you're doin' allright
With a heart that's shaped like a diamond
You've been cut for the assignmentEmbed
