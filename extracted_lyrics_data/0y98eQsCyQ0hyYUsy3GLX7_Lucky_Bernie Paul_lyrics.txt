3 ContributorsLucky LyricsStanding all alone in the dark
And there's no one round
Who could break my heart
In those lonely nights I saw you
But still there is no one round
To make this dream come true
I can't feel you
When I touch you
I can't see you
When I love you
I can't hold you
When I'm with you
But I feel that you're near
In dreams
I see your faceYou might also likeEmbed
