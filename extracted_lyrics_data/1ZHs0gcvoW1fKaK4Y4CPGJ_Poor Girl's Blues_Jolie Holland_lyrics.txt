That doesn't bother me at all
Maybe I'm a poor girl
But it doesn't bother me at all
When this world comes crashing down
I know that I'll be standing tall
I used to be an angel
Now I'm just like everybody else
I used to be an angel
Now I'm just like everybody else
I left my wings in the gutter
And my halo is lost, dusty on a shelf
I know a rambling girl
She's driving me crazy and wild
I know a rambling girl
She's driving me crazy and wild wild wild
I'd have Austin as my footstool and the world as my throne
If only she were by my side
I got a couple of food stamps
And a caffeine buzz
I got a couple of food stamps
And a caffeine buzz
So I'd be set for right now, darling
If I only knew just where she was
You might also likeI'd tell her to hold tight, honey
Don't you lose your spirit to the wind
I'd tell her, hold tight, honey
Don't you lose your spirit to the wind
'Cause I know you and I know you'll be a long-time rambling
Before you see your rest again
Oh maybe I'm a poor girl
But I don't worry about it none
Maybe I'm a poor girl
But I don't worry about it none
When this world comes crashing down
I know that I'll be standing in the sun
I'll be standing in the sunEmbed
