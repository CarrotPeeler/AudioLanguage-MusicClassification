7 ContributorsIn the Morning I’ll Be Better Lyrics
I’ll wipe your cares away
That I might spare you pain
Let everybody say that I’m gone for ya
Say you’re my baby
We’re sublimating

I’ll write a hymn again
(I’ll write a hymn again)
I’ll be your woman (woman)
Keep on believing in
Our own healing
Oh, baby

I’ll wrap myself around you
Where we can’t be found
I’ll hide you from the world
’Til we’re forgotten
Say you’re my baby
We’re sublimating

I’ll write a hymn again
(I’ll write a hymn again)
I’ll be your woman (woman)
Keep on believing in
Our own healing
You might also like
In the morning, I’ll be
Oh, better, better, yeah
In the morning, I’ll be
Oh, better, better, yeah
Though our bodies have betrayed us
In a million different ways
In the morning, I’ll be
Oh, better, better, yeah3Embed
