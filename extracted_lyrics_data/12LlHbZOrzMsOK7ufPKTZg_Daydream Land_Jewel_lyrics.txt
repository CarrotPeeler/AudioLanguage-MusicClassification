2 ContributorsDaydream Land Lyrics
Deep in the canyon
Down in the old woods
Where the hermit thrushes sing
I sit where the sun shines
In a ferny circle
And fly away on daydream's wings

I fly and I fly to my daydream land
I fly and I fly 'til the sun goes down
I fly and I fly 'til the moon comes up
And then I fly back home


Deep in the canyon
Down in the old woods
Where the hermit thrushes sing
I sit where the sun shines
In a ferny circle
And fly away on daydream wings

I fly and I fly to my daydream land
I fly and I fly 'til the sun goes down
I fly and I fly 'til the moon comes up
And then I fly back home
And then I fly back homeYou might also likeEmbed
