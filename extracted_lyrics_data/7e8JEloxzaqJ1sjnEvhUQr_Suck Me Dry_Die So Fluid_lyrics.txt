Forgot to breathe
'Cause I can't hear my own thoughts
When yours are screaming for attention
I clear you a space to sleep

Soak up your sympathy
'Cause you won't find it elsewhere
There's nothing left but rape in this world
So squeeze the last drop from me

Suck me dry
Suck me dry
Suck me dry (dry)
Suck me
Dry
Suck me dry
Suck me dry
Dry

And then you'll see there's nothing clever
In refusing to learn to fly
Just stick your needle right in
And suck me dry
You might also like
Suck me dry
Suck me dry
Suck me dry
Suck me dry
Dry
Suck me dry
Suck mе dry

Suck me dry
Suck me dry
Suck me dry
Suck mе dry
Suck me dry
Suck me dry
Suck me dry
Suck me dryEmbed
