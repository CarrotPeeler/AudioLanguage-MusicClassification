5 ContributorsRebel Monster Lyrics
Drunk again, my baby
Well, the water ain't my brand
That goddamn demon booze, forever hunting
Sitting on my shoulder, talking to my inner self
Well, let's forever feed that rebel monster

Well, here we go again, no rules are set
And let us stay on the running train, forever pumping
No ink on papers to show the motherfuckers who I am
Let's forever be that rebel monster

Forever let the train be running
Without breaks
To a place like nothing else
A feeling out of tears
They came from everywhere
To see the running train
Wishing they were part of it

Duka, duka, duka, bunga, bunga
Just hold on
Because the train went up in the air
And crashed to the ground
Boiled in blood, my baby
With a broken leg and arm
Let's forever bleed that rebel monster
You might also like
They came across the land
To get the lying train back on track
And worked for days
The sun were burning them
Someone stayed and someone left
But now it runs again to a place
Like nothing elseEmbed
