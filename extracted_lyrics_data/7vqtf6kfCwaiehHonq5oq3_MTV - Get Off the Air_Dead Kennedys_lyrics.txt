30 ContributorsM.T.V. - Get Off the Air Lyrics
(Fun, fun, fun in the fluffy chair
Flame up the herb, wolf down the beer
Fun, fun, fun in the fluffy chair
Flame up the herb, wolf down the beer
Fun, fun, fun in the fluffy chair
Flame up the herb, wolf down the beer
Fun, fun, fun in the fluffy chair
Flame up the herb, wolf down the beer
Fun, fun, fun in the fluffy chair
Flame up the herb, wolf down the beer
Fun, fun, fun in the fluffy chair
Flame up the herb, wolf down the beer
Fun, fun, fun in the fluffy chair
Flame up the herb, wolf down the beer
Fun, fun, fun in the fluffy chair
Flame up the herb, wolf down the beer)

Hi, I'm your video DJ!
I always talk like I'm wigged out on quaaludes
I wear a satin baseball jacket everywhere I go
My job is to help destroy what's left of your imagination
By feeding you endless doses
Of sugar-coated mindless garbage
So, don't create; be sedate
Be a vegetable at home and thwack on that dial
If we have our way, even you will believe
This is the future of rock and roll
MTV, get off the air!
You might also like
How far will you go, how low will you stoop
To tranquilize our minds with your sugar-coated swill?
You've turned rock-and-roll rebellion into Pat Boone sedation
Making sure that nothing's left to the imagination

MTV, get off the, MTV, get off the, MTV, get off the air!
MTV, get off the, MTV, get off the, MTV, get off the air!
Get off the air!

See the latest rejects from the Muppet Show
Shake their tits and their dicks as they lip-sync on screen
There's something I don't like about a band who always smiles
Another tax write-off for some schmuck who doesn't care

MTV, get off the, MTV, get off the, MTV, get off the air!
MTV, get off the, MTV, get off the, MTV, get off the air!
Get off the air! Get off the air! Get off the air!


And so it was our beloved corporate gods
Claimed they created rock video
Allowing it to sink as low in one year
As commercial TV has in twenty-five
"It's the new frontier," they say
"It's wide open, anything can happen"
But you've got a lot of nerve to call yourself a pioneer
When you're too goddamned conservative to take real chances

Tin-eared, graph-paper-brained
Accountants instead of music fans
Call all the shots at giant record companies now
The lowest common denominator rules

Forget honesty, forget creativity
The dumbest buy the mostest, that's the name of the game
But sales are slumping, and no one will say why
Could it be they put out one too many lousy records?

MTV, get off the air now!1Embed
