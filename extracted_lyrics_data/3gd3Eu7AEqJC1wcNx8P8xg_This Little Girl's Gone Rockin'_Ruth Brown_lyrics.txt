Wella wella wella wella
Washed all the dishes and i did a lot more
I even bought the dinner at the grocery store
And now, mom, you'll find the key next door
This little girl's gone rockin'
I left some biscuits for the pup
I put fresh water in his cup
And now i'm off, i'm gonna live it up
This little girl's gone rockin'
Well, i'll be home about twelve tonight
And not a minute minute minute later
Don't forget the front door light
You might also likeThat's all for now, i'll see you later, mater
You'll find each thing that you wanted done
I'm off to meet that special one
And boy oh boy will we have fun
'cause this little girl's gone rockin'Embed
