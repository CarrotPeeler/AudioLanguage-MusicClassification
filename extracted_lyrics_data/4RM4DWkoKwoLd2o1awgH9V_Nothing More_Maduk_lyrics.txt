1 ContributorNothing More LyricsI been waitin’ for the light of ?
To show me where your heart lies
Your shadow’s castin’ another silhouette
I don’t like what is hiding
Just new days ahead now
I’m gonna live what i believe
Is gonna move us along
But we won’t stop, we wont stop tryin’
Throw your hands up
Mve cause you can’t stop
There’s nothing more I need
There’s new days ahead
There’s new days ahead
There’s new days ahead

There’s new days ahead now
I’m gonna live what i beliеve
Its gonna move us along
But we won’t stop, wе wont stop tryin’
Throw your hands up
We gonna move because we can’t stop
There’s nothing more we needEmbed
