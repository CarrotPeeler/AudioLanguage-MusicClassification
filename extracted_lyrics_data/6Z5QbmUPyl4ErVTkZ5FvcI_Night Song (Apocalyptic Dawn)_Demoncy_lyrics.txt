1 ContributorNight Song (Apocalyptic Dawn) LyricsAnother Sun Sets On Baleful Lands
Transmuting Into A Crimson Orb Of Transient Wonder
The Last Of It's Waning Rays Die
As The Lady Of The Night's Song Starts Anew
My Lady Of Darkness
Shed Thy Earthly Guise
So That The Meek Might See Destruction
As Black Tears Rain From The Sky
Your Image Is Splendor
Gaiety Amidst Death
Close Now Thy Ebony Wings
And Steal The World's Dying Breath
Resplendent In Silver, The First Strains Of Her Epic Of Woe
Enthrall The Nocturnal Beings Drawn To Her Sight
A Doleful Opus To The Wonders Of Night
Enveloped In A Shroud Of Pain
In A Voice Tainted By A Millenia Of Torment
Her Song Has Reached Crescendo
And Her Descent Is Nearly Complete
Shadows Of Magic Ascend From Dusk
Revealing The Moon For All To See
My Lady Of Darkness
Shed Thy Earthly Guise
So That The Meek Might See Destruction
As Black Tears Rain From The Sky
Your Image Is Splendor
Gaiety Amidst Death
Close Now Thy Ebony Wings
And Steal The World's Dying BreathYou might also likeEmbed
