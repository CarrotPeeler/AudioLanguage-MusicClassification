6 ContributorsBurial Lyrics
When will this winter end?
The snow's been fallin' for months
The town all dressed in white
And my skin is burning from the wind

A cold sun in disguise
An assault from the morning light
My burial, I can't succeed
Frozen and paralyzed

Oh, winter
Oh, winter
Oh, winter
Oh, winter
Oh, winter
Oh, winter
Oh, winter
Oh, winter

Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
