'Cause I can't see anyone but you
Are the stars out tonight?
Baby, I don't know if it's cloudy or bright
'Cause I only have eyes for you
'Cause I only have eyes for you
Yeah
The moon, it may be high
But I can't see a thing in the sky
'Cause I only have eyes for you
'Cause I only have eyes for you
Yeah, yeah, hey, hey, hey
Hey, have eyes for you
You are here, so am I
Maybe millions of people, they go by
But they all disappear from view
'Cause I only have eyes for you
You, only have eyes for youYou might also likeEmbed
