Out of my grave, dust off my name
Get out a good pair of shoes
Summertime, soak up the sunshine with you
Lay in the park, smoke in the dark
Get high like I used to do
Summertime, soak up the sunshine with you
Summertime, soak up the sunshine with you

Feeling the breeze, take it with ease
Shake off the big city blues
Summertime, soak up the sunshine with you
Grow out my hair, go anywhere
Sleep in until afternoon
Summertime, soak up the sunshine with you
Summertime, soak up the sunshine with you
Alright

Feeling the breeze, take it with ease
Shake off the big city blues
Summertime, soak up the sunshine with you
Lay in the park, smoke in the dark
Get high like I used to do
Summertime, soak up the sunshine with you
Summertime, soak up the sunshine with youYou might also like1Embed
