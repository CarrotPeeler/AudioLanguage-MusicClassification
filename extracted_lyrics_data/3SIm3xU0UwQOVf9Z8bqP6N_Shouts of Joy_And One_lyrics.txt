1 ContributorShouts of Joy LyricsYou saw the danger
Signs in the dark
Sons of the stranger
Know they bite before they bark
They hunt the preacher
Right next to me
Come see the creatures swinging on the highest ring
I hear the creatures singing every song for me
We are, we are to celebrate
With your shouts of joy
We are, we are the sound
You're searching for
(And you don't look too far)
You found your way to raise your voice
For the shouts of joy
Shouts of joy
You've got the power
We've got the key
We tag the walls of pride and decency
They talk about it but the music and the words are not the same to me
No doubt about it, every single blank must quad another starving queen
We are, we are to celebrate
With your shouts of joy
We are, we are the sound
You're searching for
(And you don't look too far)
You found your way to raise your voice
For the shouts of joy
