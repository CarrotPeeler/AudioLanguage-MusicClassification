1 ContributorYour Sweetness LyricsYou have the darkest stare and words that peel
Peel the color away from me
You’re sharp and lingering
Your sweetness spills all over me

The way things start always feels so inviting
But growth brings out the worst in me
Commitment against your fears pulled this into pieces
I pulled this into pieces before we laid down
We laid ourselves down only to hold
To hold the truthlessness between our palms
Within the worldly feeling that I used to have
Falling into you and into nothing

You’re sharp and lingering
Your sweetness
Your sweetness spills all over meYou might also likeEmbed
