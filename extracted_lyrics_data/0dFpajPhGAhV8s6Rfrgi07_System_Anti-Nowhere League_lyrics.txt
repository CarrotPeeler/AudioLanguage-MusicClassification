1 ContributorSystem LyricsI am...the way
I'm free to claim my land
And you'll bow at my command
With blood I shall control
Now I am free to rape your very soul
Your hate is all you show
So your hate has made me grow
No hope for any man
I'll take your lies and crush them in my hands
So turn away from what you see
You gave me life I am machine
I'll take you over to the darkest side
I'll send you up to genocide
Through time I've waited long
I've watched your petty wars for much too long
Machine is what I am
Now watch me spread my chaos through the land
Don't turn away from what you see
You gave me life I am machine
I'll take you over to the darkest side
I'll send you up to genocide
You might also like...You know not what you are
I am machine
Religion has a ? on a blood-stained land
Genetic engineers try to save me in their plan
Two thousand years, shed a million tears
You've had your say, now it's my day
I am the way
I am the system
I am the way
I am the system
I am the way
I am the system
And I...will destroy
And I...will destroy
And I...will destroy
And I...will destroyEmbed
