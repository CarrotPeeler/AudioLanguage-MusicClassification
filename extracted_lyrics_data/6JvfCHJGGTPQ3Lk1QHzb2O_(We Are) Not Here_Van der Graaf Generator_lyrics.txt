1 Contributor(We Are) Not Here LyricsI dreamed you here beside me
Radiant, impulsively strong
Light streaming through us blindly
We are not here for long
I dreamed us from the ether
Bursting through the neural stem
Vibration without meter...
We are not here again
We are not here again
(No way to know that when)
We are not here again
(there is no now in then)
We are not here again
(We are not there and then we are
Henceforth we are not here again.)You might also likeEmbed
