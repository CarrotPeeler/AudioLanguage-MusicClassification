1 ContributorHoneymoon LyricsCaught up with the morning sun
Driving suitcases along
Everything I have is packed and on
I'm cheering up the road's my friend
I'm chasing my love and
I'm fearing consequence
It won't be long until they find
Your bodyparts and they'll decide
To never ever have seen something
Sick as this ___
They draw a picture of my mind
These busy police psychologists
They make me smile
For a while
Cheer up it's honeymoon
The disappointment in your eyes it yells at me
Cheer up it's honeymoon
An army of policemen chasing after me
My identity it's now
Broadcasted in every show
Be aware this man is dangerous
He's armed insane and very treacherous
I dye my hair put glasses on
A woman is what I've become
I hitchhike and I kill again
Another car I'm hiding
Cheer up it´s honeymoon
The disappointment in your eyes it yells at me
Our fatal honeymoon
The distance in your eyes it yells at me
I'm on the run
Well the mind's a horrible thing to taste
And a brain in broken scull's a waste
A predator's most dangerous hunted down
Cheer up it´s honeymoon
The disappointment in your eyes it yells at me
Our fatal honeymoon
And I'm afraid this time I have just
Crossed the line___
A hurricane of blood and pain
I can't control myself insane
Time to step out of my life
Like every husband every wife
Here I am now bring me down
Another suicide in town
Round and round and round again
Round and round out in the rain
Back again love again sob again
