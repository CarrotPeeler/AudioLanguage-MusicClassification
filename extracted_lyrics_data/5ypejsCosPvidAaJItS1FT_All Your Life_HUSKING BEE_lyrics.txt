Good to watch you sleep at night
Hushing all your life
Nice to have you near to me
Good to feel your sighs

But one of these days
You're sure to be gone
And I'll have to carry on
Without you

It's nice to watch you sleep so deep
Damp and gentle there
And I'd almost call you baby now
Lick and smell your hair

But how can I trust?
You're really in love
And I'll have to carry on
Without you

So shut off your mind and sleep, my love
Drifting bless and dream
Tomorrow is too near, my doll
Tell me where you've been
You might also like
'Cause one of these days
You're sure to be gone
And I'll have to carry on
Without you

Without youEmbed
