4 ContributorsAlways & Forever Lyrics
I don't wanna be calling your phone
And I don't care what time you get home
And I hate the fact that you live so damn close to me
I don't like that I can't stop thinking 'bout you
And I hate that you walk like you do, oh baby

But it's just something 'bout ya
And I just can't take it (Yeah)
Girl it's just something 'bout ya
And I just can't take it
It's your thighs, your lips, your calves, your lips
It's your hair — did I mention your lips? Whoa

Why I behold you
Why do I want you
Always and forever
Always and forever
'Cause girl you got it, I'm gon' keep it
Oh, you got me trippin' on you
So that's why I want you
Always and forever

I don't want to be pickin' you up
Takin' you on dates and sh...
I don't wanna be payin' your bills
Gettin' you all spoiled and sh...
Don't want you to decorate my house but I can't help it
Girl, you make me feel so comfortable
I'd be damned if I let you go, oh
You might also like
But it's just something 'bout ya
And I just can't take it (Something 'bout ya that I just can't take)
Girl, it's just something 'bout ya
And I just can't take it
It's your thighs, your lips, your calves, your lips
It's your hair — did I mention your lips? Whoa

Why I behold you
Why do I want you
Always and forever
Always and forever
'Cause girl you got it, I'm gon' keep it
Oh, you got me trippin' on you
So that's why I want you
Always and forever

I try hard to keep my cool
But I can't live, I can't, I shake
'Cause I'm so strung out on you
But it's cool 'cause I'm gettin' all my hits from you
And girl it gets to me the way that I'm feelin'
It's so crazy 'cause I don't know how I'm dealin'
Girl, if I lose you I'm done
'Cause I know you're that one
Why I behold you
Why do I want you
Always and forever
Always and forever
'Cause girl you got it, I'm gon' keep it
Oh, you got me trippin' on you
So that's why I want you
Always and foreverEmbed
