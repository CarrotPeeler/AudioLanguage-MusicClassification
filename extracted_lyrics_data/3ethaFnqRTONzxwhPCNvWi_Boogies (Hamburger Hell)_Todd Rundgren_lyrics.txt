2 ContributorsBoogies (Hamburger Hell) Lyrics
Beefsteak Charlie says to Porky the Pig
"I can see the party lights
Someone's throwin' a bash and it sure looks big
Down at the slaughterhouse tonight"
Down at the slaughterhouse (down at the slaughterhouse)
Say, let's get together and hit the buffet
You might as well stuff yourself
They'll only throw it away

Old Colonel Sanders says to Elsie the Cow
"Golly, baby you're the one
Two all beef patties, special sauce, lettuce
Pickle, cheese, onions on a sesame seed bun"
Bun on a sesame seed (bun on a sesame seed)
Say, we just got time for a roll in the hay
You might as well stuff yourself
They've come to take you away

I know where you're going, I can tell
Don't go looking for me down in hamburger hell
Don't misunderstand me, I wish you well
Don't go looking for me down in hamburger hell
You might also like


I know where you're going, I can tell
Don't go looking for me down in hamburger hell
Don't misunderstand me, I wish you well
Don't go looking for me down in hamburger hell
