2 ContributorsDNA vs. Viixen The Assassin Lyrics
I told the whole battle culture, "Y'all don't deserve me"
Even on IG, that was the caption
'Cause I was lackin' the passion
But now it's Cleopatra
I got too much poise in this (poisonous), Queen, and you gon' get (w)rapped in this fashion
I'm forgettin' how to punch
Not knowin' how to do my gun gestures waitin' for this day to actually happen
But wit' these Bad Boys, I Will come back for Assassin
Here's where the action stops
You gon' get your flowers...when the casket drops
But that ain't half the plot
I'll show her a pair of Ds (parodies): it's a laughingstock
Bitch, it's a reason for my views, 'cause I been eatin' from the Tube like a astronaut
The bag'll drop!
You battle me, and then the band switch: Apple Watch
The hand lift, that'll stop mad shit: traffic cop!
Jaz, 40, O'fficial all gotta retire for you to have a shot!
I'm thinkin' Jordan's dad: when the rest stop, then Assassin pops!
Stick wit' me
Wizard of Oz: I'm on her heels, and the clique (click) wit' me
Big blikky, and got another Smith from Miami - get jiggy
Double drum: big titties!
That'll have you silent, Assassin
They shoulda never fed you to the wolves: Sin City!
I'm talkin' crazy punchin', .380s dumpin'
I'mma serve Viix' (cervix) and change everything: the baby's comin'!
Aye, Smack! You settin' this up in VA? That was an awesome theme
But I'm from Corona, so I'm better off in (offing) Queens
Don't come up here and rap about your pussy
That'll be a boring scheme
Uma Thurman: I'll punch out the box 'til her coffin seen (scene)!
Aye, I had family in Milwaukee, that used to stalk the streets
Pushin' weight that was far from cheap
The coke so white (*sniff*) it used to watch Dawson's Creek
If they pulled up to the block, they would start some beef
It'd be a Scary Movie if they sparked the heat
I'm talkin' the hand in the Mil' (meal) fuckin' wit' the bird
It's gon' be hard to eat!
If ya folks survive, they holdin' nine
Nah, pass (past) the .40: it's overtime
The pole'll rise, the outcome should be no surprise...
I'm talkin' Assassin on the cartridge like GoldenEye!
These bitches ain't gettin' shit, your fit is a hit-or-miss
I hit up Charlie Clips, put Hollows up in the diss
I got too many guns - which grip will I get to pick?
How 'bout a couple, Assassin? Mr. & Mrs. Smith
After I give the Queens this (diss), these bitches straight Ethered
Two guns to the head, like she tryna imitate Lita
Anwar's girl said I was gon' lose? I don't discriminate either
Now that I know who got this thot juiced, I'mma eliminate Reda (Lemon-Ade-Rita)!
You can't get nothin' past me!
Don't fuckin' at (@) me, for tryna give her pen points (pinpoints) like, "What's the addy?"
If you don't think that plan's it, it's like a Batman flick
I woulda done 'em badly
I'm droppin' jewels and it's apparent (a parent), Assassin - this is up my alley
It's gon' be a long night
You picked the wrong fight
I'm 'bout to get under Viix' (Vix) skin quicker than Fortnite
They gon' say the Queen is spazzin'
But you got ghostwriters, but they gon' believe I'm cappin'
But I don't even have to mention dude
Just know you Expendable without your team, Assassin
I'm about to put you six feet, in the grave without your fam'
I told you this shit is for the taking, but never to take it out of hand
You actually woulda did better wit' a crowd
You shoulda waited for the chance
It'd've been like Selena: we would seen Assassin aided (assassinated) by a fan
Look how I rose to the stage, wit' the .9 in hand
I hit a couple circles: diagram
One shot'll make Assassin bend (Ben): Spider-Man
You can reach for your gun, I wouldn't try it, fam'
Or be lookin' at half of you (view) in 2020 like a eye exam
Aye, T-Top, why they wanna war wit' vets?
The Bear said, "What's the cause of death?"
I said, "Once in a Blue Moon, you gotta have a Stella(r) performance and take out Milwaukee's Best."
Time
You might also like
Thank you for taking this battle
They said I really need you
They said when they see DNA, they click...(*chk-chk*) bitch, me too!
What you gon' do? Claim I'm not top-tier like these other bitches?
Listen, I might spaz
Tonight, I'm gon' be Stella(r)
Even during Corona, don't think a bitch from the Mil' a light (Miller Lite) draft!
Understand, I'm the whole package
It didn't happen overnight, but paid the cost for this
I'll get a male boxed (mailbox), pull up to where he post, off his (office) shit!
They sent the check - that's great
I told 'em a flat rate, or I can't mess wit' it
After all those forms of delivery, watch ma get on some domestic shit
Who takin' a L? I am (M)? O(h), not today
I got enough kick to beat Tina in the limo, that's all I(ke) could say
If your punches land? Cool
They just better not touch my face
You all thought he was gon' beat a bitch 'cause this a D-V case?
Not today!
Whoever booked this, don't know me dumb well
Caffeine, after all the men y'all advertise...how I get stuck wit' the junk male (mail)?
I was 'posed to battle Loso
You never was 'posed to see me today
And Smack must be a preacher, how fast he got me to pray (prey)
I know God shed blood for us, so, Lo', I didn't need you to tell me today
And just like God's sacrifice, all that's left after this cross is DNA
Bitch, you came outta retirement for me? Ooh, I'm feelin' the tension
If I steal, get lost (loss): nigga this is prevention
I'll hit you wit' three, D - am I forgettin' to mention?
BOW! Leg shot!
He'll retire again after I pin shins (pension)!
Bitch, your name Eric St. John...that's not tough
I'm here to dog E, style (doggystyle) on him, blow his back out rough
But since we face-to-face and you on top?
Cool - my mission: air E (missionary)
Boy, you flat-out fucked!
So what's up?
My respect, I demand that here!
Or it's sticks, bangin' on your ceiling
Now you talkin' to the Man Upstairs!
This was never fair, he dead-dead
Dome shot, he bled-bled
That '70s Show: y'all gon' see Eric wit' a red head
I slide on him, then ride on him!
I'm just lettin' you know how dumb you sound when you think you K-Shine!
I just thought I should try it on him!
NWX full of pussies, so please don't mention a threat
Boy, I'm a bad bitch
All I need is a (*smack*) new dick to get rid of a X (ex)
They sayin' I'm less, they all dumb
Bitch, you a fraud bum
What shoot better, a .38 or a .40?
I'm just testin' DNA to make sure I ain't raisin' the wrong one!
Nigga, you got the wrong one
I seen your presidential ad, and that's sad
But listen for what's next to play
'Cause you'll be abidin' (Biden) by the pole (poll) like Election Day
Boy, do we all feel played
It's a lesson in this, bro
You did that ad for the bag, not the people, and we know
Fuck your message
Boy, you messy, and it shows
Ironic, you was behind closed curtains and got a check to get the vote
So rebuttal this, rebuttal that, and tell me what you provin'
How could you scream "Black Lives Matter" and it's 2020, you still lettin' a white man hang you?
Man, this shit is a noose-ance (nuisance)
I'm not tellin' y'all not to vote, but make it make sense
If that's what you believe in, you was better off keepin' your mouth closed, bitch!
'Cause all real minorities know Trump and Biden ain't shit!
Rap, coon!
(*DNA adjusts his footing in the ring*)
...I had to make sure I had the right angle before I stepped in front of this camera
You know I didn't wanna mess this up
You know, behind the scenes, as long as you stick to the script, you get a different treatment to earn your respect and trust
You get a Little Hype, then Boom, then you're doin' whatever it takes for the extra bucks
It's male dominance, lower a woman's confidence so they never tell the directors "Cut"
You ain't a vixen, you a victim, but only a few could see
I mean, you showed up for the screenin', got a name and don't even know the meanin'
But this ain't nothin' new to D (nudity)
See, the thots and the hoes, they gon' hate I'm cookin'
I mean, yeah, I'mma put you down, but still make you the greater woman
The middlemen belittlin' in negotiations when the checks bounce
You got this image that they sketched out
But what's the sense of (censor) revealin' this body if it can't take the X out?
There I go showin' too much
I'm preachin', keep your lips sealed
The only way I wanna see Viixen (vixen) butt in on the card is if it's a 'Tip Drill'
They comin' for E - I know, it's a secret
Tell 'em "Keep it", with all of that freak shit
You puttin' all that work in the car, and they ain't even tell you you could lease (Kelis) it
Oh, you tryna trick me 'cause you Bossy?
If you wanna change your mind, you still can
I mean, your 'Milkshake' brings all the boys to the yard, but it never got you a real man
And you're more stressed
And if we talk sex?
You got this wet-ass pussy on camera, but can't keep a nigga faithful off set (Offset)
This the big presentation
Your grades decline when you're out chasing guys, 'cause ya skipped registration
But they usually lure in (Lauryn) the ones who miss education (Miseducation)
I know y'all ain't expect the knowledge
For me to get up here and give y'all somethin' thought-provokin'
So when you go home, it'll press your conscience
Now I ain't gotta watch the Caffeine stream or check the comments
'Cause they sayin', "DNA, why you not punchin'?"
It's 'cause she's used to domestic violence!
You gon' be left in silence
Victoria Stephans, you impressive
But the objective is to do more than just sellin' your ass
And y'all got the same last name
But if you was anything like Karinne, you would be ahead of your class
It's mystical (Mystikal)
They just wanna see you 'Shake That Ass', so they can sell it if it's proper
But not respect it if ya prosper
But now you in Danger! So get on the floor!
'Cause I mean, it's 'Been So Long' since we seen Stephans (Steffans) on a chopper
You been fuckin' them rap stars, gettin' them wack bars
They made that song f-
See, that there was hard
I'm just givin' you Game
For the record, Viixen (vixen), I knew you 'Wouldn't Get Far'
They say it's Illuminati in battle rap
Fuckin' Norbes and Showstoppa was your sacrifice?
Well, shit, that's gon' get you a Proving Grounds battle in the afterlife
When you shoulda picked Murda (murder) and Hitman
To me, that's more of the Assassin type
Ain't you biracial!? Well, it's Marilyn Monroe if the cash is right
I mean, I couldn't picture addressin' how this Viixen (vixen) blew up, 'til I seen it in black-and-white!
Now before I skrrt (skirt) off, I'mma be as honest as honest can be
At the URL events, the nigga Norbes barely got in for free
You shoulda gave the pussy to the nigga that threw the BANNED battles
Just don't tell him you got it from me
I mean, it's serious talent
The Period Challenge: she shoulda gave the body to P (pee)!
You watchin' this guy black (Skyy Black) on cam', it's nothin' nice
They Pinky-promise not to tell about your Lethal lips (Lipps) if the money's right
But you fucked him twice
Caucasian and Cherokee, but don't look at D as (D'Ass) the cuffin' type
It's disgustin' how you made it to the X videos (XVideos)
Get out my fuckin' sight (site)!
Now y'all gon' label me as a jerk, but the Saga continues...
She can't stand for the pressure
That's why I'm just up here playing, pickin' her brain: Hannibal Lecter!
They gon' abuse you and use you until you handle it better
You don't even see the machine got a leg up on Viixen (vixen) like Planet of Terror!
Should I elaborate?
Jaz was mainstream before she knew how to masturbate
And you gon' do whatever if the cash is great, hopin' that your ass and face a carrier
I mean, niggas had your cakes, it put you in a badder (batter) place
And now you wanna retaliate 'cause half the place embarrassed ya
You don't even know how to navigate
You on half a tank, and I'm too fast to race
You won't be the last to break the barriers
But why would I need to assassin Assassin when every day Assassin assassinates her character!?
Lux, Geechi, Ave - who want the prob'?
I only showed back up to battle rap to do my fuckin' job
I really liked that lil' Norbes shit, but that shit dead
After I heard about that lawsuit, I did text him like, "Hey bighead"
Debo! How y'all said you was givin' me a better look, but I got the ugliest motherfucker on the card?
I'm appalled
I need y'all to understand what I mean
Ironic a nigga named DNA...could never intertwine wit' these jeans (genes)
You remember in 2018, you was in my inbox callin' me "a beautiful queen"?
Please - don't even try to play me, bastard
I even got your number saved as "DNA"
Yeah, bitch - "Do Not Answer"!
Give me my credit! My pen (PIN) been valid in the streets!
And when I slid on this card, just know V's a (VISA) beast!
I'll run down on St. John quick
Kill whoever St. John with, like "Fuck, is this the St. John clique?"
Everybody wanna be a hitman 'til they dog get killed
Now St. John Wick!
Eric, you'se a bitch!
You not a champ, you a chump
I'm knowin' your bluff
Loadin' it up
Stomach shot, on a Wednesday
His mid' weak (midweek): he won't get over the hump!
You a dead opp', head nod, red dot
I am Karinne Steffans when the lead pop
'Cause yeah, I took D, but all they remember was a SUPER HEADSHOT!
What, y'all don't like to hear gun bars from us women?
Well, I don't like to hear gun bars from these bitches
Listen, you usin' a gun bar? Still worse than me
Even Player's Club showed a Viixen (vixen) used a pole to get her first degree
It gets worser, D
You a girl dad
I'll kidnap that lil' bitch, he thinkin' she missin'
Whole time I got that lil' ho in the kitchen
Standin' over her with the pole
Every father's worst nightmare: his daughter lookin' up to a Viixen (vixen)!
You can get it, knife or a pound to the face
Run down him wit' the blade: let's cut down to the chase!
Nigga, these'll be the reason they gassin'
Y'all get to eggin' him on, and I'mma get to over (ovary)-reactin'
Lock-loaded, Pop Smoke him
Glock-19 in DNA: it's not COVID
I'm exposin' these lame faggots
What he spit is tragic
He not a shooter or sick: he a simp to 'matics (asymptomatic)
It was almost bad
They gave us a couple weeks to write
I was tight, this some frustrating shit
I had to Hustle to Prep...this a toxic relationship
Tell me who you playin' wit'
Runnin' yo' mouth only gon' make matters worse
He don't want none (nun)
I will leave St. John statue-stiff in a Catholic church
Those mags you burst? I know they fake!
Step in my space? One to the face!
Try to talk through the middle of this round!? ROOKIE MISTAKE!
I don't CARE if you great or you top-tier!
You still losin' yo' spot here!
Drug test: DNA gettin' dropped here!
And Smack failed, 'cause I was smokin' before I got here
Bitch, you not a shooter
Why you writin' like that?
Beefin' over the 'Net...pussy, why you typin' like that?
Beat him wit' the gun, yeah, I'm strikin' like that
Got DNA on the butt...'cause my nigga know I like it like that!
Oh, 'cause I'm not about that life?
Invite 'em in (Vitamin), D
They pale in comparison
I get darker every time I push a melon in (melanin)
You had a race angle, I still really wish you well
They think bringin' up my white blood count? I just think being sick'll (sickle) cell
I'm snappin' on niggas, packin' on niggas
Mama, I finally made it to Caffeine!
I'm still SMACK-in' on niggas
I'm mixed!
They been tellin' me to "choose a side" my whole life!
I finally did! I'm blackin' on niggas!
Generic Eric, you gon' have to come harder
I say Black Lives Matter
You think Joe Biden matter
Why the fuck do I bother?
Don't you forget the only Eric we care about is Eric Garner
Rap, coon

Listen...
This round, I ain't gon' spit no punchlines
I just came up here to drop the wisdom
No matter how the media portrays us as African-Americans, we are not the victims
Stop and listen
You said it, you Black and white, but that's what got me trippin'
'Cause you somewhere in that 50 Shades of Grey
And all them safe words can't stop the whippin's
Fuck opinions, I'm spittin' facts now
You got this image you tryna keep clean
But a green screen couldn't change your background
Your ancestors are racist
But lemme guess, you're half-Black and half-proud
Bitch, my name is DNA - I know that it's passed down
I don't care about half the critics
You responsible for takin' away our leaders, and that's bad for business
'Cause when Martin Luther King and Malcolm X died, Assassin didn't!
We don't got the same thinkin'
The one person that freed our slaves, y'all killed him
Let that name sink in
See, that's the shit I been dyin' to show Assassin: Abe Lincoln
And you s'posed to be the one sent (cent)?
I find that fascinatin'
'Cause you'll never know how it feels to be racially profiled goin' to the store
No exaggeration
The cops behind you, it's past the hatin'
They cut you off before you get ahead: decapitation
Assaults and the lacerations
Or gettin' denied a job for checkin' off the wrong box on the application!
When we walk in the room, notice they get to starin'
I told the Culture, "Y'all don't deserve me"
This the closest I'mma get to carin' (Karen)
You got me extra mad!
When you go home, tell your folks to address your past
All I know is a Black man gave you your first and your second half
Smack like, "Let him brag"
If I didn't accept this battle, you wouldn't be here in the ring if I ain't accept the bag
Which means it's DNA behind the books like Dexter's Lab
But it's not just you, sweetie!
It's my own people tryna pop the bottle
Sayin' I'm a sellout for doin' the Biden campaign, but that's a pill that I gotta swallow
I seen the blog from Hollow
Sayin' "It's the motto not to follow"
But where the FUCK was all that energy for Avocado!?!
When these broke niggas get broke, lose money, and lose a match
They get on Twitter postin' contracts and try to dispute wit' Smack
Instead of admittin' a Black man changed their lives and not salutin' that
But will tuck their tail for the White Man and let him move in rap
All them niggas on the other side, that's in that tournament
They coons and it's a proven fact
'Cause they still got a racist behind the scenes shootin' Blacks!
The love has faded, the trust is hatred
Math, how are you a "Expert" if you got a excerpt with a fuckin' racist!?!
If you read between the lines, it's for the views and another statement
He ain't tryna add sense
'Cause he was just worried about AdSense and his monthly payments
In this game, I'm goin' so hard
To get through, I'mma bogard
If Hip Hop Is Real and Avocado put a camera in my face, he gets NO bars! (Noo Barz)
Restore Order and 15 Minutes of Fame, I love y'all
But right now my mind is different
'Cause if a Black man did what Avocado did, you wouldn't find it in your heart
You would find statistics
Unkle Ra, you coulda stopped it!
But you just wanted a story that provided interest
But since you family, I'mma give my uncle time (Tom) to fix it
Aye, Hollow!
AYE, HOLLOW!
AYE, HOLLOW!
AYE, HOLLOW!
Aye, HOLLOW!
I don't wanna battle you
And I don't want this to be soundin' like it's beef
But you tried to kick me when I'm down
Really get some clout up when you speak
The nigga had the nerve to say me and Clips ain't hip-hop
He damn near snitched on the phone!
Movin' like a clown up in these streets!
So you ARE the KRS-One of battle rap!
You know the 'Sound of da Police'!
Niggas keep talkin' 'bout respect, you ain't gon' get the love 'til you dead
In this community it's no unity 'til you catch one in the head
I bet they still gon' put me down, but I can cover the spread
I ain't come to play, boy (Playboy) Viixen, these issues couldn't be left under the bed
You talkin' 'bout me on some beef shit, this a game changer
Bang
I got the gauge aimer
I'm thinkin' if I shoot some'll (summer) body
But if you think this a bitch, well waste (waist) trainer
I'm here to spaz
These niggas talkin' 'bout they beef with
A bunch of niggas talkin' 'bout I feel like street shit is street shit
Niggas that get on camera and talk about it in barbershops is the niggas I can't beef with
I'm not concerned about who is doing this with that one and who they sleep with
From start to finish, that's why I get crazy and lose my mind when the barber's in it
I'm so conscious with my daughter, she can't even watch my battles from start to finish
You talkin' 'bout her lookin' up to a vixen, I wouldn't even bother with it
Bitch I'm on that stage right now giving you that talk your father didn't
I gotta wild out
These niggas talkin' 'bout, "DNA tryin' to miss "
Hollow goin' on Instagram postin' up contracts cause he ain't makin' big moves
It's cause the nigga freezin' cold
Iced out like an igloo
You're damn right Instagram don't know how much money I got, my kids do
And that's the way I move, so I'ma book her again when the lead pop
Flintstones make the bed rock (Bedrock)
You disrespect me you get a bun that goes over the top and it's a headshot
Oh, you gon' shrug ya arms
You should stop talkin' when I'm rappin', it's good with the date
I know you can twerk (Twork) bitch but now you makin' that rookie mistake
Why would you keep talkin'? When the heats sparkin'
Leave you right there, dead, in the streets walkin'
Niggas talkin' 'bout they get go, I let the steel let go
And it's over Smack, I'm the best, let's get to the next flow

You had to freestyle cause you was losin'. That's good
That was a good round, I'm still makin' a homi
You brought up this waist trainer, I just want it to be clear I'm the one makin' a body
Listen, why would you play wit' me?
I wouldn't even play with myself
Cause as soon as I get to wipin', DNA, I'm ashamed of myself
I made a name for myself
No co-sign, no cheerin' section
To you, that's a minor move
People been standin' in the rooms quiet my whole career
What made you think I couldn't stand in a quiet room?
I earn my stripes, I pay my dues
My career took blood, sweat and tears
I gave them DNA and then they gave me you
So anybody say I don't deserve this, lame as fuck
Suicide, I made the cut
You the bigger name, so what?
All you get is a name tag in the morgue
Plus, it's 2020, people choosin' they own sex, DNA don't matter anymore
Congratulations, your come back to the battle rap world was a girl
If you lose to a bitch you a bitch
If you don't lose to a bitch you still a bitch for takin' a bitch
So why brag on yourself?
Like how bitches do fat transfers, DNA you made an ass out yo'self
I seen your face off with Verb and it showed me the grime in nigga
You said you buy the car she do the drivin'
Okay, that's how you described it nigga
Well if I pull this .9 and blow her mind is you sidin' with her?
No, how could you ride for her if you too busy riding with her?
And that right there, shows why you couldn't downplay the ladies on the card if you tryin' to
Bitch, your own household proves, females got more drive than you
So they can say, females too tough
Too hood, too gangsta
They try it, I expect that from bitch boys that don't pay bills or change tires
I protect me
So if I seem tough, then maybe it's true
You too busy tryin' to see the man in me, instead of recognizing the bitch in you
I don't get you
I know your pops past, I know it hurt that you don't have a male there
I know it hurts even worse is that your mother had to teach you to be a stand up nigga from a wheelchair
Eric Lamar St. John
How would your mother feel if she knew you was up here talkin' to me like this?
She would be livid
Bragging about all the opportunities you giving me
Ain't men supposed to open doors for us women?
I don't get it
You act tough with me, but with the men you not as brave
You said you ain't help a gun since you was 15 and I can tell
Playa, you done lost your ways
They don't wanna see me rap, they'd rather see me twerk, that's what they often say
But bitch you couldn't handle the twerk (Twork), he nearly pushed you off the stage
So stop sayin' who you better than
How many times has Eric ran?
I will slap the bitch out you and introduce him to a better man
Damn, wow, it make sense why you in the position you in now
Your mothers in a wheelchair and you only known for niggas pushin' you around
You fuckin' clown
You not no legend at the top
No Mooks, No Lux, what legends have you dropped?
How are (R) you rated G but never seen no Glock?
I run down on the PG Killer and see (NC) 17 shots
So just stop, you never was a match for me
I was on card before and after you
And you was at the bottom of the card before and after me
But actually...
I hate ya hairline, get that the fuck outta here
Look at his mustache, get this pedophile the fuck outta here
Until they start puttin' respect on females, get battle rap the fuck outta here
And if Norbes do text me back I'm gettin' Smack the fuck outta here!
I'm the queen of the midwest
I'm what matters in this bitch
I've been holdin' it down the long, it ain't no Gattas in this bitch
So y'all can go and find another bitch that thinks she fuckin' with me
But make sure she's sugar free
Cause these bitches sweet
{Viixen kisses DNA on the cheek}
Body gang

Yo don't let her do that. Don't let her do that. Get ya girl, don't let her do that. Don't let her do that. Don't let her do that
 Is that the kiss of death?
 Yeeeeeah!Embed
