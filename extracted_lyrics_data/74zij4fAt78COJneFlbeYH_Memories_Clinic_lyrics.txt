2 ContributorsMemories Lyrics
Memories are the pieces of the puzzle you wanted
Memories are your pieces of gold

Memories are your wealth and the warmth here you wander
Memories are your pieces of gold
Down all the lanes that you treasure and travel
Down all the lanes that you own

Glowing in your eyes down the decades forever
Glowing and your eyes, never dim
Memories full of joy and the laughter they're bringing
Memories that ought to have been
All all all
All you know

Memories for a lifetime
Memories are all your own
Memories for a lifetime
Memories are all your own
Memories are all your ownYou might also likeEmbed
