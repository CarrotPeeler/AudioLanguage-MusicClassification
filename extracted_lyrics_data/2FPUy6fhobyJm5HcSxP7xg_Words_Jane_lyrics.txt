1 ContributorThe wrong kid Lyrics
Time to hit hard  y'all be fucking with the wrong kid
Time to hit hard  y'all be fucking with the wrong kid
Traveling through dimension call it Rick & Morty
Traveling through dimension call it Rick & Morty
Time to hit hard  y'all be fucking with the wrong kid
Time to hit hard  y'all be fucking with the wrong kid
I be droppin' bomb now I'm wanted like a terrorist
I be droppin' bomb now I'm wanted like a terrorist

Huh
Cool breeze cool breeze,sunset oh jeez
We live young live young, long live og's
Fuck this,fuck hits light one ,blow tress
Order some chug some  Ass cheeks,grab some yeah
Being honest got them fake folks step out of my range
All nighter till the hole squad pullin' up  in a range
My accent keep your 2 cents I don't need any change
Ego so big bet that fucker has a twin,I know this is strange
Yeah you're traumatized traumatize
Trying hard that's compromised
So many hours  of verses ,I had to buy me  a hard drive
If I ever get  a cake, family and homies gon' get a slice
I be sippin' on some  blue sprite
Promethazine what a great advice
They say body language never lies
Always  hangin' out like clothes to dry
Never abandon  stay close to trying
Throwin' fingers to the judge
Until he close the trial ,I been a savage kid & wild
Them dumb niggas be kidding while
We grindin' hard ain't no time  to smile
You might also like
Time to hit hard  y'all be fucking with the wrong kid
Time to hit hard  y'all be fucking with the wrong kid
Traveling through dimension call it Rick & Morty
Traveling through dimension call it Rick & Morty
Time to hit hard  y'all be fucking with the wrong kid
Time to hit hard  y'all be fucking with the wrong kid
I be droppin' bomb now I'm wanted like a terrorist
I be droppin' bomb now I'm wanted like a terrorist

"I refuse to follow those rules the society has set up
In a way  they van control people with low self esteem"

I know what to do ain't no need  to panic
What we smoking  and selling the weed all organic
Levitating  all across the house we faded
I tryna get high till I'm so dehydrated
Waiting for my falls hem haters downgrading
Been drinking like sparrow and balling like Brady
Bissh are you ready  ? let me number  fo' calling Ricky
Love kinda wicked
I been dreaming bout some brain in a gatti
Never moving  backwards  I'm born in the gutter
Blunts in the air grindin' evryday till we fucking billionaires
Grab a bottle start to wave in the air
You blind to fact but my niggas gon stare
You talk on my back like a crapy bitch
We throw you out like some dusty shit
All my shit dope  ain't  no other words
Jane smoking hot and she wana flirt
Blueberry cheese and that fucking purp
Sippin' so hard  bitch I'm gonna burp
Starting to black out the red alert
Go girl go crazy take off ya shirt
We want to see titties and shorter squirts
Gazing at hoes like we bout to murk
Been falling in love with the liquor
My bitch a bottle I  lick her
I'm the one to contain her no other contenders
Wild for the night till we fucking outrageous
I woke up the neighbors  they mad as shit
Fuck what they say they can call the police
I bury the threats sarcophagus
Until 8 am I fucking ain't stopping this

Time to hit hard  y'all be fucking with the wrong kid
Time to hit hard  y'all be fucking with the wrong kid
Traveling through dimension call it Rick & Morty
Traveling through dimension call it Rick & Morty
Time to hit hard  y'all be fucking with the wrong kid
Time to hit hard  y'all be fucking with the wrong kid
I be droppin' bomb now I'm wanted like a terrorist
I be droppin' bomb now I'm wanted like a terrorist

"What matters is,you know,the people who are sparked by
And the people who are like offended by
It doesn't fucking matter,fuck you. You know it's like
Because It's about motivating the doers
And anyone that want to sit around and talk shit
They're taking too much time talking shit about it
Instead of getting up off  their ass and follow their dreams
Because I'm here to follow my dreams"Embed
