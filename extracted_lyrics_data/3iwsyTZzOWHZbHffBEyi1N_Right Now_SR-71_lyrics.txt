10 ContributorsRight Now Lyrics
She clings to me like cellophane
Fake plastic submarine
Slowly driving me insane
But now that's over
So what if the sex was great
Just a temporary escape
Another thing I grew to hate
But now that's over

Why, why do you always kick me when I'm high?
Knock me down till we see eye to eye
Figured her out I know she
May not be Miss Right, she'll do right now
She'll do right now

I used to hang on every word
Each lie was more absurd
Kept me so insecure
But now that's over
She taught me how to trust
And to believe in us
And then she taught me how to cuss
That bitch, it's over
You know I used to be such a nice boy
You might also like
Why, why do you always kick me when I'm high?
Knock me down till we see eye to eye
Figured her out I know she
May not be Miss Right, she'll do right now


She clings to me like cellophane
Fake plastic submarine
She's driving me insane
But now that's over

Why, why do you always kick me when I'm high?
Knock me down till we see eye to eye
Figured her out I know she
May not be Miss Right, she'll do right now

She'll do right now
Right now
Oh, right now
(Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah, ah)1Embed
