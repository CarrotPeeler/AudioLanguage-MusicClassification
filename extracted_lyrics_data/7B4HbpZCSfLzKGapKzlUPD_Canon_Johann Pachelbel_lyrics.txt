1 ContributorTheme Song (Pachelbel Canon) Lyrics(A kitschy orchestration of the "Pachelbel Canon" begins)
(As it continues to play:)

(tense)
Hey, Jocko? Could you turn the monitor down a bit?

You got it
(Volume of the piece lowers)

(sighs)
Thanks

The mikes are off, aren't they, Jocko?

Does Smokey the Bear wear a hat? You worry too much, Prof: I always turn them off, right as the music starts

Hey, no offense
You done with the log?

Just about. By the way, I'm not coming in until late tomorrow, so if you wanna make a list of the pieces for the show, we can leave it on Annie Sue's desk and she'll pull them in the morning

Okey-dokey
(pause)

Okay. I'm not handling this

What do you mean, Blondie?

I mean, I'm not sure
...I'm not sure I'm going to make it

Make what, Blond, are you alright?

I mean-
...I mean, make it through this piece. This piece wasn't written by Johann Pachelbel. It was written by the Marquis de Sade

Hey, Blondie, you can make it, it's less than six minutes long, and we're alre-

Maybe you should, uh-

Maybe I should jump out the window

No, maybe you should step out into the hall. Or hey, you could leave and go home!

I'm supposed to do the sign-off

One of us can do it

Just 'cause it was assigned to you, I mean, it doesn't really make any difference-

Hey! All I need is for Grumschtat to have another reason to fire me!

So go out into the hall, or downstairs: one of us can come and get you when it's time!
Blondie? How 'bout it?

Want some gum?

Yeah
(takes gum)
Thanks
(pause)
Is all of Pachelbel's music published?

Well, I don't know if it's all still in print, but I think it was, you know-

So it wouldn't do any good to burn the original manuscripts?

(laughs)
No, Blondie, it wouldn't do any good

Even if you could get your hands on them!

I bet I could, if I wanted to
(pause)

(voice wavering)
I...

We didn't have any PSA's tonight, did we?

Oops! We were supposed to do one, but I forgot it

No big deal
(pause)

(suddenly screeching)
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

BLONDIE! BLONDIE! TAKE IT EASY!
GRAB A HOLD OF HER, JOCKO! Let me see if I can get the gum out of her mouth!
Blondie, calm down! Blondie, you've got to stop screaming!
Okay, Blondie, I hate to do this!!
(puts his hand over her mouth)

(as she continues to moan loudly)
All right. That's better. Just take it easy. Relax

Aw, man!

Now, Blondie... if I take my hand away from your mouth... will you promise not to scream?
Okay, here goes-

AAAAAAAAAAAAA-

BLONDIE-
(Blondie kicks Jocko)

OUUUUUUUUUUUUUCH, OWWWWWW-

We're gonna have to tie up her feet!

With what, there's no rope in here!!

Unwind that Mannheim Dabwalze tape over there, use that! And then you'd better call the ambulance!
(as a muffled Blondie continues screaming and growling)
Now, Blondie, you're going to have to stop it! If you don't stop screaming, Blondie, I'm gonna turn the monitor up full blast!
(Blondie's cries become more panicked)
All the way up to eleven, Blondie! HERE I AM, REACHING FOR THE KNOB-
(Silence)
Okay!

(on the phone in the background)
Yes, we need the ambulance out here at the WTWP studios right away-

(as Jocko continues talking in the background)
Now, Blondie... we're going to get you out of here just as fast as we can, and you'll be able to get some rest... everything's gonna be just fine

(in the background)
-got trauma or something. Well, I guess an overdose of Pachelbel! Okay, fast as you can, right?

She's fainted. We've got to get her downstairs, Jocko

Let's wait until the ambulance comes

 she could start...
Hey, Jocko, look out the window! Who's that getting out of his car?

Never seen him before in my life

Me neither - but five will get you ten his name is John Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt

(nervous)
Uh oh, he does not look like a happy camper...

We're gonna have to take her out the window and down the fire escape

Somebody has to do the sign-off, Prof! If we don't do that, we're in deep doo-doo with the FCC, not just Grumschtat! Look,  I can get her down the fire escape myself: why don't you stay here, lock the studio door-

I'm gonna do that right now-

-and then at 11:59:50, do the sign-off

But Jocko, I don't know how to turn the station off!

Don't worry about it, it's automated! Look, Prof, here's all you have to do: turn the mikes on, read the sign-off copy - it's tacked up on the wall there, right next to the "Far Side" cartoons? And then the transmitter will shut itself off at exactly midnight!

Well...
(Suddenly, someone starts banging on the studio door)

That's it! Blondie and I have to go now!

Let me get the window!
(Jocko starts to climb out with Blondie)

You'd better lock it, too, after we're out!

Be careful!
WAIT A MINUTE, HERE'S HER SHOES!
(shuts window)
Oh, brother!
(at the man pounding on the door, as an ambulance siren starts to get closer to the studio)
JOCKO IS NOT HERE! HE IS NOT IN THE BUILDING! CAN YOU HEAR ME? JOCK HAS LEFT THE BUILDING FOR THE DAY!
(The pounding stops)
Okay!
Okay, okay, okay, okay... now, let's see, turn the mikes on - oh, they're already on
OH, NO, THEY'RE ALREADY ON
Well...
