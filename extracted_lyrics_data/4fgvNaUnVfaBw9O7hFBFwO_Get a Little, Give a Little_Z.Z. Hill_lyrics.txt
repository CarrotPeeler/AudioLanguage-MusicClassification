1 ContributorGet a Little, Give a Little Lyrics
I’d like to see talk to fellas a little
Fellas if you think I’m trying to guide you
Just ask that lady there beside you
You see it’s an old fact
That women don’t have trouble
Trying to get a man to sock it to her
But she do have trouble trying to get him
To open up his pocket to her
If you wanna hear him holler
All you got to do is ask him for a dollar

Whether she’s a nurse, secretary
Waitress or clerk
She can be a typist, teacher
Beautician or any kind of work
When she pays a babysitter
A car no? and a wren?
And got a few things she needs
For herself, there’s nothing left

She’s gotta try to keep herself
Looking neat
She’s gotta buy clothes and food
For her kids to eat
They don’t show it
If they walk down the street
Some of those women
Don’t have a thing at home to eat
You might also like
So when you get a little, give a little
You don’t necessarily have to be her man
If she’s kind enough to let you love her
You shouldn’t mind giving her a little help

Now fellas, you know it’s wrong for us
To make love to them women all the time
If they ask us for 20 dollars
To buy their woman a pair of shoes
The first thing we say
Go ask the daddy dame, I ain’t

Nobody’s fool and this
You can believe
But I help my woman
When she’s in need
Where can she go if she
Can’t come to a man?
To dry away her tears, to help pay her bills
Or just to understand

So when you get a little, give a little
If she gives you all of her, and you accept
If she’s kind enough to let you love her
You shouldn’t mind giving her a little help
When you get a little, give a little
You don’t necessarily, you don’t necessarily have to be her man
If she’s kind enough to let you love her
You shouldn’t mind giving her a helping handEmbed
