2 ContributorsGive It Back LyricsIf I give you my love
Are you gonna give it back?
If I give you my love, tell me
Now, are you gonna give it back?
And when I give you my loving, honey
Can you handle that?
When I give you my loving, baby
Can you handle that, well?
You're on my mind
Wondering all the time
I just want to know
If you're mine
When I give my loving
Want yours in return
If not, don't you waste my time
If I give you my love
Are you gonna give it back?
When I give you just a little of my love
Now, can you handle that?
Oh baby, oh baby, can't you see
You're the only one
Make me feel so free
