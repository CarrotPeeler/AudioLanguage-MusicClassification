2 ContributorsNo Big â€™Ting LyricsCan't seem to sew a single hole in my pocket
Lord, I've tried
Yeah, money talks, I should know
Mine always says, "Goodbye"
And I know that money can't buy love
I've parked my speedboat next to some
This jungleness badboy sufferer
Yes, I have
Price of an education
Least now I know it's no big 'ting
No big thing
Time for these bootheels to be wanderin'
Towards those burning sands
A genetical testimony
That white boys simply cannot dance
Can't let that little stuff trip you up
I'll take the fattest chance
And now I've got the answer
To a question no one asked
So, here's two rules I got for you
Great ones for living under
First, don't sweat the little shit
Second is, there ain't no other
You might also likeTattoos, scars and missing parts
And all the rich have ever proven
Is they are to life
What American Bandstand is to the theory of evolution
Price of an education
Least now I know it's no big 'ting
No big thing
Who needs the aggravation?
It all adds up to no big 'ting
No big thing
Stamps in my passport
Now they're Polaroids and drinkin' stories
And I've got some good ones now
It's getting harder to ignore me
Now I'm believing half the reason
Just for leavin' is coming home
What'd you see and who'd ya do
And what'ya done?
I'll be lounging on the Rivera
Rivera couch that is
When you're surfin' 40 footers
You don't need no tricks
The future's looking brighter
With every beer that I pour in me
But even this I have to say
With absolute uncertainty
Too much exasperation
Least now I know it's no big thing
No big thing
Price of an education
Least now I know it's no big thing
No big thing
(No big thing)
(No big thing)
They finally tore the old schoolhouse down
Forever gone my history
Yeah, what used to be
And now when I go drivin' by
And point where I used to go to school
I'm pointing at an A&P
All I'm leaving when it's time to go
Is my old blue jeans and gold brass zippo
Teach in turn
All these secret things I've learned
And all I got from history
And careful how you take it
Is recognize the same mistake
Every time you make it
Price of an education
Least now I know it's no big 'ting
No big thing
Who needs the aggravation?
It all adds up to no big 'ting
No big thingEmbed
