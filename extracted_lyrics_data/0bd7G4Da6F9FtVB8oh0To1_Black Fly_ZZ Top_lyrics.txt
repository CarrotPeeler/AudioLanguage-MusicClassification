Black fly buzzing, buzzing around
Black fly flying from town to town
Black fly looking around and around
What's he going to do when he finds her?
He got the mojo working overtime
Making it, laying it on the line
Chasing his honey with a honeysuckle vine
Who's so lucky and gets to kiss her?

Black fly, that's right
Black fly, that's right

Flying round looking for a black cat bone
Flying with John the conqueror showing
Messing around with a honey-bee
Will she kiss him or sting him, what's it gonna be?

Black fly, that's right
Black fly, that's right

Black fly buzzing, buzzing around
Black fly flying from town to town
Black fly zzzzz-ng all around
Fly gonna fly when he find her

Black fly, that's right
Black fly, that's right
Black fly, that's right
Black fly, that's right
Black fly, yeah that's alrightEmbed
