4 ContributorsBeer Can LyricsYou were the filter in the wall through the air I was breathing in
Open the depths of your heart to keep me warm when I was freezing then
I was sleeping in and wake up and find you again
Like something I was dreaming of
I couldn't shake the feeling of
Since I've been awake
And those nights I was drinking alone, did you judge me then?
You turn the stereo on to find me shaking out at 4am
It's not worth mentioning
I guess I always knew
That in the end you
You'd watch me when I fall (Watch me as I fall)
Watch me as I fall (Watch me as I fall)
Watch me as I fall (Watch me as I fall)
I guess I always knew
That in the end you
I want to rip you apart
I want to fix you again
I want to bring you back
I want to watch you die again
I want to rip you apart
I want to fix you again
I want to bring you back
I want to watch you die again
You might also likeAt least you had the decency
When the cracks in the wall opened up
You sent your friend out for my blood
Somethings should be left unsaid
Somethings are better undead
I want to rip you apart
I want to fix you again
I want to bring you back
I want to watch you die again
I want to rip you apart
I want to fix you again
I want to bring you back
I want to watch you die
(Watch me as I fall) Watch me as I fall
(Watch me as I fall) Watch me as I fall
(Watch me as I fall) Watch me as I fall
(Watch me as I fall) Watch me as I fallEmbed
