1 ContributorBeat LyricsNot an afterlife
Full of aliens, no
No philosophy
No way of thinking
Instead of diving in
Spin around just 1ooking
A we11 travelled path
Beside the road
And when you hear the bell
You can always trust yourself
Pointless to explain
Infinite no-thing
Gently flowing down
Observe the hologram
Advancing world retreats
Away from grasping hands
Dejected scientists
Mystics and garbage men
Asses back in line
And start it all again
If you hear a bell
There's nothing left to tell
Just before you can explain...
