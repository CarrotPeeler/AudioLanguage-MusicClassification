2 ContributorsCaution (Do Not Stop on Tracks) (Studio Session, November 3, 1965) Lyrics

I went down to see a gypsy woman
I wanna find out, oh, what's wrong with me
I said please, please, please help me out
What's wrong with me?
Alright
Well, she looked at me and said "Man"
She said, "Man, why you here?
All you need, all you need, all you need
All you need is a mojo hand, mojo hand
All you need, a mojo hand"
That's what I'm gon' do, get myself a mojo hand
And everything will be alright
Everything will be alrightYou might also likeEmbed
