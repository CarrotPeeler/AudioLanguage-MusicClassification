3 ContributorsSupervision Until Death LyricsTortured by the agony of self-laceration
Full of pain and fear
My sense of self-preservation keeps me alive
The whole way of life paved by affliction and danger
More and more I recognize the cruelty of reality
Reality the greatest plot of life one walks
Talks
Sees
Breathes
But doesn't live
No
Rather serve the growing edifice
That control sour so
Called life
Death gives way to the living
Straight into freedom
Way out of this edifice
Everyone a brick in this stonework
And day by day more people live in it
Hour by hour their power rises
And inevitably steals our breathYou might also likeEmbed
