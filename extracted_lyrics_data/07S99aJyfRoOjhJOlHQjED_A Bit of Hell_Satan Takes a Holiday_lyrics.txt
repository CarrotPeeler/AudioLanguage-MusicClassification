2 ContributorsA Bit of Hell LyricsI wanna move you to the backseat
Baby come on
I wanna give you a bit of hell
Cause that's where you're going
I wanna move you to the backseat
I'm gonna give you a run
I wanna give it to you
I wanna stare at the sun
I wanna howl at the moon
Come on get your body in sync
I wanna lead you in a groove
I wanna move you to the backseat
Baby come on
I wanna give you a bit of hell
Cause that's where you're going
I wanna move you to the backseat
Baby come on
Im gonna bring you a gun
Im gonna give it to you
Im gonna talk to you softly
Gonna make you choose
Come on get your butt in the blitz
Its gonna shake you to the bone
I wanna move you to the backseat
Baby come on
I wanna give you a bit of hell
Cause that's where you're going
I wanna move you to the backseat
Baby come onYou might also likeEmbed
