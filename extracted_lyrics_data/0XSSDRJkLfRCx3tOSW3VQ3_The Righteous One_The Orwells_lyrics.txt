I don't have a care
Double, double, double, double, double, double, double dare
Falling down the stairs, ooh
But it's not fair
Don't cut your hair
It's not nice to stare
But it's not fair, let down your hair
Oh, I don't know where?
Where, where, where, where?
I don't know where, where, where
Where to go
Smoke in the air
I don't have a care
Double, double, double, double, double, double, double dare
Falling down the stairs, ooh
But it's not fair
Don't cut your hair
It's not nice to stare
But it's not fair, let down your hair
Oh, I don't know where?
Where, where, where, where?
I don't know where, where, where
Where to go

Care, care, care, care
Care, care, care, care
