I will make a monster
Bring your friends to suck blood
Spines and chills, were laughed at
Mistakes are made
In times red
Last days are light
Like she said
Six feet straight down
The eyes close
Deep in cold earth
The hands met
God knows the sun
Will burn you
Give the lies time
They come true
These bright blue skies
Surround us
Worst version of
Our own life

The eyes close
Deep in cold earth
The hands met
Mistakes are made
In times red
Last days are light
Like she said
Six feet straight down
The eyes close
Deep in cold earth
