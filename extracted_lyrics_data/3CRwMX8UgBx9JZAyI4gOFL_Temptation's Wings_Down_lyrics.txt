7 ContributorsTemptationâ€™s Wings Lyrics
I feel the pressure, it lightens
To judge this spirit of mine
To be like the judgment
To be the king that is left behind
To hell with I miss you
I said I'd do it alone
Ripping apart from you
A broken vision to call my own

I gave my life to reason
So now I'm watching my life go
My wit is falling apart
I can't shake temptation's wings
I can't shake temptation's wings

I bury my head with frustration
And I look at others and wonder why
I'm feeding my cancer
A broken vision that stole my sight

I gave my life to reason
So now I'm watching my life go
My wit is falling apart
I can't shake temptation's wings
I can't shake temptation's wings
I can't shake temptation's wings
I can't temptation's wings
You might also like
Temptation's wings
Temptation's wings, temptations wings

Temptation's wings
Temptation's wings got me pale
Temptation's wings
Temptation's wings got me pale
Why? Why? Why?
Temptation's wings got me pale
Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why?Embed
