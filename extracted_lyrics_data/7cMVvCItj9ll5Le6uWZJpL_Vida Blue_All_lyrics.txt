6 ContributorsVida Blue Lyrics
I'm feeling cold today
Frozen to the core
I need some inspiration
To pull me from the floor

Take me down the road
To a place I've never been before
Open up my eyes
Show me colors that I've never seen
Open up your mouth
Give me perfect words I've never heard
I'm ready now, let's go
Burn my world a southpaw curve
Fast and hard like Vida Blue

I've lived a lot of every place
Nowhere I'd call home
The look in every stranger's face
Tells me I'm alone

Take me down the road
To a place I've never been before
Open up my eyes
Show me colors that I've never seen
Open up your mouth
Give me perfect words I've never heard
I'm ready now, let's go
Burn my world a southpaw curve
Fast and hard like Vida Blue
You might also like

Take me down the road
To a place I've never been before
Open up my eyes
Show me colors that I've never seen
Open up your mouth
Give me perfect words I've never heard
I'm ready now, let's go
Burn my world a southpaw curve
Fast and hard like Vida BlueEmbed
