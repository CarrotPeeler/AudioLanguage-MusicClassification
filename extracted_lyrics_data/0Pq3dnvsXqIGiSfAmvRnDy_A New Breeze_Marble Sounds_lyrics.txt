3 ContributorsA New Breeze LyricsI can feel a new breeze
That will ease our minds
It's a different heartbeat
And the timing feels right
Gonna feed this hunger
Gonna quench my thirst
Though I know indulgence
It could make it much worse
We have talked it over
Cause the prize ain't small
But it will be worth it after all
We can cross the ocean
Take it day by day
We can stop our watches
And we'll never be late
We can have a daughter
We can have a son
We don't know tomorrow
But we'll do what seems right after allYou might also likeEmbed
