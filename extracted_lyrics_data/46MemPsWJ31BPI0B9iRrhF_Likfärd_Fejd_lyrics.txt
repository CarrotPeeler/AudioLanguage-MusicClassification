1 ContributorFeed On Me LyricsRest your head in my arms
I'll protect you from harm
Feed on me
And I'll feed on you
Feed on me
Yeah
Dry your tears in my hair
Close your eyes I'll be there
Feed on me
And I'll feed on you
Feed on me
And i'll feed on you
Feed on me
Yeah
In the morning you awake
Nothing left for you to fake
Cross the dreams before my eyes
Wash your hands the dirt's inside
Drench the darkness in my heart
To reveal the shadow that I am
That I am
You might also likeSacrifice my feelings
To give your life some meaning
Feed on me
And I'll feed on you
Feed on me
And I'll feed on you
Feed on me
And I'll feed on you
Feed on me
And I'll feed on youEmbed
