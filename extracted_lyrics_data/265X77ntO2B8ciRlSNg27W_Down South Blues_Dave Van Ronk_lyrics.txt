2 ContributorsDown South Blues LyricsI'm just sittin' here thinking 'bout dear old sunny Tennessee
I'm just sittin' here thinking 'bout dear old sunny Tennessee
You know, I'm wonderin' if my baby is waiting there for me
I'm goin' where the Northern crosses the L&N
I'm goin' where the Northern crosses the L&N
You know, I'll catch me a freight train, I'm goin' back home again
I'm goin' back South where it's warm the whole year round
I'm goin' back South where it's warm the whole year round
You know, I'll be so glad when my train pulls up in town
You know, I wonder, will a matchbox hold my clothes?
I wonder, will a matchbox hold my clothes?
I ain't got so many matches; I got so far to go
Ohh, yeah, me weepin', ma
Ohh, yeah, me weepin', ma
You gonna call my name, gal; yes, I'll be gone
I'm just sittin' here thinking 'bout dear old sunny Tennessee
I'm just sittin' here thinking 'bout dear old sunny Tennessee
You know, I'm wonderin' if my baby is waiting there for meEmbed
