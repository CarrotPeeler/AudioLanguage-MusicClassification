3 ContributorsLittle Girl in Rome LyricsI got a letter this mornin'
From that girl in Rome
Said she got somethin' for me
She gonna bring it back home
I got a letter this morning
I went down to the depot
I act like some child
Said to the ticket agent
"What train must I ride?
Got the worried blues, I
I can't be satisfied."
Well I'm goin' away-away to
Worry you off my mind
'Cause you keep me worried
And bothered all the time
I'm goin' away-away to
I got something to tell you
Just before I go
It ain't nothin', baby
Turn your lamp down low
I got something to tell you, before I go
I went down to the railroad
I looked down the track
Thought about my little good girl
Come a-easin' on back
You might also likeYonder come my baby
Comin' down the line
With her headlights just shinin' like
Coaches all behind
Yonder come my baby
Well, I had one good girl
She strayed away-away
I didn't think my little good girl
Do me this a-way
I didn't think my baby
Do me this a-way
Well, if I could holler like a mountain jack
I would go up on the mountain
And call my baby back
If I could holler like a mountain jack
Mama, she caught the Southern
Daddy rode the blinds
She said "Baby, you can't quit me
Ain't no need of you tryin'"
Said "Baby, you can't quit me
Ain't no need of tryin'"
I got a letter this mornin'
From that girl in Rome
Said she got somethin' for me
She gonna bring it back homeEmbed
