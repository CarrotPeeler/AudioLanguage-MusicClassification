She was a red-hot hoocie coocher
She was the roughest toughest frail
But Minnie had a heart as big as a whale
Hodehodehodeho (Hodehodehodeho)
Hodehidehidehi (Hodehidehidehi)
Hedehedehedehe (Hedehedehedehe)
Whoaaa (Whooa)
She messed around with a bloke named Smokie
She loved him though he was a tad cokey
He took her down to Chinatown
And showed her how to kick that gong around
Hidehidehidehi (Hidehidehidehi)
Oye yoy yoy (oye yoy yoy)
Aye yayaya (aye yayaya)
Hawaa Haha (Hawaa Haha)
She had a dream about the king of Sweden
He gave her things that she was needin'
He gave her a home built of gold and steel
A diamond car with them platinum wheels
Ahidehidehidehidehidehidehi (Hidehidehidehidehidehidehi)

Each meal she ate was a dozen courses
He had a million dollars worth of nickels and dimes
She sat and counted them a million times
