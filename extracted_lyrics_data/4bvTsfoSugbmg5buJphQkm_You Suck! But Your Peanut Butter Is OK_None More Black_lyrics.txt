3 ContributorsYou Suck! But Your Peanut Butter Is OK LyricsWould you exist without all the fists
The music clenched for you?
You're dressed up like a full-bodied anarchist
Right down to your views
It's more than points that break, there's no threat, little promise
To your life, so you take it out on music
Your talk is cheap and I don't want to hear it
Go preach to your fucking choir
You piss and moan for what's no longer your own
You're pissing on the motives of my friends
I understand what you're saying, what you're going through
But your point never ends
It's more than points that break, there's no threat, little promise
To your life, so you take it out on music
Your talk is cheap and I don't want to hear it
Go preach to your fucking choir
The ticket price, the songs that you write
We've got our eyes on you
The internet is just a minute away
And I'm telling on you
It's more than points that break, there's no threat, little promise
To your life, so you take it out on music
Your talk is cheap and I don't want to hear it
Go preach to your fucking choir

The music clenches for you?Embed
