2 ContributorsPhiladelphia LyricsRaindrops falling softly as I walk on down the road
Neon lights flicker reflecting on my leather coat
A black guy passes me by, he's looking kinda high
When I'm reaching for a smile, I see that strange look in his eye
Here I am in Philadelphia
And I'm walking in the rain
You're out there in Compton
Do you still remember my name?
I couldn't hear what he said but I suddenly realized
Thousands thoughts go through my head while his steps they follow mine
A woman must be crazy to be out this time at night
Unless she's looking for some business, unless she's feeling real uptight
Here I am in Philadelphia
And I'm walking in the rain
You're out there in Compton
Do you still remember my name?
Here I am in Philadelphia
And I'm walking in the rain
You're out there in Compton
Do you still remember my name?
And here I'm standing at the station waiting for my train to come
When that dude gave me a look made me wonder what I'd done
A woman must be crazy to be out this time at night
Unless she's looking for some trouble, unless she's out of her mind
And here I am in Philadelphia
And I'm walking in the rain
You're out there in Compton
Do you still remember my name?
Here I am in Philadelphia
And I'm walking in the rain
You're out there in Compton
Do you still remember my name?
Do you baby?
Do you remember?
Tell me baby
Do you remember?
Remember my, remember my
Remember my name?You might also likeEmbed
