1 ContributorStargazer (The Summoning) LyricsDarkened necropolis, midnight sharp
Nobody else will see
A six foot dig, open the casket, there she
Waits for me
Her lifeless body, cracks and splinters
As I start to raise her
In eagerness I carry on
In lust for my Stargazer
Deterioration, rotting flesh
Violation of a fossilised wench
A degrading thought to seduce a corpse
Dry reaching from a horrid stench
Parting the thighs, a sickening crack
Festering hole open wide
Enter my partner, close my eyes
So cold and dry when inside
Ignore the sounds that fill my head, the
Crunching of flesh as I thrust
Sweat profuses my body bare
Driven by bizarre lusts
Run my tongue across her mouth
Formaldehyde I taste
Dislodge my member from her hole
And head below the waist
As I feast between her thighs, her throat
Emits a deafening cry
A filthy claw grabs my head's back
And rams it up her rotting crackYou might also likeEmbed
