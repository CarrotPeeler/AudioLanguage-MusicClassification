Who's side are you on?
You’ve been weak for too long and its
Time you are strong
Green raven blonde
Sparkling on my eyes
I couldn't climb a mountain
And never found out why
I should remote myself now
I couldn't contact somehow
Green raven blonde
Green raven blonde
I should remote myself now
I couldn’t contact somehowYou might also likeEmbed
