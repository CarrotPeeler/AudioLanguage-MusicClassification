4 ContributorsWaking Up Beside You Lyrics
I've been so alone for so long
Forgotten by the world
Forgotten to myself

Your effervescent eyes have awakened me
And brushed the dust away
But I knew you'd never stay

So I memorized the color of your eyes
As I lost myself inside you
And I memorized the way our legs entwined
As I drifted off beside you

I miss, God I miss
Waking up beside you

At night I cling to you
I'm so afraid
Afraid the day will come
And I'll wake and find you gone
You might also like
But you promised that you'd not abandon me
And then kissed my fears away
But I woke up to that day

But I memorized the way our eyes would meet
Reflected in the bathroom mirror
And I memorized your naked silhouette
As you slowly brushed your hair

I miss, God I miss
Waking up beside you

I've been so alone for so long
Forgot how much it hurts
To wake up so alone

But I'd memorized how warm your body felt
As you lay half asleep beside me
And I memorized the way the sunlight filled the room
And played upon your body
I miss, God I miss
Waking up beside you
I miss, God I miss
Waking up beside youEmbed
