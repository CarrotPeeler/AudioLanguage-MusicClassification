8 ContributorsRed Stars Lyrics
Best of cruel intentions
Finding what they fail to mention
No truth, all pretension
Raise your hand to get attention

You give it, we take it
You build it, we break it
You sign and we erase it
You feel it, we fake it

It's my red star (don't steal it)
It's my red star (can't let go)
It's my red star (conceal it)
It's my red star, oh no

Wasted education
Celebrating imitation
Misplaced admiration
Speaking for a generation

You give it, we take it
You build it, we break it
You sign and we erase it
You feel it, we fake it

It's my red star (don't steal it)
It's my red star (can't let go)
It's my red star (conceal it)
It's my red star, oh no


It's my red star (don't steal it)
It's my red star (can't let go)
It's my red star (conceal it)
It's my red star, oh no2Embed
