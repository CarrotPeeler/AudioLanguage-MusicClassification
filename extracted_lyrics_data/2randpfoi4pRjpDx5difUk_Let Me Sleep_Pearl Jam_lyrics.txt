8 ContributorsLet Me Sleep Lyrics
One, two, three, four

Cold wind blows on the soles of my feet
Heaven knows nothing of me
I'm lost, nowhere to go

Oh, when I was a kid, oh, how magic it seemed
Oh, please let me sleep, it's Christmas time

Flowered winds was where I lived
Thought you burned, not froze for your sins
Oh, I'm so tired, and cold

Oh, when I was a kid, oh, how magic it seemed
Oh, please let me sleep, it's Christmas time

Uh, oh, when I was a kid, oh, how magic it seemed
Oh, please let me sleep, it's Christmas time
Oh, oh, and I, if I was a kid, oh, how magic it seemed
Oh, please let me dream, it's Christmas timeYou might also likeEmbed
