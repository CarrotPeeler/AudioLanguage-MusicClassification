1 ContributorGalaxy LyricsNow I know I could be wrong
There seems to be a way to linger on
Will we stumble will we phone
I feel, I feel down and live
Oh yeah
Though I know I should be strong
I feel that I'll be weak and you'll be gone
Though I know I should believe
I feel, I feel down and live
Though I know I should be strong
I feel that I'll be weak and you'll be gone
Though I know I should believe
I believe that we will see
Tomorrow is the day for you and me
In the end we will be free
We're stars in love galaxy
