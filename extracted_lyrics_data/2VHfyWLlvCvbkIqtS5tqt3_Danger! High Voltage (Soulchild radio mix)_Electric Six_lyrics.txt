2 ContributorsDanger! High Voltage (Soulchild radio mix) LyricsFire in the disco
Fire in the Taco Bell
Fire in the disco
Fire in the gates of hell
Don't you want to know how we keep starting fires?
It's my desire, it's my desire, it's my desire
Don't you want to know how we keep starting fires?
It's my desire, it's my desire, it's my desire
Danger, danger, high voltage
When we touch, when we kiss
Danger, danger, high voltage
When we touch, when we kiss, when we touch
Danger, danger, high voltage
When we touch, when we kiss
Danger, danger, high voltage
When we touch, when we kiss, when we touch, when we kiss
Don't you want to know how we keep starting fires?
It's my desire, it's my desire
Don't you want to know how we keep starting fires?
It's my desire, it's my desire
Danger, danger, high voltage
When we touch, when we kiss
Danger, danger, it's high voltage
When we touch, when we kiss, when we touch
