And everyone needs some time to be free
Loving you goes all around
I need to be me
The summers gone now
The summers gone
(The summers gone)
The summers gone now
The summers gone
(The summers gone)
I thought I'd use you
Turn your back
Keep on walking
Turn your back
The summers gone now
The summers gone
(The summers gone)
The summers gone now
The summers gone
(The summers gone)You might also likeEmbed
