1 ContributorFor the Love of It LyricsSimplification of skank beat
Free stylin' ourselves while we jam
Stripping it back to the roots, version
Nothing else treats me like you do
We move to the music
Pushing and pulling ourselves
Feeling the drum and bass
That's why we do what we do
Unite the people we of the land
Re-light the fires we burn again
Stripping it back to the roots, version
Nothing else takes me like you do
Version, we do it for the love of itYou might also likeEmbed
