4 ContributorsLove Never Came Lyrics
I’ve waited here
Between the light and the rain
Hiding in the cracks in the walls
Trying to break my fall
As I lose you again

And you’re gone
As though love never came
As though love turns and leaves me here again
I’ve waited here
Holding on to pieces of the past
But nothing, nothing makes sense any more
I can’t seem to push us back together
I thought we’d be forever
But you’re gone

As though love never came
As though love turns and leaves me here again
As though love never came
I guess love always leaves me here
You leave me here

But I run from the shadow
The darkness always hides behinds the sun
I’m still holding on
In silence and the emptiness
The darkness seems to leave when you’re gone
But I’m still holding on
But I’m still holding on
You might also like
As though love never came
As though love turns and leaves me here again
As though love never came
As though love turns and leaves me here
You leave me hereEmbed
