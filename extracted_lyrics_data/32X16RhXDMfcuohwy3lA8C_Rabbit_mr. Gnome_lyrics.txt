Don't you rush him like that
Rabbit lives up in my head
Wake to find that I've been dead
Times it hops from side to side
Times it picks a place to hide
Rabbit sleeping in my brain
Wishing things would stay the same
Slowly we become alive
Me and rabbit now decide...
Here I lay, sea is calm
Just obey, will they always call?
Sold my eyes, held in palm
Sold my heart to belong
Cut back, still the same
One light will remainYou might also likeEmbed
