8 ContributorsCircle of the Tyrants Lyrics
Uh

The battle is over, and the sand's drunken the blood
All what there remains is the bitterness of delusion

The circle of the tyrants

The immortality of the Gods sits at their side
As they leave the walls behind to reach the jewels gleam

The circle of the tyrants, uh

The days have come when the steel will rule
And upon his head, a crown of gold
Your hand wields the might, the tyrant's the precursor
You carry the will as the morning is near (As the morning is near)

I sing the ballads of victory and defeat
I hear the tales of frozen mystery
Your hand wields the might, the tyrant's the precursor
You carry the will, as the morning is near

Uh

The new kingdoms rise by the circle of the tyrants
In the land of darkness, the warrior, that was me
Grotesque glory, none will ever see them fall
And hunts and wars are like everlasting shadows

Where the winds cannot reach, the tyrant's might was born
And often I look back with tears in my eyes
Grotesque glory, none will ever see them fall
And hunts and wars are like everlasting shadows (Shadows)

The days have comeEmbed
