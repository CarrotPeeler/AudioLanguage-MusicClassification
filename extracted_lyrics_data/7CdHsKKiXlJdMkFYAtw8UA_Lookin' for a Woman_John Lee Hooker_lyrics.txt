3 ContributorsJohn Lee Hooker for President Lyrics
When I first came to town, people
I was walkin ' down Pennsylvania Avenue
I heard a lot people talking 'bout the White House
I decided I'd drop in there that night
And when I got there I said, "Man, what's shakin'?"
They said, "Look, man, you can't come in here
This is where the President hang out, what you want?"
I said, "Look, man, I'm John Lee Hooker, I sing the blues"
They said the President don't have time for the blues
I said, "Look, man, everybody got to have the blues sometime
Don't matter where you're from or where you're at"

So I decided to make a run for President, uh-huh
Yeah, I know everyone got the blues 'cause I'm in touch wit' 'em when I sing
It's my life
I got the number one record in Detroit right now
And it's called Boom Boom
Yeah, it tells a tremendous story, these lyrics are something else
I want you to dig it and pick up on it
And every time you hear Boom Boom, that's a dollar change
I don't need yo money 'cause I finance my own campaign, I ain't for sale
I keep a fat bankroll in my pocket, baby, big as a hay bale
Yes sir
You might also like
Now I want everybody to know I'm strictly copastatic
I ain't Republican or Democratic
I got a new program for the nation
It's gonna be groove time, a big sensation
Every man and woman gets one scotch, one bourbon, one beer
Three times a day if they stay cool
And little chillens gets milk, cream and alcohol
Two times a day if they stay involved in school
Now boogie chillen
Yes sir, mhm
Oh, low low, what a mighty time

Now I want nine fine lookin' women sittin' on the Supreme Court
Their big legs, their tight skirts drive me out of my mind
When I need a judgment they gonna give it to me right on time
They call me on the phone sayin', "Johnny
We disagree on which one of us you like the best"
I said, "Honey, you all equally fine under the law"
Yes sir
Now I'm sharp and up to date
Jimmy Reed, Vice President, Little Johnny Taylor, Secretary of State
I got the foreign policy numbers 444
Domestic spending goin' up, continental clothes, Stetson hats
Everybody's on the dance floor
Yes sir
All you back biters and syndicators, hear what I say
Now I ain't gonna stand for no trash talking and double dealin'
If I catch you messin' 'round the White House while I'm there
I might cut you, I might shoot you, I just don't know
And there's one point I really wanna prove
If you vote for John Lee Hooker you know you're gonna groove
Don't be fooled by the Republican, don't pity the Democratic
Vote John Lee Hooker and everything gon' be mellow, knocked out, copastatic

See us on a rainy dayEmbed
