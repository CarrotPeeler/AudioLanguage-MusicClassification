1 ContributorFlying To Mars - Original Mix Lyrics]

Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey

Thoughts are distorted, my mind is really spinning
I feel like I'm in space, should I abort this?
But like Charlie Sheen I feel I'm winning
Don't want to stay in space
And I'm flying to Mars, (Woah, woah, woah.)
I'm flying to Mars, (Yeah, yeah, yeah.)
Should stay behind, but I'm rocking my spacesuit
And I'm flying to mars. (Woah, woah, woah.)
Dada dee, dada day
You might also like
Yeah, coke tanked up to my grill
Run up in the jam so slick
Came straight out of the field
Head to the bar like "Yo"
'Cos he hooked me up on to them tings
Bang, two shots to the head
Then I drop a half G in the drink
(Dada dee, dada day.)
Look who's back in the zone
Out here we're trying to catch those thrills
Hoes set put three to the dole
You can find me by the speaker
More time I'll be by the mic
Beggar fam transmit to the either
Can we get deep in the cut or less?


We about to get loose
I'm all in my head gone like, (Woah!)
I'mma draw two more sips of the goose
So who's in the two puff pass?
Two blasts to the chest no drool
'Cos a brother's on a move heading out of space
I've been licking that rocket fuel
(Dada dee, dada day.)
Yeah and that's just the way we roam
Blazing them big fat cones
Somehow, someway we make it back home
We're raving our ways past all
No time to waste when man's in that zone
'Cos when you see me in the dance
I'm gonna drop that shit to get your head blown


I can barely move
But I can see the moon
I can see the stars behind the moon
I can see the moon
I can barely move
But I can see the moon
I can see the stars behind the moon
I can see the moon
Oh yeahEmbed
