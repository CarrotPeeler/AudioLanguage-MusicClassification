6 ContributorsBecker Lyrics
You have grown so much and now you're breaking
Every time you're laughing
It's like you're shaking
Something far outside of us connected
A faint, unseen collision
Left me bruised and hoping

So easy
Your tracks make no sound
No matter what you see
You've got to get back to being found

I felt alive like a convict out of Becker
Free beneath the grate's teeth
Flipping in the rainfall
Sometimes part of me wakes so collected
Forgetting what's expected
I walk right through a bad seam

So easy
To turn the world down
No matter what you dream
You've got to get back to being found
You might also like
That's delirium's way
It always seems so right
All the entertainment they spray
Atrocities grow trite
It brings you back again
It finds you every time
The blackest quote they spit
Into the tin can of your mind

It's so easy
To turn the world down
No matter what you dream
It's so easy
Your tracks make no sound
No matter what you see
You've got to get back to being found

It's always gonna blow your mind
It's always gonna blow your mind
It's always gonna blow her mind
It's always gonna blow your mind3Embed
