10 ContributorsDying Breed Lyrics
Round one!
I swear to God I'd do it for fun
Just a dead man walkin'
With a double-barrel shotgun
Ain't a single fucker left to fear
See their lips movin'
But I don't wanna hear

Showdown!
(I ain't backin' down from anybody)
Throw-down!
(If I don't get some space)
Lay down?
(Not in this life or another)
It's a nightmare!
(And it's not goin' away)

All I wanted was your honesty
Something more than this
Something more than me
(More than me)
Death can take me if I can't be free
I'm not like you
I'm a dying breed
You might also like
Round two!
Something you just don't wanna do
Go dancin' with the devil
Unless you're wearing my shoes
You got nerve, yeah, I'll give ya that
Watch the world crumble
While you sit on your ass?

Wake up!
(Get your head together, motherfucker)
Straight up!
(Before it's too late)
Stand up!
(Nothing ever lasts forever)
Corrupt!
(And that's how it's gonna stay)

All I wanted was your honesty
Something more than this
Something more than me
(More than me)
Death can take me if I can't be free
I'm not like you
I'm a dying breed
Rah!


All I wanted was your honesty (Honesty)
Something more than this
(More than this)
Something more than me
(More than me)
Death can take me if I can't be free
(Canâ€™t be free)
I'm not like you (Not like you)
I'm a dying breed
