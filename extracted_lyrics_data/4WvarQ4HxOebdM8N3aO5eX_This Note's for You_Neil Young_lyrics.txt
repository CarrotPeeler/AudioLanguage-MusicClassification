9 ContributorsThis Noteâ€™s for You Lyrics
Don't want no cash
Don't need no money
Ain't got no stash
This note's for you

Ain't singing for Pepsi
Ain't singing for Coke
I don't sing for nobody
Makes me look like a joke
This note's for you

Not singing for Miller
Don't sing for Bud
I won't sing for politicians
Ain't singing for Spuds
This note's for you

Don't need no cash
Don't want no money
Ain't got no stash
This note's for you

I've got the real thing
I got the real thing, baby
I got the real thing
Yeah, alrightEmbed
