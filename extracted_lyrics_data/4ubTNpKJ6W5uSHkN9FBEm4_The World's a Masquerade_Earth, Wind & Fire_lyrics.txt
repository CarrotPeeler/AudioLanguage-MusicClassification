5 ContributorsThe Worldâ€™s a Masquerade LyricsCan this world be a masquerade?
Are you really what we see on the outside?
And hidin' what you really are on the inside
Pretending that you're something you're really not, yeah, yeah
Whole world is a masquerade
Everybody, everybody wears another face (another face)
Whole world is a masquerade
Everybody, everybody wears another face
Just like a masquerade
Just like a masquerade
Can't you see, can't you see what you really are, oh, yeah?
Tell me that you want the world to be a better place, mmm
Yet you fight, makin' war on your fellow man
So why wear this face?
That makes it seem everything's so great, yeah, yeah, Lord, Lord
Whole world is a masquerade (is a masquerade)
Everybody, everybody wears another face (mmm, wears another face)
Whole world is a masquerade
Everybody, everybody wears another face
Oh, another face
Oh, oh, oh, won't you tell me
What can the whole world be hiding?
(I wanna know)
Whole world is a masquerade
What can the whole world be hiding?
(Mmm, wanna know)
Whole world (oh, ooo, Lord, Lord)
What can the whole world be hiding?
(Mmm, wanna know)
Whole world is a masquerade
What can the whole world be hiding?
Oh, won't you tell me
Whole world
What can the whole world be hiding?
I wanna know
Whole world is a masquerade
