4 ContributorsSweater Weather LyricsJe ne suis qu'une femme
Je veux le monde entre mes mains
Je déteste la plage
Mais je reste debout
Avec mes orteils dans le sable
Use the sleeves of my sweater
Let's have an adventure
Head in the clouds but my gravity's centred
Touch my neck and I'll touch yours
You in those little high-waisted shorts, oh
She knows what I think about
And what I think about
One love, two mouths
One love, one house
No shirt, no blouse
Just us, you'll find out
Nothing that I wouldn't wanna tell you about, no
Il fait trop froid
Pour toi ici et maintenant
Alors, laisse-moi tenir
Tes mains dans les trous de mon pull
And if I may just take your breath away
I don't mind if there's not much to say
Sometimes the silence guides our minds
So move to a place so far away, yeah
The goose bumps start to raise
The minute that my left hand meets your face
And then I touch your face
Put my finger on your tongue
'Cause you love to taste yeah
Ces cœurs adorent
Tout le monde les autres battent plus forts
Inside this place is warm
Outside it starts to pour
Coming down
One love, one house
No shirt, no blouse
Just us, you find out
Nothing that I wouldn't wanna tell you about, no, no, no
'Cause it's too cold
For you here
So now let me hold
Both your hands in the holes of my sweater
(Whistle)
'Cause it's too cold
For you here
So now, let me hold
Both your hands in the holes of my sweater
The holes of my sweaterSee Scott Bradlee’s Postmodern Jukebox LiveGet tickets as low as $35You might also likeEmbed
