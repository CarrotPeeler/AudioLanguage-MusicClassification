2 ContributorsTaken For A Ride LyricsNow you think you're something
You think you can fight
You think you can take me down so long with the tie?
We ain't gonna win (?) you won't too?
We won't do nothing because we're through with you
We've been taken for a ride
We know respect, but we've always denied
Taken for a ride...
We ain't got nobody on our side
When we fall we never get to be (?)
We ain't gonna listen, we don't do well
You can take your money, you can go to hell
We won't do nothing and that's to say
And you can take everything and go away
We've been taken for a ride
We know what's right but we've always denied
Taken for a ride...
We ain't got nobody on our side
When we fall we never get to be (?)
Is everybody running around and telling me just what to do
If I'm gonna listen to you, you know what you gotta do
I'm not staying around and no longer (?) you're like a stick

You've been taken for a ride
We know what's right, but we're always denied
We've been taken for a ride
We ain't got nobody on our side
When we fall, we never get to be (?) We never get to be?Embed
