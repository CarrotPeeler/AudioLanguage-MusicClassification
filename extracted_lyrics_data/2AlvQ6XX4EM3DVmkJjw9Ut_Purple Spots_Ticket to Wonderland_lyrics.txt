12 ContributorsRape Room Lyrics
Birds got me hawking game
I'm awful with the falconry
I find myself coughing in a fog of shame and apathy
Calculating grams, my heart palpitating rapidly
Step outside and spit my stomach acid off the balcony
Climb a spiral staircase and pour a glass of agua
An ordinary dog, flea-ridden
Scratching hot spots
Heat spit
Like swallow bottles of hot sauce
Leave kids with each limb hobbled or chopped off
Get raped and pillaged while you babysit the neighbor's children
I let 'em watch to see the awful things that's waiting for them
Uh
Meth brain and a sharp wit
Uh
Chest pains and a heart skipped
The aim of a marksman lays out my target
Nothing left but a red stain on the carpet
Moon turned the tide into miles of carnage
I smile regardless
Cause like Sindai I'm just a pile of garbage
Wild
Heartless, vile, tarnished, eyes wide
Finna bear witness to the silent harvest
I try my hardest not to masturbate to passion plays
Remain a castaway and find a vein to lacerate
I'm a scatterbrain like assassinated Presidents
These faggots need expanded frames of reference
It's evident
Blaze up a stogie straight to my dome piece
The replacement for Kobe and H to the O.V
Most valuable, he plays for my home team
Put your words in my mouth and it tastes like bologna
The fake hype is phony
I cause y'alls wigs to flip
Raw dogs in to walk the goldarn distances
We the rookies with the veteran status
Entering homes just to look inside the medicine cabinets
A couple goofy bastards
Peddling backwards
Looking for a bitch to gag on cheddar and bratwurst
Body painted bullseyes
My lady ate some laxatives
A sado-masochist, played the Tramp - straight up Chaplin shit
Babyface
Came to drain the milk from the titty
To give me anything's like puttin silk on the piggy
They gone and crossed worthless junky with circus monkey
Sparkin up an owl on the prowl for the perfect Skully
Lettin scat and urine curdle in my squirmish tummy
Watchin Eddie Murphy in my PJs, shirt and undies
You ain't gon' get no light without the windowpane
Probably good advice if you've got shit for brains
So most my Xs gave the best to they medicinal 'scripts
(or what?)
Or wound up in a bathtub with slits in they wrists
On some ignorant shit
I'm never zippin my lips
If the whiskey dick limp I'll put my fist in a bitch
I'm pooh bear, you're the honey pot - I go all in
Snowballin', let me cum swap the money shot
Ac' shoutin, "Hurry up and pop with your bombaclot"
So I bust and pull my bloody cock out this youngn's twat
...thought it was something good but it's snot
Prayers under rocks, P-squares run the block
You might also like
These phoney rappers need to wait a minute
Or eat an apple with a razor in it
Cause I ain't gon' stand for no more plagiarism
Old-school, watchin Happy Days on Betavision
Blasted from the vapors and relaxin with a case of Guinness
I like to Puff the Magic Dragon till my brain is lifted
Galaxies away from all reality and feigned affliction
So naturally I made a livin actively creating rhythm
Can't you see how rapidly I raise the limit?
To save the children you don't need to practice pediatrics
Just string your rackets up and swing 'em at the weaker rappers
Rub a genie lamp and wish for cheaper taxes
While I take a trip to Wonderland and sleep with Alice on a Sealy mattress
Illegal habits send my mind to another place
I'm high on a couple things
And I ain't ever gonna change
Everyday, straight madness no joy
All work and no play makes Ac' a dull boy
But I'm the devil
And I'm here to do the devil's work
A disheveled jerk
But still a Maverick like the Jet and Dirk
Never shirk a chance to fire up the purple grass
Yo, I'll burn your ass like I spiked the punch with TurboLax
Drop it like it's hotter than Wasabi in the toaster oven
Outta sight marauder gettin' naughty with the post-production
Goin nuts, I roll a dutch around the mary jane
Purpleberry strain in my lungs so now I'm cool
The rap catapult
Cats get smacked in their mandible
Leave 'em with a f-ractured c-lavicle
Damage - collateral
Travel to planet so fast
Make Santa go, "Damn, that's incredible!"
Palmer Squares - two hippies in a trolley car
Wishing they could cop a golden ticket out the Wonka Bar
How bizarre, better listen
Or you'll find a death threat at your door like Whitney in The Bodyguard
(who can play the Costner part?)
You need to hold a casting call
Dismantle all so-called talent with the raptor claw
I'm dog-shit personified - nasty as hell
Better pass me the L or you can all get lobotomized
Defined as erratic, unlawful and manic
I've been caught on acid, lopping heads off with a hatchet
Straight from the source, ain't no regulations enforced
So I can't stay on my course translated, I'm lost
I reminisce over things that never happened, wait, wait
Let me take that statement and retract it
Don't wanna sound insane like I'm crazier than batshit
But it's the true - when I see a vertebrae I gotta snap it
We fit the cold-lampin' caucasian demographic
That'll cater to the masses till they're laying in a casket
A paper-thin attraction to my old life
Hate to stay attached to it
Cause now my only passion is to hold mics
Ya man's got the flows that fans wanna quote
Term and Ac'- grandiose
Kickin jams for the folks
Cause I propose your invalid approach is a sham or a hoax
Or a practical joke
You can tally the votes - Acumental by a landslide
Got the whole world asking when I'm gonna pass by
But you can't hide from TK and Ac' so just keep them hands high till we fade to black5Embed
