Oh
Oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh

He told me, "I've seen it rise (But)
It always falls
I've seen them come, I seen 'em go"
He said, "All things pass into the night"

And I said, "Oh, no, sir
I must say you're wrong
I must disagree, oh, no, sir
I must say you're wrong
Won't you listen to me?"

He told me, "I've seen it all before
I've been there, I've seen my hopes and dreams a-lying on the ground
I've seen the sky, just begin to fall"
He said, "All things pass into the night"

And I said, "Oh, no, sir
I must say you're wrong
I must disagree, oh, no, sir
I must say you're wrong
Won't you listen to me?"

Goodbye horses, I'm flying, flying, flying over you

Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh10Embed
