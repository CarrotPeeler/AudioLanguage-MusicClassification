20 ContributorsLeash Lyrics
Troubled souls unite!
We got ourselves tonight, c'mon

I am fuel, you are friends
We got the means to make amends
I am lost, I'm no guide
But I'm by your side
I am right by your side, yeah

Young lover, I stand!
It was their idea, I proved to be a man
Take my fucking hand
It was their idea, I proved to be a man

Will myself to find a home
A home within myself
We will find a way
We will find our place

Drop the leash, drop the leash
Get outta my fuckin' face!
Drop the leash, drop the leash
Get outta my fuckin' face!
Drop the leash, drop the leash
Get outta my fuckin'…
Drop the leash, (face) drop the leash
Drop the leash, we are young, drop the leash, we are young
Ah, get outta my fuckin' face!
Drop the leash, drop the leash
Get outta my, my…
(Drop the leash, drop the leash)
You might also like
Delight, delight, delight in our youth!
Ah, no!
Get outta my fuckin' face
(Woah!)2Embed
