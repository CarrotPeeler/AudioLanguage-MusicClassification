16 ContributorsVertigo Lyrics
Do do do do do, do do do do do
Do do do do do, do do do do
Do do do do do, do do do do do (Heartbeat)
Do do do do do, do do do do (Heartbeat)

This might sting a bit, oh, oh
You've got here just in time to see everything fall apart
I'm not upset at all, oh, oh
But it's sad to see that everybody knows

That I've been down in here before
And maybe I could want it more
I know I never tried to stop
I never try

Shut your mouth and hey
So what's one more excuse
Guess I just like the abuse
Dizzied up in my never try
Vertigo
They're calling out for blood
Guess it's just understood
Said we'd always try, long as I
I just don't do
See Marianas Trench LiveGet tickets as low as $25You might also like
Disappointed, oh, oh
And no one thought that this would be me and my everything
Is this pound of flesh enough? Oh, oh
And I'll cut away until you say enough

And I've been down in here before
And maybe I could miss it more
I know I never tried to stop
I never try (Never try)

But oh hey
So what's one more excuse
Guess I just like the abuse
Dizzied up in my never try
Vertigo
They're calling out for blood
Guess it's just understood
Said we'd always try, long as I
I just don't do

Do do do do do, do do do do do
Do do do do do, do do do do
Do do do do do, do do do do do (Heartbeat)
Do do do do do, do do do do (Heartbeat)
Do do do do do, do do do do do (Heartbeat)
Do do do do do, do do do do (Heartbeat)
Do do do do do, do do do do do (Heartbeat)
Do do do do do, do do do do (Heartbeat)
Hey, so what's one more excuse?
Guess I just like the abuse
Dizzied up in my never try
Vertigo
They're calling out for blood
Guess it's just understood
Said we'd always try, long as I

So what's a little vertigo?
(Tell you what you wanna know)
So what's a little vertigo?
(Tell you what you wanna know)
So what's a little vertigo?
(Tell you what you wanna know)
So what's a little vertigo?
(Tell you what you wanna know)
So what's a little vertigo?Embed
