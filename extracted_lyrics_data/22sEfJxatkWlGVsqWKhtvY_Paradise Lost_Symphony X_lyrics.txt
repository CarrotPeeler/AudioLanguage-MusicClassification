10 ContributorsParadise Lost Lyrics
In the cold misty morning
Gleaming rays awake the dawn
Here I stand, a stranger in this land
Does your conscience betray you?
Falling from grace, feel the sun on my face
Does desire still hold true?
Mystified by her beauty, does the hunter pity his prey?
Under starless skies all love must die, and fade away
Take my hand, divine or damned, make a stand
Seize the day
Yours or mine, damned or divine
Draw the line, come what may...

Looking down from ethereal skies
Silent crystalline tears I cry
For all must say their last goodbye to paradise

My yearning is silenced by angelic skin of white
Love conquers all, though heavens fall this fateful night
Yours or mine, damned or divine
Draw the line, serpentine...
Love is a tragedy
All that I have, all that I'll ever need is right here inside
Let the winds of freedom be my guide

Looking down from ethereal skies
Silent crystalline tears I cry
For all must say their last goodbye to paradise
Looking down from ethereal skies
Silent crystalline tears I cry
For all must say their last goodbye to paradise

Say goodbye, goodbye


So I've cheated and I've lied
Been the victim of foolish pride
And I've begged and I've crawled
And I've battled it and bled for it all
So I'll savor the downfall of paradise

Looking down from ethereal skies
Silent crystalline tears I cry
For all must say their last goodbye to paradise

Silent crystalline tears I cry
For all must say their last goodbye to paradise
Looking down from ethereal skies
Silent crystalline tears I cry
For all must say their last goodbye to paradiseEmbed
