1 ContributorIndeed You Do LyricsIndeed You Do
Fit right in here
You mean me no harm
Slipped easily into my shoes
While they were still warm
Brake your fingers to the bone
For all the world to see
You do whatever it takes to
Replace all trace of me
But don't go diggin your own grave
I already made you one
You do whatever it takes
This face still has my name on
And y ou left yourself wide open hopin'
And you'll get your big heart broken too
Indeed You Do

And you left yourself wide open hopin'
And you'll get your big heart broken too
