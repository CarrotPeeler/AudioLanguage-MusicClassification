4 ContributorsFalling for You Lyrics
Said there'd be no going back
Promised myself I'd never be that sad
Maybe that's why you've come along
To show me, it's not always bad

Cause I can feel it, baby
I feel like I'm falling for you
But I'm scared to, let go
I'm scared cause my heart has been hurt so

It's true I've become a skeptic
How many couples really love
Just wish I had a crystal ball
To show me, if it's worth it all

Cause I can feel it, baby
I feel like I'm falling for you
But I'm scared to, let go
I'm scared cause my heart has been hurt so
Yeah, I can feel it, baby
I feel like I'm falling for you
But I'm scared to, let go
I'm scared cause my heart has been hurt so
You might also like
And I've got to be sure
Cause it's been so long
And I cannot take the pain again
If it all goes wrong

Cause I can feel it, baby
I feel like I'm falling for you
But I'm scared to, let go
I'm scared cause my heart has been hurt so
Yeah, I can feel it, baby
I feel like I'm falling for you
But I'm scared to, let go
I'm scared cause my heart has been hurt so

I want you so much
I need you so much (Believe me my love)
I want you so much
I need you so much (Believe me my love)
I want you so much
I need you so much (Believe me my love)
I want you so much
I need you so muchEmbed
