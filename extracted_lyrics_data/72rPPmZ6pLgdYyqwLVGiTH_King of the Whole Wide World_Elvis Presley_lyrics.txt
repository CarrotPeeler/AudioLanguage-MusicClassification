4 ContributorsKing of the Whole Wide World Lyrics
A poor man wants the oyster
A rich man wants the pearl
But the man who can sing when he hasn't got a thing
He's the king of the whole wide world

Come on let's sing (c'mon let's sing)
Sing brother sing (c'mon let's sing)
'Cause the man who can sing when he hasn't got a thing
He's the king of the whole wide world

The rich man wants the princess
The poor man just wants a girl
But the man who can sing when he hasn't got a thing
He's the king of the whole wide world

Come on let's sing (c'mon let's sing)
Sing, brother, sing (c'mon let's sing)
'Cause the man who can sing when he hasn't got a thing
He's the king of the whole wide world

A poor man wants to be a rich man
A rich man wants to be a king
But the man who can sing when he hasn't got a thing
He's the king of the whole wide world

Sing, brother, sing (c'mon let's sing) Uh huh
'Cause the man who can sing when he hasn't got a thing
He's the king of the whole wide world
Come on let's sing (c'mon let's sing)
Sing, brother, sing (c'mon let's sing) Uh huh
'Cause the man who can sing when he hasn't got a thing
He's the king of the whole wide world
Of the whole wide world
Of the whole wide worldEmbed
