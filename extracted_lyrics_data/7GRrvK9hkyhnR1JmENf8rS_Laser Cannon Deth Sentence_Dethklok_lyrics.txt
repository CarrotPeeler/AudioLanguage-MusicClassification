Fire! Fire! Fire! Fire!

Fly hard, into the night
Strapped to a rocket ignited
Last meal sits in your body
Gasoline, turpentine, gunpowder, glycerine
Last rites given to you
Genuflecting with a torch
Punishment outweighs the crime
Explode into the desert sky

Say your goodbyes
That was your life
You'll pay all your penance
Laser cannon deth sentence

D-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-die!
D-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-die!
D-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-die!
D-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-die!
Die!

I'm a rocket, a roman candle
A fucking missile on my way to Hell
I'm a martyr, a saint of sinners
And you will fear me in my death
There's no one that can make me
Repent the things I've done
Evil is my prime objective
I explode and bestow your death
I'm a rocket, a fucking weapon
Of mass destruction, destroy the planet
My lawyer fucked me, I won't get pardoned
The devil waits with fear in his eyes

Seeth blood bathing the sky
Strapped to the mode of destruction
Cellmates explode in front
Barbecued bone fragments, bloodied face, blistered skin
Last moments near you now
As the countdown proceeds
Punishment is your reward
Laugh as they collect your life
Say your goodbyes
That was your life
You'll pay all your penance
Laser cannon deth sentence
Say your goodbyes
That was your life
You'll pay all your penance
Laser cannon deth sentence
