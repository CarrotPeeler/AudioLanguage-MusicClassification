Da capo
Da capo
You're living in a dreamer's dream
Da da capo

One level ahead
I'm calling to you
But touch you I cannot do
To tell you I can't
I'm drawing the line
To greetings to understand

You will find me waiting out in the dark
I'm your everlasting property
You're the one I'm living for and feed
All the time

Da da capo, once again
I'm telling you I am your friend
But you can hear me in your dream
You're living in a dreamer's dream
Da da capo
Gone with the wind I am not
And I visit you too alot
Passing the gridlock
Is a hard thing to do
You might also like
I'm longing to see the offspring of me
To hold it with my bare hands
So talk about me as you used to do
I'm with you from time to time

You will find me waiting out in the dark
I'm your everlasting property
You're the one I'm living for
And feed all the time
With your deeds all the time

Da Da Capo
Once again
I'm telling you I am your friend
But you can't hear me in your dream
You're living in a dreamer's dream
Da Da Capo
Gone with the wind I am not
And I visit you too a lot
Passing the gridlock
Is a hard thing to do

Oh yeah
But you can hear me in your dream
Oh no (you're living in a dreamer's dream)
