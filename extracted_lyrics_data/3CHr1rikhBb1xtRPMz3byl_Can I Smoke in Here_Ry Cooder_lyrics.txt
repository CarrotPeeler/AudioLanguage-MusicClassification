1 ContributorCan I Smoke In Here? Lyrics
Can I smoke in here? Can I sit down?
Am I bothering you? Are you alone?
Is my tie on straight? Do you rate me polite?
Do I need a shave? Do I seem all right?

Well names don't matter, mine's Kash Buk
No it's true
Go ahead laugh, it's good for you
What's that you're drinking? I like your smile you know
Hey mister bartender, please don't be so slow

I think we got a lot in common
That's my brand, wouldn't trade it for the world
We're about the same age on the outside
Inside I'm a thousand years old

Is this your room? You can't do 60 like once I could
Bet you didn't know I was that hot
You didn't know I was that good
You got nothing to fear
Can I smoke in here?
You might also like
Well a steel player friend of mine lived right down the half
These walls are thin nobody, heard him fall
Last of the best without a shadow a doubt
Hi-Lo shag's the last thing he saw before it all faded out

What's that you say? "Life is like a low budget movie"
Slow down there honey, you, you lost me that time
"We all took less, then it closed"
Truest thing you said all night, that's a laugh
You can write it on my epitaph

See you in Heaven or next time, whichever's first
I ain't USDA prime, God knows you seen worse
Just tell Saint Peter at the Golden Gate
I won't be late but let me get it straight
Can I get a beer? Can I smoke in here?

Where's everybody going?
Where's everybody going?
Who let that clave player back in here?Embed
