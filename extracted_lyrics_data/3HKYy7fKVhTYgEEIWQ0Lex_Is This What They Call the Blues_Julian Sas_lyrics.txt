2 ContributorsEverybody Down Lyrics
Imma show you proof
Of the realist dude
Let me tell you now
That he's sicker than you
Tearing off your body parts
Limb from limb
Someone told you that he's nice
That was just a whim
Eating brains like a fucking Zombie
Get your face slashed
Giving your unborn fetus head
Through your pussy gash
If that's not enough
Then take a listen closer
Imma make your ears bleed
Before this song is over
This is Kremorteus
And that is what they call me
I'm the God of Judgment
So get down on your knees
And be prepare to be amazed
At this unholy ruler
But don't stare too closely
Into his gaze
Turning whack rappers into stone
Like Medusa
Probably better off
For being worse than you're use to
What can I say for the meanest guy
Below the earth
In the game of life
It only gets better
Before it gets worse
You might also like
Everybody down with Kremorteus
Put em up
Put em up
Put em up
Everybody down with The Afterlife
Put em up
Put em up

Everybody down with The Underground
Put em up

Put em up
Everybody down with The Str8 Jacket
Put em up
Put em up

Shhhh....
You all wanna know a secret?
I was there
When Julius Caesar
Conquered Rome
I was there
King George The 3rd
Took the throne
I was there
When Christopher Columbus
Sailed the Ocean Blue
I was there
When that rapist looked at you
I was there when I ran him over !SPLAT!
I was there when Urkle turned his head and said
"Did I Do That?"
Now I'm stepping back
And I'm a Renaissance Man
Maybe a Rain Man of sorts
Diggin through trash cans
Doing all I can
Just to get by
Even though I try
It's not enough
Cuz I'm such a lazy guy
But fuck that Yo
Cuz I'm a Juggalo
A real psychopathic motherfucker
And you can bet that that's for certain
If you fuck with the bull too long
You're gonna get the horns
Cuz I'm gonna make you wish
That you were never fucking born
Everybody down with Kremorteus
Put em up
Put em up
Put em up
Everybody down with The Afterlife
Put em up
Put em up
Put em up
Everybody down with The Underground
Put em up
Put em up
Put em up
Everybody down with The Str8 Jacket
Put em up
Put em up
Put em up

Falling angels
Raining down like a thunder storm
I'm sorry
It wasn't my intention
To Misinform
But You're nothing but
What those Jesus freaks say you are
Now put this cross around your neck
And go get hit by a car
In dark alley way
And don't forget to say hey
To your maker
Who never gave a fuck about me anyway
Fuck your church and
Fuck your religion
It wasn't Gods will
That made your decision
It was yours
And only yours
Alone to maker
You're the reason why he's dead on the floor
Make no mistake
You're the one who shot him dead and
You're the one who pulled the trigger
And now it's time for you to pass on
Into something bigger
Come on down to visit
And to keep me company
As I told you once before
You don't wanna fuck we me
Everybody down
Put em up
Everybody down
Put em up
Everybody down
Put em up
Put em up
Put em up x2
Here we go x4

Everybody down with Kremorteus
Put em up
Put em up
Put em up
Everybody down with The Afterlife
Put em up
Put em up
Put em up
Everybody down with The Underground
Put em up
Put em up
Put em up
Everybody down with The Str8 Jacket
Put em up
Put em up
Put em up
Kremorteus
