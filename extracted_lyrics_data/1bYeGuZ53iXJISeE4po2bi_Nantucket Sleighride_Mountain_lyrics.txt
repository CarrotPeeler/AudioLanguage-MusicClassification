1 ContributorNantucket Sleighride (Redux) LyricsGoodbye, little Robin-Marie
Don't try followin' me
Don't cry, little Robin-Marie
'Cause you know I'm comin' home soon
My ship leavin' on a three-year tour
The next time they'll take us from the shore
Wind laced, gather in sail and spray
For the search of the mighty sperm whale
Fly your willow branches
Wrap your body round my soul
Lay down your reeds and drums on my soft sheets
There are years behind us reaching
To the place where hearts go beating
And I know you're last true love I'll ever meet
And I know you're last true love I'll ever meet
And I know you're last true love I'll ever meet
Star buck sharpening his harpoon
The black man playing his tune
He'll be drunk before noonYou might also likeEmbed
