1 ContributorFree From Cares LyricsImprobity
In each word we say
Mendacity
We pretend to pray
Perfidious
The words of Jesus
And anytime
We end up smashed to pieces
Ingratitude
In a world of lies
We are free from cares
We close our eyes
I assume
There is no healer
To heal this world
To make us cleaner
I assume...
Free from cares
Hypocrisy
We show each day
Leads into darkness
We go insane

We are of no account
We jeer the creatures
That we once found
It's tenderness
We are living on
So it's no wonder
That we're all goneEmbed
