3 ContributorsKalifornia Kiddies LyricsThey grew right through the whole damned thing
From the beatnik beginning
Pissed and Pilled and Puffed and Pricked
Down the highway of oblivion
As we dug the Rockin' Insects and
Moved to Mama-Mandrex
They saw right through our acid eyes
And released bonds of shame-sex
Those Kalifornia Kiddies shinning in the sun
Those Kalifornia Kiddies love 'em every one
They felt our hippie happy days
They felt our deepest sorrow
They learned how to embrace the past
And the great Unknown Tomorrow
They'll soon put down this rock
That down the bog soon courses
Daft Decadence and nazi groups
Foul and hostile forces
Those Kalifornia Kiddies shinning in the sun
Those Kalifornia Kiddies love 'em every one
They listened to the sky with you
They heard the bell of peace ring
The message in the flower
The symbol of awakening
They saw you give up meats and sweets
And practice control passion
And all this done stoned, on the run
And through the Veil went crashing
They saw you gain a mantra
From the Master of the Wild Mind
Felt you feel way deep inside
Behind the Veil of Maya
Instinctively they opened up
Their spirit - eyes of Wisdom
Their Fairy Tale will never pale
They dance in Love's bright freedomYou might also likeEmbed
