1 ContributorSalvation Is Here LyricsDying is done
More than you will ever Know
Your prayers, hymns, faith and fairy tales in life all paid off
Fighting is done
Your parents still love each other here
No black eyes, blood or bruises, child you're safe now, welcome home
No we will not find heaven, however hard we try
If we do not leave this place tonight
Salvation is here
Open up your heart without fear
Hiding is done
People here will love you for who you are
We all know that you drink too much to cover it all up
Emptiness is here
Everyone is numb with content
So sit, smile, pose, relax for eternal rest
No we will not find heaven however hard we try
If we do not leave this place tonight
Salvation is here
Open up your heart without fear
Salvation is here
It's everything we never wanted, wasn't it, dear?You might also likeEmbed
