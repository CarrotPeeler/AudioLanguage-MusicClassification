6 ContributorsCongratulations Smack & Katy LyricsGirl, where's your head full of lead?
Can't you see what you're doing to me?
Wipe that disgrace off your face
Look and see what you've done to me
Girl, you look bored
I wish everything about the danger wouldn't make you such a stranger
So what's the deal?
Don't you feel what i'm dealing with?
But it's alright
Girl, come on, I'll show you how to deal with this
But not tonight
Girl, you look bored
I wish everything about the danger wouldn't make you such a stranger
Hold me so close
I can tell you have the best intentions, one of those simple inventions
Never a dull situation, we could just stay on vacation
Never start an argument with you
Something I won't do
Girl, you look bored
I wish everything about the danger wouldn't make you such a stranger
Hold me so close
I can tell you have the best intentions, one of those simple inventions
Now that I have your attentionYou might also likeEmbed
