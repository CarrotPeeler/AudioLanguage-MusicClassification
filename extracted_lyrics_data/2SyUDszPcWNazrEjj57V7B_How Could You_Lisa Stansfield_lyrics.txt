3 ContributorsHow Could You LyricsI get up and look outside
Not a cloud up in the sky
The flowers are just coming into bloom
All the lovers walk together hand in hand
But paradise is nothing without you
I didn't move your coffee cup
The cigarettes that you gave up
All memories of things we used to do
Now I don't even bother with my make-up
I just wanna turn around and wake up with you
To hold on forever
A lifetime you said
So you can see it came as a surprise
After all the promises you made
Just tell me one thing
How could you baby
How could you baby
Tell me right now
Tell me why you changed your mind
How could you baby
How could you baby
Take hold of my world
Turn it upside down then say goodbye
You might also likeI try to cheer myself a while
But can't remember how to smile
If only I could make some sense of this
What I wouldn't say or do to hold you
I'd give everything I have to give you one more kiss
To hold on forever
A lifetime you said
So you can see it came as a surprise
After all the promises you made
Just tell me one thing
How could you baby
How could you baby
Tell me right now
Tell me why you changed your mind
How could you baby
How could you baby
Take hold of my world
Turn it upside down then say goodbyeEmbed
