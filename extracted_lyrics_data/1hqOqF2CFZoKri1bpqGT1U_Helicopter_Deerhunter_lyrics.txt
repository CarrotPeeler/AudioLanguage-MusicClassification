23 ContributorsHelicopter Lyrics
Take my hand and pray with me
My final days in company
The devil now has come for me
And helicopters circling the scene

And I pray for rest
Could you pray for us?
We know he loves you the best
We know he loves you the best

The light's inside my cave
I'm tired of my pains
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh

Oh, these drugs, they play
On me in these terrible ways
They don't pay like they used to pay
I used to make it day to day

No one cares for me
I keep no company
I have minimal needs
And now they are through with me
You might also like
Now they are through with me
Now they are through with me
Now they are through with me
Now they are through with me
Now they are through with me
Now they are through with me
Now they are through with me
Now they are through with me15Embed
