Brush against the back side of my arm
I need the song started over
Your crying made me miss my favorite part
I hear the exclamation point!
Wah!
Her eyes are so there, they're greener (d du du d du du d du du du du)
Her eyes are so there, they're greener (d du du d du du d du du du)
Her eyes are so there, they're greener (d du du d du du d du du du du)
Her eyes are so there, they're greener (d du du d du du d du du du)
Lay back, the song is almost over
I tried to hear you out but I doze off
I need the song started over
Your crying made me miss my favorite part (part of you)
Rachel, Its times like these I wonder!
Her eyes are so there, they're greener (d du du d du du d du du du du)
Her eyes are so there, they're greener (d du du d du du d du du du)
Her eyes are so there, they're greener (d du du d du du d du du du du)
Her eyes are so there, they're greener (d du du d du du d du du du)You might also like2Embed
