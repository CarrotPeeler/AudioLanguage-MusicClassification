1 ContributorLife Sure Does Lyrics
And life . . . Sure does . . . roll at you fast

Crawling, walking, running around
One day the world is a big playground
Kids starting off with a bridge to anyone
Then when we need em we start shutting them down
Mr. Golden throne, Mrs. Golden crown
Would be nobodies if we put them down
Sitting up high miles in the sky
We got mud under nails feet on the ground

There’s . . . a lot . . . of good distractions
Some good, some bad
So get . . . caught up . . . in every moment
It could be the best you’ll ever have

Life sure does roll at you fast
Keeps going forward еven when you’re looking back
Days fеlt like the end of the world
But further up the road, I had to laugh
Time a rock that gathers no moss
Chasing happiness at whatever the costs
Not an employee stuck on the clock
Got to own my position, be the boss
And life . . . Sure does . . . roll at you fast
You might also like
Countless number of right ways
Mistakes all play in replays
But it’s the other possibilities
That get me a little more each day
Instead of firing bullets, killing em dead
Appreciate the world in another’s head
Instead of preaching violence, self-defense
Try to love, accept, be open instead

There’s . . . far too many . . . distractions
To get caught up in only bad
Try . . to make . . . somebody’s moment
It could be the best they ever have

Life sure does roll at you fast
Keeps going forward even when you’re looking back
Days felt like the end of the world
But further up the road, I had to laugh
Time a rock that gathers no moss
Chasing happiness at whatever the costs
Not an employee stuck on the clock
Got to own my position, be the boss
And life . . . Sure does . . . roll at you fast
What if all we get Is only what we’ve got
Would you reconsider your situation
Would it make a difference or not
It’s just a thought, it’s just a thought
It’s just a thought, just a thought
Just a thought

Life sure does roll at you fast
Keeps going forward even when you’re looking back
Days felt like the end of the world
But further up the road, I had to laugh
Time a rock that gathers no moss
Chasing happiness at whatever the costs
Not an employee stuck on the clock
Got to own my position, be the boss

And life . . . Sure does . . . Oh
Life . . . sure does . . . Oh
Life . . . sure does . . . roll at you fast1Embed
