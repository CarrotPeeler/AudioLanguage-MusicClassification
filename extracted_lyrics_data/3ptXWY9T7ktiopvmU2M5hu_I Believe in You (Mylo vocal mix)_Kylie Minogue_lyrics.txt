I believe in you
I believe in you
I believe in you
I believe in you

I don't believe you know me
Although you know my name
I don't believe the faults I have
Are only mine to blame
I don't believe that magic
Is only in the mind
I don't believe I'd love somebody
Just to pass the time

I don't believe that beauty
Will ever bе replaced
I don't beliеve a masterpiece
Could ever match your face
The joker's always smiling
In every hand that's dealt
I don't believe that when you die
Your presence isn't felt

I don't believe you know me
Although you know my name
I don't believe the faults I have
Are only mine to blame
I don't believe that magic
Is only in the mind
I don't believe I'd love somebody
Just to pass the time

I don't believe that beauty
Will ever be replaced
I don't believe a masterpiece
Could ever match your face
The joker's always smiling
In every hand that's dealt
I don't believe that when you die
Your presence isn't felt
I believe in you
I believe in you
I believe in you
I believe in you


I believe in you
I believe in you
I believe in you
I believe in you
I believe in you
I believe in you
I believe in you
I believe in youEmbed
