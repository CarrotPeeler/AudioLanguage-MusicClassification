2 ContributorsBitter Pills LyricsBitter pills & alcohol sorry if I made a scene
Bitter pills & alcohol couldn't bear to kiss his feet
Everybody's going somewhere
My life's going nowhere moving so so slow
Slate grey days in my white walls nothing to talk about
Slate grey days in my white walls couldn't bear to hear about
Everybody going somewhere, my life's going nowhere moving so so slow
I should have stayed safely away, I've shown you up once again
But please understand, please understand
I'm still getting used to the passenger side & restlessness twists in the brain coming on like a train through the signals & straight through the gate so please understand, it comes out all wrong, it isn't me it's the mix I was on
Bitter pills & alcohol sorry if I made a scene
Bitter pills & alcohol couldn't bear to kiss his feet
Everybody's going somewhere
My life's going nowhere moving so so slowYou might also likeEmbed
