4 ContributorsGenie in a Bottle (Flavio vs. Mad Boris Mix) Lyrics
Mmm, my body's sayin', "Let's go"
Oh yeah
Come on, come on, uh, yeah
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (Come on come on, uh yeah)
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh (Come on, come on, uh yeah)
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
(My body's sayin', "Let's go")
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
(But my heart is sayin', "No")
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
(My body's sayin', "Let's go")
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
(But my heart is sayin', "No")

I'm a genie in a bottle, baby
You gotta rub me the right way, honey
I'm a genie in a bottle, baby
Come, come, come on and let me out
I'm a genie in a bottle, baby
You gotta rub me the right way, honey
I'm a genie in a bottle, baby
Come, come, come on and let me out
I'm a genie in a bottle, baby
You gotta rub me the right way, honey
I'm a genie in a bottle, baby
Come, come, come on and let me out
I'm a genie in a bottle, baby
You gotta rub me the right way, honey
I'm a genie in a bottle, baby
Come, come, come on and let me out

I feel like I've been locked up tight
For a century of lonely nights
Waiting for someone to release me
You're lickin' your lips and blowin' kisses my way
But that don't mean I'm gonna give it away
Baby, baby, baby (Baby, baby, baby)

If you wanna be with me
Baby, there's a price to pay
I'm a genie in a bottle
You gotta rub me the right way
If you wanna be with me
I can make your wish come true
You gotta make a big impression
I gotta like what you do
If you wanna be with me
Baby, there's a price to pay
I'm a genie in a bottle
You gotta rub me the right way
If you wanna be with me
I can make your wish come true
You gotta make a big impression
I gotta like what you do
I'm a genie in a bottle, baby
I'm a genie in a bottle, baby
I'm a genie in a bottle, baby
I'm a genie in a bottle, baby
I'm a genie in a bottle, baby
I'm a genie in a bottle, baby
I'm a genie in a bottle, baby
I'm a genie in a bottle, baby
I'm a genie in a bottle, baby
I'm a genie in a bottle, baby
I'm a genie in a bottle, baby
Come, come, come on and let me out
I'm a genie in a bottle, baby
I'm a genie in a bottle, baby
I'm a genie in a bottle, baby
Come, come, come on and let me out

The music's bangin' and the lights down low
Just one more dance and then we're good to go
Waiting for someone who needs me
Hormones racin' at the speed of light
But that don't mean it's gotta be tonight
Baby, baby, baby (Baby, baby, baby)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh (Uh-huh, uh, yeah)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh (Uh, uh yeah)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh (Uh, uh yeah)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
(My body's sayin', "Let's go")
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
(But my heart is sayin', "No")
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
(My body's sayin', "Let's go")
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
(But my heart is sayin' "No")
