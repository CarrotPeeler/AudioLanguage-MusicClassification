2 Contributors404 2020 Lyrics
404-2020 hit my phone
Did it on my own, I don’t want you in my zone
Hit the plug up for the dope, you can watch me blowing smoke
See me pull up in a foreign and I might just hit the road
404-2020 hit my phone
Did it on my own, I don’t want you in my zone
Hit the plug up for the dope, you can watch me blowing smoke
See me pull up in a foreign and I might just hit the road

Ice all on me, yea' it’s cold like a freezer
Always catching plays, yea' just like wide receiver
I came with the heat, I think that I got a fever
Backseat of the whip, yea' you know it’s a Beamer
Gas what we smoke, so you might just need a gas mask
Drip all on me, yea' just like a hydro flask
I see right through you, just like a piece of glass
Do this little task, yea' that’s all I ask
Seeing x-ray vision, feels like something missing
404 2020, yea' we finna kick it
All these stars in the sky and it got me wishing
​emptycut, feel like an empty incision
You might also like
404-2020 hit my phone
Did it on my own, I don’t want you in my zone
Hit the plug up for the dope, you can watch me blowing smoke
See me pull up in a foreign and I might just hit the road
404-2020 hit my phone
Did it on my own, I don’t want you in my zone
Hit the plug up for the dope, you can watch me blowing smoke
See me pull up in a foreign and I might just hit the road

Call me, beep me, you know how to reach me
Want and need me, baby just don’t leave me
I am dreaming, see you when I’m sleeping
Lie, mistreat me, girl just don’t delete me
Hit me up, dial tone, beggin’ please leave me alone
Yea Error 404 takin flights across the globe
Bitch you already know we 404 to the bone
Out here makin’ waves pussy boy you just a clone
Pop a pill, blowin’ smoke, man I hope I overdose
Take a blunt to the dome man it got me movin’ slow
James Bond, double O, see me crackin’ all these codes
Baby girl you can never have the password to my phone

Why you wanna be me?
I don’t even like me
Blood on my white tee
Blood on my Nikes
Poppin’ seals, poppin’ pills
Cannot feel my face, it’s not real
Blunt to the face I can’t chill
She hit me up askin’ how I feel
Said she wanna fuck fuck
Girl you smell like a dump truck
Girl you got me fucked up
Girl you got your luck upEmbed
