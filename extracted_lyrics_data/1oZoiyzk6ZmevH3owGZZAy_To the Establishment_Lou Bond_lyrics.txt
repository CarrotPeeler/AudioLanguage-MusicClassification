3 ContributorsTo The Establishment LyricsI might give out
But I'll never give in
We might as well
Be friends, yes we have
You say that on Sunday
I should wear myself a suit and tie
But I went to my grandmama's funeral and I was
Knickerbocker down
I know a couple of orphan kids
That I would just love to have for my very own
But you say to me that I got to get married
Before I can give those children a happy home
When we realize
That realness is real
It's only what we feel
Realness is something that comes from the earth
On its own free will
A woman is a woman
But a man is a whole lot of man
I might give out
But I'll never give in
We might as well
Be friends, yes we have
You keep figuring out ways
To get my every hard earned cent
You even got me going to the grocery store
Buying cherry flavored chapstick
And I want you to know
That I think it's all a great big
One-sided event
If I had my way
I'd put you all in the electric chairYou might also likeEmbed
