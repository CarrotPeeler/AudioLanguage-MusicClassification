11 ContributorsShotgun Suge vs. T-Top Lyrics
I said I still ain't figured out what's going on in my city yet
I mean it seem like to white cops the black skin be the biggest threat
It's like they'll let you shoot up a church, but kill you for some cigarettes
You put your hands up and they'll shoot you while you surrenderin'
I pray daily I just ain't bit all that religion shit
All I know is one day you die and that's the end of it
But that's the problem we don't take time out for the innocent
So I'ma make a moment of silence for they remembrance
Okay let's kick the shit, I'm looking for Shotgun Suge with a pistol grip
Shotgun, Suge won't know it till a nigga hit
We both fat, black and rappers but the difference is I'm with the shit
He tap my pockets and I'ma split his shit
I know y'all like Top was just talking good but who gives a shit
I'll pop his bitch ass for nothing I'm a hypocrite
That .45 divide him by 40 teach him arithmetics
Then freeze his insides cause my hogs need a Christmas gift
Let's switch the shit, cause we know that you sweet we peep ya flavor Suge
You either don't care about Crips or you a hater Suge
Shotgun vs Cal' remember? So I don't have to replay it, good
Just know that Surf got locked for tryin' to save the hood
Now if y'all paid close attention all them Grapes was good
Ars' made it back to Jersey blowing haze with Suge
He like "We can get cuz out you know my paper good"
Then Suge looked back and said, "Shieeet that nigga neighborhood."
We thought you was putting in work, you's a joke nigga
Touch mines you begging for bucks like a broke nigga
If I start a war I go end it, my co (code) rilla (realer)
I will never send my niggas alone to those niggas
I said you a hoe nigga I hold triggers
Where your daughter hang
The bitch playing hopscotch cool, well I ain't for them games
I can take her down to the corner and get a porno made
Or shoot her, either way i'm letting the .40 bang
And I ain't even turn up yet this is just the warning phase
If I send two pop (2Pac) Suge it's getting more than grazed
I'll have his whole family cryin' and a mourning staged
Cause I put money on Shotgun like a bought a gauge
Or I could catch his bitch in the club wait till she kinda tipsy
Put a lil coke in her drink, then give her time to sip it
She pass out I take the bitch home and start wyling in it
Leave a pudding cup and a note that say, "Cosby did it"
My mind is different I ain't fucking with these bitch niggas
And he like to talk to the cops, so you a snitch nigga?
With a name like Jimmy News (Noose)...I'm 'bout to lynch niggas
Broad daylight I don't care if you got ya kids with ya
How you gon bully a bully? Cause you big nigga?
Well I got something specially made for the big niggas
Call my gun Mr. Cee that bitch BIG nigga
Pull up on the side of his V *skiiirt* then Big niggas
If he ain't got Faith on his side he can't live nigga
I coulda left Charlie in Baltimore how I wig nigga
I followed that star to the North cause he the Big Dipper
Pop her before I see J like his big sister
Let's get it started a knife user, a semi sparker
And I'm strapped with Dyn-o-mite like Jimmy Walker
Greg will put Suge on his ass I'm with the barber
He'll press a dent (president) right in his mouth like Jimmy Carter
Let's get it started, boy I'm dumping at your men
You're a beast on stage but you're a punk after the event
Hitman said, "Fuck you, you gets nothing after this."
Just tell him a bear killed him
(A hunting accident!)
You might also like
I said let me get this off my chest you cake soft
Smack, Thank Me sooner or Later he Drake soft
Every bar he sound like a bitch' Drake song
Man I'll smack ya lights out if you blink wrong
Spaz something I ain't did in a while
I'm Snoop he JD how I give him a BOW
I got the D but I'll give him the Cal'
Head shot, make him sit Indian style
He talk about them straps that he gotta go get
I got it on me now, bang the hammer at his feet make him do the James Brown
He wanna be a Godfather this .40 knock a hole out him
Thought he was Super Bad, this pump Get On Up and knock the soul out him
Smack he needs a doctor cause I done hit him something proper
Mike Epps Friday After Next I'm in his yard with the chopper
He wanna battle rap, cause his tape failed
I wrote all I'ma kill you shit like hate mail
Body work, cake shells he gon be hard to find, like a cosign to make bail
You trap right? I got a bigger block
If I want his block I'll cinder block
Bandanna on the barrel shit built like a Swiffer mop
I'll spin his block with a different stock
That's his brother though, but the shit got a different pop
Let me catch you sipping 40's after dark
With his man I see sipping from the start
Come through ratchets swinging get him pushed in the park
Jai don't hold me back he holding back
He failed the school of hard knocks he had to hold em back
He ain't no boss on the block he's a stunt dummy
Like you know roll his blunt for me
Big Brody don't pay for nothing, I'll take this nigga lunch money
That's what it's all about it's a money game
Straps I'm all in the subway with it like the Money Train
I feel like AI when I'm on for the molly
He cross me I cross him but I'm catching a homi
Step back shoot, watch him drop then step over the body
I can mask up, split his top, show up to the funeral with a mop
Half the clip magic trick how I split his box
Crazy part about it he think we're friends though
When only Family Matters; The Winslows
That's why you only gonna get two .30 rounds Extendos
Get him the fuck outta here
Jersey the fuck here
I said yo, it's only me and you Jimmy, whatchu wanna do now?
We brought the Shotgun for Suge, I ain't fuckin' around
Duck tape, and a potato on the front of the pound
It's only good for one shot, but it muffle the sound
The gauge full, I had a hard time stuffin' 'em down
Big nose, Harley Quinn, I'm in love wit' a clown
He got performance, his bars just a bum to the crowd
With the shotgun that I got, make a wonderful sound
Chicka BOOM, a knee shot boy I buckle him down
Chicka BOOM, a stomach shot put his lunch on the ground
Chicka BOOM, a head shot right in front of the crowd
I make it feel like Frank Lucas back runnin' around
We runnin' this now, I'm ridin' wit' all of the new cats
We like the '03 draft, Smack how did you do that?
First event we sold out, made all of 'em lose stats
Now they bitches wit' bars, Orange Is The New Black
Listen, you gang bang I bang bang, bitch who go harder?
I'll smack the shit out ya bitch wit' a boat starter
You catch me cookin' in the trap wit' my coke partners
Direct line to the plug that's a phone charger
Nigga, I was in my aunt crib, she had a nose problem
She fell asleep in her coat watchin' soap operas
Nigga I was baggin' on my lap for the do' knockers
And had the white on my jeans like I stone washed 'em
My whole squad is raw, bitch you are not liver
I'll Surf to ya crib wit' a Cal', it ain't a Glock nine
It's skinny but the nose spread, that bitch Roc size
The Clip push down by Hollows, see this my top five
I pop guys, lettin' 'em know who really here
I chop Suge up in pieces, I'm talkin' little squares
His grandma walked in seen the blood and got really scared
So I gave the bitch some sugar like I really cared
Listen, or I can put your baby to sleep in a bathtub, body christened
If I lay her down, she won't get back up
I choke her first, slide the bitch under the cover
Rub her forehead and tell her have fun wit' her mother
Y'all niggas can catch me ridin' through New York
I'm finna blow New Jersey up
But not the whole state, just 
I put ratchets to fruit baskets leave 'em burgundy Grapes
I ain't playin', I'm outside, dolo, cause I heard it was safe
Even clappin' nosy neighbors leavin' burgundy drapes
Nigga I had that T-Rex .537, and that's my main heater
I'm only tryin' to hear him spit, it's like a Wayne feature
I cut his head off, he ain't duckin' a blade neither
Dangle it in front of the crowd and call it a brain teaser
Nigga, where ya bitch cause shorty gettin' the same treatment
She was runnin' her mouth and now that thang bleedin'
I spray a bottle of bleach just for the stain cleanin'
Burn the bottom of her neck to stop the vein leakage
Nigga, we here for the same reasons
We just ain't handle it the same
I went broke, I bagged up, handlin' them thangs
Givin' hope to my mans like he could beat cancer in the brain
You was here on Smack dancin' wit' the thang
Nigga you from Newark? I'm from the south boy, our chances weren't the same
All you did was cross the bridge and had a camera in ya face
I was jookin', state to state wit' a hammer in my waist
Only Suge (sugar) I battled could get me landed in case
Concrete nigga
Ayo, let's get one thing straight, Rell
Everything about you is fake, Rell
I see it all in ya face, Rell
You think you fuckin' wit' me, ain't enough coke on ya plate, Rell
I got nicks for sale, nigga I got bricks for sale
I heard he Grindin', I'm on his block, 2 clips (Clipse) for Rell (Pharrell)
I supervise the trap, day and night, Sin City
Jump off the porch, check him, his chin skinny
He thought he was hard, he soft candy
I get his peanut chewed, for ten pennies
I play the streets hard, duckin' the one time
Nine piece, no fries, I dump mine
He gon' catch it like Biscuit, for crossin' that gun line
He always wanna talk about his struggle, how he flipped his last 100 pack
Tell a different story, how I keep a pistol on me
You keep talkin' 'bout ya mother, I'll have her handle business for me
You know, run the corner store, hella coke low inventory
But black, on the road wit' the white, you don't get the glory
Aim at his beard, the steel can' a different .40
Listen shorty, I can teach you somethin'
That drug talk, you don't know whatchu talkin' 'bout like you speak for nothin'
You bag dope, you on the street for nothin'
Fuck these bars, make sure it's the steel if you reach for somethin'
And stop talkin' 'bout your flips, get money in silence
Your street shit fake, like Money & Violence
You'se a fraud nigga, say that
The streets? We don't know you like the bitch that scream Maybach
I doo rag a nigga, wave cap, his chin I blade that
Now his face got a slave back
I'm mad, cause you really think you cool
Now Smack gotta take you dyin'
I ain't drunk, when I drop his dog out a window; Frankie Lymon
Your mother, FaceTime the coke like a Skype box
Hittin' eight balls at the night spot
100 grams make the price drop
Bakin' soda, be more (Bmore) on it, that's light Roc(k)
Watch the pressure when the pipe pop
Top this is where ya life stop
This shotty? A nice thot
This big bitch knock across the field like the 
I'll bat him down and he'll get beat crazy
Six shells in the .380, I know he dead, his feet lazy
Tried to play Hardball and got G-Baby'd
I heard he stealin' like John John
He a Family Guy; Don Don
Big shit, like where they find mine
They ain't know he was dead til you seen a "RIP T-Top" on his timeline
Jersey

Nigga complain cause every battle y'all get the same from me
Y'all get bars, delivery, action...a lot of pain from me
See them first two rounds, I just wanted to prove he couldn't hang wit' me
But now, I'ma give y'all the top y'all came to see
My bitch blowin' up my line cause I don't stay home
She either want Bizzy or bro and then I change phones
I see the blue and whites, the D's, even the plain clothes
Dope on me, yeah I'm dirty, but these my play clothes
Nigga I don't switch it up for shit, I keep the same toast
Cause once I catch a body wit' mines, that nigga stay close
He packed full of hollow heads, that mean his brain gone
Mouth shot, you and my buddy sharin' the same dome
I keep pullin' back to back, nigga I chain smoke
Then wrap his head up since he Muslim he know how thangs go
I blindfold him out in the desert, y'all better pray for him
Cause soon as I cut on the camera I let his brains go
Now, by the sound of ya name, you got some Grape folks
You prolly skipped out on the Shahada that they paid fo'
You saw some purple flags on ya block, then became loc
I get it, you a fruit and a Grape cause it's the perfect shape for him
But me? Nigga I ain't have no gang, I made my name known
Hooked up wit' nigga like me that like to slang dope
Park life, we all struggled and had to shave coke
I'm just satisfied that my niggas ain't wearin' state clothes
I said they turned me into a killer for real, on some fun shit
I like to play laser tag but wit' a gun clip
I talk to him first, on some butter and gun shit
Then knock his head off all over some dumb shit
Y'all know shotgun killed Ricky, well can you run bitch?
Miramax, Shotgun gotta battle a pump grip
I dump quick, Smack ya better talk to boy
I leave Suge in all red like the '95 Source Awards
I say yo, and why the fuck are we callin' you "Suge"?
Cause you the sweetest homie?
Well J goin' out like 'Pac, I got these heaters on me
If I Snoop on Ars', I'm doin' more than just schemin' on him
And Red? Nate Dogg, he gon' die soon as he see the .40
Nigga, y'all niggas like a football team when the block boomin'
Eleven niggas just to make one play? Well that's stupid
Cops came, he had the option to run, he can't do it
So the nigga got stuck wit' the lines, he ain't movin'
And mines like basketball my stat zoomin'
I started at the top of the key wit' packs movin'
I tried to slide my man the rock, he a bad shooter
Three months off the block, he turned to a glass user
But it's my fault, see I introduced him to crack movin'
Showed him how to turn 4 into 8, a math tutor
I gave him three months and homie was back lootin'
Now he tryin' to hit a 7-11, he crack shootin'
Nigga it's park life, all my niggas made it out the gutter, dark nights
I had to put the thang under the cover, hard times I wouldn't put the razor on the butter
Which got me on a first name basis with my mother
I had old money, I didn't know what to do wit' the cake
Shit I was countin' hundreds til they turned blue in the face
Refusin' the banks, that had nothin' to do wit' the chase
But why do that when I could just be usin' my safe
Concrete nigga

Smack threw a crook at him
Cold killer throw the book at him
Closed casket so his mama can't look at him
Potato, keep the chrome silent, Newark nigga, condone violence
I'm on his porch, wit' two .30s, they foam posits
I'm the bully, I'm walkin' 'round Debo of the street
Nine millys, MAC-10s all in the Jeep
Oh y'all hang in the park? Me and J pop up like Jody and Pea
Y'all  yourselves tryin' to jump somebody
I step up like, "Who wanna fight?"
"Aye homie you tried to steal my liquor?"
"Aye cuz you tried to steal my bike?"
Talkin' 'bout bear witness
Bear witness to what?
My first drive-by was on a fuckin' scooter
He talkin' 'bout huntin' accident...man think of somethin' cooler
Cause ain't no bears 'round here, you huntin' a fuckin' shooter
They said you hungry, we got the same mind
But this Shotgun will put a hole in you and give everybody leg shots at the same time
I knew your mother, I know the truth about her
How that heron almost crucified her
Put cuts in her arm, like they brutalized her
Gave her dope for her apartment, that's how you utilize her
Put needles in her body, but I ain't a voodoo doctor
Grams of the smack, she go head first like a scuba diver
She call me for the bricks, I pull up on her like an Uber driver
And tell her what to do wit' the work like a supervisor
Where the fuck Hitman Holla at?!
Ya mother look like Fran on the corner yellin'
You'se a crack baby, all you talk about is what the corner sellin'
You'se a motherfuckin' liar, what's up wit' all the story tellin'?
Yo, I kill him on cam' he think he capo
He want beef, then them shells come like a taco
His taco, then hide him underground like El Chapo
The streets, I've been there
Four shots tucked in the ride, I've been there
When it's goin' through your mind, you gon' beg 'em let 'em slide
I've been there, when niggas tell us "Either you shoot or you drive"
I've been there, before you kill 'em, look him dead in his eyes
I've been there...

Last battle Jaz The Rapper tried to talk about my man tits
She used to be my baby til my man hit
Caught her Surf'in through Jersey on fan shit
NuNu Nellz was wit' her, I guess she was on his man dick
Jersey, where the fuck is Hitman Holla at man?3Embed
