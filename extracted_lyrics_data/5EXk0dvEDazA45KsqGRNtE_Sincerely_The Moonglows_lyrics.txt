Sincerely, oh yes, sincerely
'Cause I love you so dearly
Please say you'll be mine

Sincerely, oh you know how I love you
I'll do anything for you
Please say you'll be mine

Oh Lord, won't you tell me why
I love that girlie so?
She doesn't want me
Though I'll never, never, never, never let her go

Sincerely, oh you know how I love you
I'll do anything for you
Please say you'll be mine

Oh Lord, won't you tell me why
I love that girlie so?
She doesn't want me
Though I'll never, never, never, never let her go

Sincerely, oh you know how I love you
I'll do anything for you
Please say you'll be mine

Oh, say you'll be mineEmbed
