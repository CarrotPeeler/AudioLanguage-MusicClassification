1 ContributorElected LyricsThe time is right now for me to take over
No more lies no more dirty alibi's
I'm not the hypocrite like the others are
Look at me your future star
Vote for me an I'll be elected
Vote for me the right man and respected
We can all be one but we are not the same
You are all a brick in my game
You're future destiny in my hands
Look at me your future star
Vote for me an I'll be elected
Vote for me the right man and respectedYou might also likeEmbed
