I always dreamed the boy I loved would come along
And he'd be tall and handsome, rich and strong
Now that boy I love has come to me
But he sure ain't the way I thought he'd be

Sha-la-la-la-la, hey, hey, yeah
Sha-la-la-la-la, hey, hey, yeah
Sha-la-la-la-la, hey, hey, yeah
He's sure the boy I love

He doesn't look like a movie star
He doesn't drive a Cadillac car
He sure ain't the boy I've been dreamin' of
But he's sure the boy I love

(Let me tell ya now)
He'd never be a big businessman
He always buys on the installment plan
He sure ain't the boy I've been dreamin' of
But he's sure the boy I love

When he holds me tight
Everything's right, crazy as it seems
I'm his, whatever he is
And I forget all of my dreams
You might also like
Everybody knows
He doesn't hang diamonds 'round my neck, oh, oh
And all he's got's an unemployment check
He sure ain't the boy I've been dreamin' of
But he's sure the boy I love


When he holds me tight
Everything's right, crazy as it seems
I'm his, whatever he is
And I forget all of my dreams, oh-oh-oh

He doesn't hang diamonds 'round my neck
And all he's got's an unemployment check
He sure ain't the boy I've been dreamin' of
But he's sure the boy I love

Whoa-ho-ho, yeah
(He's sure the boy I love)
Whoa-ho-ho, yeah
(He's sure the boy I love)
Ho-ho, woah
(He's sure the boy I love)
Ho-ho, woah
(He's sure the boy I love)
(He's sure the boy I love)
Whoa-ho–Embed
