2 ContributorsMasquerade Lyrics
She's surreal
She's dangerous and no one else can match those eyes
She's concealed
So mysterious, that nobody can catch her lies

Drop this game of fame
No one can win
I believe this can be serious if I can get under her skin

We're both in this masquerade
What can I do to see you
The girl behind the mask
Our love was just a masquerade
I wanna get to know you
The girl behind the mask
I want a chance to feel you
The girl behind the mask

A masquerade
A masquerade
A masquerade
A masquerade
You might also like
Every time we sit around and talk
I try to turn her inside out
I get closer but still miles away
From getting what she's all about

Stop this masquerade
No one can win
I believe this can be serious
If I can get under your skin
No

We're both in this masquerade
What can I do to see you
The girl behind the mask
Our love was just a masquerade
I wanna get to know you
The girl behind the mask
I want a chance to feel you
The girl behind the mask

A masquerade
A masquerade
A masquerade
A masquerade
Our love was just a masquerade
I wanna get to know you
The girl behind the mask
I want a chance to feel you
The girl behind the mask

A masquerade
A masquerade
A masquerade
A masquerade

I'm confused and I just don't know what to be for you
I'm so vulnerable I need you to confess your love for me

A masquerade, a masquerade
A masquerade, a masquerade
A masquerade, a masquerade
A masquerade, a masquerade

We're both in this masquerade
What can I do to see you
The girl behind the mask
Our love was just a masquerade
I wanna get to know you
The girl behind the mask
I want a chance to feel you
The girl behind the mask
(A masquerade)
A masquerade
A masquerade
(A masquerade)
A masquerade
A masquerade

Our love was just a masquerade
I wanna get to know you
The girl behind the mask
I want a chance to feel you
The girl behind the maskEmbed
