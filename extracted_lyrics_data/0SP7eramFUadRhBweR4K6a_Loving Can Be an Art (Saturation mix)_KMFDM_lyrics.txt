3 ContributorsLoving Can Be An Art (Saturation Mix) LyricsBlock the way
It is bubbling
It is proud to burn
And it burns nice
It feels good
Oh yo yo
Check this out
Dropping science
And it goes a little bit something like this
Check this out
Humping it up
Jacking it down
Loving can be an art
Lie on your back
Lie on your back
Loving can be an art
I can make it go snap snap snap
Loving can be an art
I can make you go crack crack crack
Loving can be an art
I can eat that bag of tricks like this
Gonna feel healthy
Gonna feel fine
That little conillon's mine, mine, mine
Don't worry 'bout me, there's plenty of time
There's plenty of time for everything
Gonna feel healthy
Gonna feel fine
That little conillon's mine, mine, mine
You might also like
Murder
Beat my meat
Gimme that treat
Loving can be an art
I'll smoke a little while
I really like your style
Loving can be an art
I can make you go, "Ow Ow!"
Make you go, "Ow! Ow!"
Loving can be an art
I can make you go, "Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!"
Loving can be an art
Yo, yo
Lovin', lovin', lovin', lovin'
Loving can be an art
Gonna feel healthy
Gonna feel fine
That little conillon's mine, mine, mine
Don't worry 'bout me, there's plenty of time
There's plenty of time for everything
Gonna feel healthy
Gonna feel fine
That little conillon's mine, mine, mine
Loving can be an art
Don't worry 'bout me, there's plenty of time
Loving can be an art
There's plenty of time for everything
