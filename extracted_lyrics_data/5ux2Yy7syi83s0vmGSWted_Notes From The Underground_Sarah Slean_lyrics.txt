2 ContributorsNotes From The Underground LyricsNotes from the underground
Where the mice must write our lives down
In the night, I hear you calling out to say
It's all right, love, you're in good hands
Tears on a borrowed bed
'Tween walls that are painted somebody else's red
If you hear me cry out, calling out to say
It's all right love, you're in good hands
Still out on the roof
Howling at the moon
Exiles
Another exile in the kingdom
Still out on the roof
All I need is you
Exiles
Oh, we are exiles
We two
Love with the love they hide
Dream with the dream the cast aside
Oh the truth will form and fall apart again
It's all right love, you're in good hands
Still out on the roof
Howling at the moon
Exiles
Another exile in the kingdom
Still out on the roof
All I need is you
Exiles
Oh, we are exiles
We two

They kick our verses aside
But we know the road is wide, that's why
Still out on the roof
Howling on the moon
Exiles
Another exile in the kingdom
Still out on the roof
I'm a dreamer too
Exiles
We are exiles
We twoEmbed
