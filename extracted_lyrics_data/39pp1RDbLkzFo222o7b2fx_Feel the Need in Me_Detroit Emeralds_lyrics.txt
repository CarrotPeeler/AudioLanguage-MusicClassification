3 ContributorsFeel the Need in Me LyricsSee how I'm walkin', see how I'm talkin'
Notice everything in me
Feel the need, oh, feel, feel the need in me
I need you by my side to be my guide
Can't you see my arms are open wide, mm-mm
Feel the need, oh, feel, feel the need in me
(I need your love)
Ev'ry day I need it (Love), ev'ry day I want it (Love)
Without your sweet, sweet love I'd rather die
(I need your love)
I need it constantly (Love), your love takes care of me (Love)
Your love is better to me than apple pie, ooh
Just put your hand in mine, love me all the time
The proof you will plainly see, mm
Feel the need, oh, feel, feel the need in me
Ah
I need you on the case to keep my heart in place
You make me what I need to be, ooh
Feel the need, oh feel, feel the need in me
Oh, your love is tough, now can't get enough
Girl, your love is so important to me
Feel the need, hey, feel it, feel the need in me
