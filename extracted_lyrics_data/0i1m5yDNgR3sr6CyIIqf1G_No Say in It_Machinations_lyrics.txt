2 ContributorsNo Say In It Lyrics
Craving for affection again
It's too soon to feel what the body requires
Keepin it under control
You're a saint (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
It's lookin' good ahead of time
Playing ladies
She's keeping it out in the open
She's no angel
But she can make her own way

You've got no say in it
She's known danger
She can make her own way
You've got no say in it
She's pure instinct
She should make her own way

(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Starvin' for some more confusion
You seem to know what the body requires
No more thinking out in the open
Under control
So you can make your own way
You might also like
You've got no say in it
She's known danger
She can make her own way
You've got no say in it
She's pure instinct
She should make her own way

You've got no say in it
She's known danger
She can make her own way
You've got no say in it
She's pure instinct
She should make her own way home

(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Seeing that reaction's growing
Your senses just leave, your body's on fire
Now she's pretending it's under control
You're no saint
When instinct makes its own way

You've got no say in it
She's known danger
She can make her own way
You've got no say in it
She's pure instinct
She should make her own way
You've got no say in it
She's known danger
She can make her own way
You've got no say in it
She's pure instinct
She should make her own way

You've got no say in it
She's known danger
She can make her own way
You've got no say in it
She's pure instinct
She should make her own wayEmbed
