I'm in no hurry I can take my time, oh my
I'm going red and my tongue's getting tied
I'm off my head and my mouth's getting dry
Let's spend the night together
Now I need you more than ever
Let's spend the night together now
I feel so strong that I can't disguise, oh my
But I just can't apologize, oh my
Don't hang me up and let me down
We could have fun just fooling around
Let's spend the night together
Now I need you more than ever
Let's spend the night together now
There's no disguising, baby
I can't decide, baby
I need you more than ever
Let's spend the night together
Let's spend the night together now
It doesn't happen to me every day, oh my
No excuses for it anyway, oh my
I'll satisfy your every need
And now I know you will satisfy me

Now I need you more than ever
Let's spend the night together
Now I need you more than ever
Let's spend the night together
Now I need you more than ever
Let's spend the night together
Now I need you more than ever
Let's spend the night together
Now I need you more than ever
Let's spend the night together
Now I need you more than everEmbed
