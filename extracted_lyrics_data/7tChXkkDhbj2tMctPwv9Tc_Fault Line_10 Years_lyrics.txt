10 ContributorsFault Line Lyrics
I felt you cut free
Turning cold shoulders to me
Growing blame lines
Communicating lies
Nothing more to trust
Fallacies of love

Killing all that holds you

Bring me back to this
What you said, useless
Leave me
I'll shed my skin
These scars will mend

Don't worry about me
The heart's supposed to bleed
Purity is drained
Help each other die
I see it, I see it in your eyes

Killing all that holds you

Bring me back to this
What you said, useless
Leave me
I'll shed my skin
These scars will mend

Eyes twitch and lies itch of nervous
Eyes twitch and lies itch of nervous ending
Innocence is ugly
In the one who is guilty

Bring me back to this
What you said, useless
Leave me
I'll shed my skin
These scars will mendEmbed
