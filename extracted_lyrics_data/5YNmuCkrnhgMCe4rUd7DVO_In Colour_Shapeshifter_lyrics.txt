1 ContributorIn Colour LyricsIf you could rule it all, what would you do?
Would you be so bold and make it new?
Would you take all the grey and paint it blue?
Let all the colour ignite tonight
If you could take the war and all its pain
Grab all the negative, and do the same
Soak them all up and then rinse them away
Let all the colours ignite tonight
Let all the colours ignite tonight, yeah
Let all the colours ignite tonight, tonight
Let all the colours ignite tonight, yeah
Cause what we had when days are grey
You went and chase the miles away
New light to the rise
Let all the colour ignite tonight
All that is said and done
Nothing to lose but trying to run
Light up to see the fire
If you could take the slate and wipe it clean
Set all the parts adrift upon the sea
With the incoming tide we breath again
Let all the colour ignite tonight
You might also likeSee crystal walls we counting back to the start
I'm burning energy my beating heart
Into the sky we start to live again
Let all the colour ignite tonight
Let all the colours ignite tonight, yeah
Let all the colours ignite tonight, tonight
Let all the colours ignite tonight, yeah
Cause what we had when days are grey
You went and chase the miles away
New light to the rise
Let all the colour ignite tonight
All that is said and done
Nothing to lose but trying to run
Light up to see the fire
Let all the colour ignite tonightEmbed
