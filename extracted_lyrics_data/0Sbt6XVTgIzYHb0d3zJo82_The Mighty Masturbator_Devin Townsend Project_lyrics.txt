8 ContributorsThe Mighty Masturbator LyricsOhh, all you know, go slow
Twenty-five years at the factory child
All for dying
Wife and children now
But you know? I've been working on a plan to save us all!
You know me, and I'm just staying late tonight my dear
Sleep well
I'm home!
So you've come!
You know, you know
I'm alright to fly!
Only we both know, we never once were right!
Oh my lord
Say goodnight to the boy, and then we EXPLODE with never one regret!
Oh my god, it's happening once again!
Wasting my life with the worn designs
But it's time to go!
We're wasting away as people now
And the worlds seen it all before
Sew the wire!
Now, comes the time
Where the night speaks to me, the words speak through me, now!
(Sounds are forming round me, sounds are forming round!)
Do you know? How many more days and nights of this I must handle??
Keep control, control!
No one can see, they mustn't see!
But they will come to recognize my name!
'Cause I've finally, I've finally found a way to save the world!

Save the world, you fool, you child!
You can't ever save the world, you fool, you child!
You can't ever, ever celebrate!
You better change your mind!
Save the world, you fool, you child!
You can't ever, ever save the world, you fool, you child
You can't ever, ever set aflame!
You better change!
(Save the spectacular world of tomorrow!!!)
Save the world, you fool, you child!
You can't ever, ever save the world, you fool, you child
You can't ever, ever celebrate!
You better change!
Feelings, they're exaggerated!
But on another level I'm just
Groovy!
Oh yeah, smoooooooth
Lookin' fine!
You better save your mind!
Maybe we could go to space?
Maybe we'll have more luck connecting
Maybe the electromagnetic impulses will be on our side?
Yes!
Love has conducted us unto one death!
And my conductor, with his spans extended, took of the earth
And with his fists well filled, he threw it into those rapacious gullets!
The time of reckoning is beyond us!
The time is now!
We come to you: to extend ourselves for consideration into the intergalactic community!
We bring to you: the process of human development!
Brothers and sisters are you with me?!
Now!
Give it up, your world!
Give it up, your world!
Give it up, your world!
Give it up, your world!
I've seen all I have seen
We have always been there!
I've seen all I have seen
We have always been there!
We praise God!
He lives inside of our hearts!
We pray to God, he lives inside of our minds!
We praise God!
He lives inside of our hearts!
We pray to God!
So you come around, and we know what you came for
And we are one of mind, and we are home
We praise ourselves!
We live inside of our minds!
We praise ourselves!
We live inside of our minds!
I've seen all I have seen
We have always been there!
I've seen all I have seen!
Now we come alive! And you've been over-time
If we are one of mind, then we are God!
We praise Satan!
He lives inside of our hearts!
We praise Satan!
He lives inside of our hearts!
We praise ourselves!
All the minds! Of all the times!
(What do you want with me?)
I want you to follow me, into the stars!
I want you to love me!
(I've fallen down now, and I won't get up)
(I've fallen down now, and I won't get up)
So many things to learn, my family!
I'm turning back!
I don't want to!
I'm turning away from the world!
I'm turning back!
I don't want to!
I'm turning away from the light!
Yeah!
These are only equations, this is only a problem!
Stay forward!
Stay the morning coma
What do you know?
I know why among the heavens, I don't know why among the living
I haven't a mind for those who give in
I don't know why? (Feelings I'm holding inside?) Why??
Childhood pain!
I want you to follow me, into the stars
Why don't we just leave?
To infinity, and surround!
And now, hunger does what sorrow could never do
Feed
Ladies! Ladies and gentlemen!
(carnival ensues)
See the four-faced boy
See the man with 17 testicles
See the child stand back and look into the infinite void
See the vagina-faced lady
Two for one
Indeed, I am your host, Ziltoid the Omniscient
Ladies and Gentlemen
My goal in this world is only to vacate the human mind
And twice now towards the sky, the men on the trampoline, the Flying Mangee Brothers, yes, flatulence, ladies and gentlemen free of charge
Remember your admission ticket to get one
Egads! Astounding! My worlds!
Ladies and gentlemen, I now see my life's purpose:
I am the mighty masturbator!
Amen1Embed
