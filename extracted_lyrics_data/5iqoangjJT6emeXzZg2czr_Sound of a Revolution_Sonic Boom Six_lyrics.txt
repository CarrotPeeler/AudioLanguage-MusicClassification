3 ContributorsSound Of A Revolution LyricsThere was a boy that I knew at school
Never wanted to break any rules
Never had many friends 'cos he weren't exactly cool
Treated like a fool to be fair
Never scored at footy so the other kids did not care
Just a nerd, till he heard them on the Word
Screaming "Fuck you, I won't do what you tell me!"
Went and brought the tape the next day
Within a week he's got the words in his memory
Jealous kids say "he's a cliche"
But man a-changing from the music that the band play
Walk the corridor with boots and his head shaved
Bully get him pissed, swing a fist and the boy say
"Fuck you, I won't do what you tell me!"
This is the sound of a revolution
They've come to take away all your uncertainty
And insecurities and spell an end to this confusion
Hey! Hey!
Blown out of your mind
Hey! Hey!
Leaving the old life behind in a song
This is where I belong for tonight
You might also likeAnd so the kid's alright now
Ring in his nose and rudeboy is a sight now
Scallys well want to bottle him other half cut their hair and want to follow him
Digging on the style of the bands that he borrowing
Running round the park and the playground hollering
"Fuck you, I won't do what you tell me!"
Isn't it strange the change of
One tune?
How the place in the space can trace to
One tune
How the grey of the day can fade when one tune put the colour in his life like Manga cartoons
Mic check, one two, Saturday afternoon having it large in the garage
As they run through
"Fuck you, I won't do what you tell me!"
This is the sound of a revolution
They've come to take away all your uncertainty
And insecurities and spell an end to this confusion
Hey! Hey!
Blown out of your mind
Hey! Hey!
Leaving the old life behind in a song
This is where I belong for tonight
Oh oh oh oh oh
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
So hear the sound of a revolution
As it accompany this new reality
And sing along with this conclusion
Oh oh oh oh oh
Hey! Hey!
Blown out of your mind
Hey! Hey!
Leaving the old life behind in a song
This is where I belong for tonightEmbed
