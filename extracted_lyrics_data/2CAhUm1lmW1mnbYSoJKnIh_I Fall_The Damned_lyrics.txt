5 ContributorsI Fall Lyrics
I've gotta full moon
A small room than I need
A candy store, a sexy whore
Yes I bleed
A sifting sand, an electric hand
Yes I'm fine
A souped-up truck or a goblin suck
Yes I'm blind

And I fall
Will I fall?
Will I fall?
Will I fall?

My mind's a raging blame
A crying shame and I'm sad
A city of sin, a bottle of gin
So dog-gone bad
A cool reaction for a big attraction
That's fine
A pissed off God, oh mother of God
Yeah I'm blind

And I fall
Will I fall?
Will I fall?
Will I fall?

I'm a falling angel
Falling down
Come be a falling angel
Won't you come around?
Don't be scared to follow
It's no crime
You're a falling angel
Before your time


And I fall
Will I fall?
Will I fall?
Did I fall?Embed
