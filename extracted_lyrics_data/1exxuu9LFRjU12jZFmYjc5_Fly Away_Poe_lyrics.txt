That the sky should break and the earth should shake
As if to say, sure it all matters but in such an unimportant way
As if to say, hey, hey
Fly away, sweet bird of prey
Fly, fly away, nothing can stand in your way
Sweet bird, if you knew the words
I know that you'd say, fly, fly away
It makes sense that it should hurt in this way
That my heart should break and my hands should shake
As if to say, sure it don't matter except in the most important way
As if to say, hey, hey
Fly away, sweet bird of prey
Fly, fly away, I won't stand in your way
Sweet bird, if you knew the words
I know that you'd say, fly, fly away
It makes sense that it should feel this way
That you slowly fade and yet still remain
As if to say, everything matters in such an invisible way
As if to say, it's okay, fly away
{Bye, bye, goodbye I'm back
Am I gonna get sued for saying that?
Call me later, see ya, I love you, bye
I'm gone, okay}You might also likeEmbed
