2 ContributorsLove, Hate, Revenge Lyrics
I bought a doll from an old bearded lady
I named it Tanya and it looks just like you
And though I know that it sounds a little crazy
I can make you feel anything I want you to

If I want you to cry, bet your life you're gonna cry
When I put two drops of water in this little doll's eye
So if I want to get even for what you did to me
All I gotta do is break its heart and you'll feel misery

Yes, now the shoe is upon the other foot girl
I'm in control of your subconscious mind
You're at my mercy the way I was at yours, girl
But my compassion is twice yours you'll find

If I want you to cry, bet your life you're gonna cry
When I put two drops of water in this little doll's eye
So if I want to get even for what you did to me
All I gotta do is break its heart and you'll feel misery
Ooh, hey!

If I want you to cry, bet your life you're gonna cry
When I put two drops of water in this little doll's eye
So if I want to get even for what you did to me
All I gotta do is break its heart and you'll feel misery
You might also likeIf I want you to cry, bet your life you're gonna cry
When I put two drops of water in this little doll's eye
So if I want to get even for what you did to me
All I gotta do is break its heart and you'll feel misery
If I want you to cry, bet your life you're gonna cry
When I put two drops of water in this little doll's eye
So if I want to get even for what you did to me
All I gotta do is break its heart and you'll feel miseryEmbed
