It's a fine day
There's nothing moving in the sky
It's a fine day
Cross my heart and hope to die

Stay with me baby
The love is in your eye
So good being alive
On a fine day

It's a new day
I feel so good this morning
It's a new day
There's a promise in the dawning

Stay with me baby
The love is in your eye
So good being alive
On a fine day

Oh, stay with me baby
The love is in your eye
So good being alive
On a fine day

It's a fine day
Now the story is unfolding
Oh, in his hands
In his hands our lives he's holding

Stay with me baby
The love is in your eye
So good being alive
On a fine dayEmbed
