2 ContributorsAttack LyricsSitting in my room at night
Feeling half dead
A dog two blocks away or more
Is howling in my head
My mind is getting dangerous
My body feels like lead
Icy horrors hit me, send shivers to my head
Attack attack
You can't fight back
Attack attack
An enemy you can't find
An enemy you can't find
Throat can't talk legs won't walk
Rooted am deaf and dumb
Terror rising in my gut
Makes my brain go numb
Something's creeping round the door
Something filled with threat
I bite a hole right through my lip
My back is trickling sweat
I taste blood inside my mouth
Am choking on the bile
I want to burst right out of here
I want to run a mile
The sickenss of the city
Is spreading thru the night
Someone else is screaming
To be let out for the nightSee The Exploited LiveGet tickets as low as $56You might also likeEmbed
