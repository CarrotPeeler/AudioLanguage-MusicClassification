3 ContributorsFunky Butt LyricsI thought I heard somebody say
Funky butt, stinky butt, take it away
'Cause I don't like it no how
You see that girl with the red dress on
She got the funky butt, stinky butt, sure as you're born
'Cause I don't like it no how
I thought I heard somebody say
Take it away, take it away
'Cause I don't like it no how
I just- wanna bolt and shout
Open the window, let the funk go out
'Cause I don't like it no howYou might also likeEmbed
