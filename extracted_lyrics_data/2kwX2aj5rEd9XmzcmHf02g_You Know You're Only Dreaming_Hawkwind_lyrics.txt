4 ContributorsYou Know Youâ€™re Only Dreaming LyricsOne more touch and then you'll see
A world of hidden mystery
Visions of you know you're only dreaming
Colours change, I stand upright
Screaming souls in the night
Visions of you know you're only dreaming
Chaos all within my mind
Wanna be with my own kind
Visions of you know you're only dreamingSee Hawkwind LiveGet tickets as low as $103You might also likeEmbed
