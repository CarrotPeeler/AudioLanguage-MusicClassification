7 ContributorsLowlife Lyrics
You know I'll be the one who gets falling down drunk
At my neighbor kid's soccer game
I've got an '82 Fiero with a car seat in the middle
Broken down on the interstate
I've got a beer-stained t-shirt, looking like Joe Dirt
Something 'bout me just ain't right
I'm a cash-stealing, drug-dealing loser without any feeling
Getting trailer trashed tonight

'Cause I'm a lowlife, and I'm loving it
I've got the whole damn world in the palm of my hand
I'm a lowlife, so fucking deal with it
No, you can't change something that you don't understand

I'm thrilled to be a hillbilly, hate to have to deal with me
Probably just end in a fight
No sleeves, can't read, doesn't even phase me
Naked, sleeping like a baby tonight

'Cause I'm a lowlife, and I'm loving it
I've got the whole damn world in the palm of my hand
I'm a lowlife, so fucking deal with it
No, you can't change something that you don't understand

Living it up, living it up
Being a lowlife

A gun-packing, bitch-smacking, mess with me, it's gonna happen
Loving life, living in sin
Passed out, on the floor, sorry, just don't work no more
Giving up on giving in
Ah, fuck it!

'Cause I'm a lowlife, and I'm lovin' it
I'm never gonna change as long as I live
I'm a lowlife, so fucking deal with it
'Cause deep down I really know everyone is

'Cause we're lowlives, and we're loving it
We got the whole damn world in the palm of our hands
'Cause we're lowlives, so fucking deal with it
No, you can't change something that you don't understand

Living it up, living it up
Being a low lifeEmbed
