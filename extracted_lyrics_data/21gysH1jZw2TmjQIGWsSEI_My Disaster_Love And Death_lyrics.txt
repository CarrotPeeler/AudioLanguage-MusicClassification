How can you watch me suffer?
How does it feel?
How do you stay so silent?
Will the time reveal?

You're the leader I follow
Am I a victim of circumstance?

Feeling everything, crashing down on me
Lost and so afraid, it's my disaster
Losing everything, giving all of me
I feel so betrayed in my disaster

How can you say you love me?
It's so unclear
I hope the pain will leave one day
With all the fear

You're the leader I follow
Am I a victim of circumstance?
You might also like
Feeling everything, crashing down on me
Lost and so afraid, it's my disaster
Losing everything, giving all of me
I feel so betrayed in my disaster

But I'll make it through
But I'll make it through
I've got to dominate, I will not tolerate it
Will I appreciate the pain that leads me to you?

Feeling everything, crashing down on me
Lost and so afraid, it's my disaster
Losing everything, giving all of me
I feel so betrayed in my disaster

But I'll make it through
My disaster
But I'll make it through
My disasterEmbed
