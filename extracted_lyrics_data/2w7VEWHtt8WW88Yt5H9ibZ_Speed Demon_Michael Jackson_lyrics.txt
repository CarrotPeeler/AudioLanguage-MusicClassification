Cho, cho
Cho, oh
Cho, cho
Cho

I'm headed for the border, it's on my mind
And nothing really matters, I've got to be on time
Look in the view mirror, is he hot on my tracks?
Is he getting nearer? I feel some heat is on my back

(Speed demon)
Speedin' on the freeway, gotta get a leadway
(Speed demon)
Doing it on the highway, gotta have it my way
(Speed demon)
Mind is like a compass, I'm stopping at nothing
(Speed demon)
Pull over, boy, and get your ticket right

Cho

Ain't nothing gonna stop me
Ain't no stop and go
I'm speeding on the midway
I gotta really burn this road
You might also like
(Speed demon)
Speedin' on the freeway, gotta get a leadway
(Speed demon)
Doing it on the highway, gotta have it my way
(Speed demon)
Mind is like a compass, I'm stopping at nothing
(Speed demon)
Just pull over, boy, and get your ticket right

Cho

Speed demon, you're the very same one
Who said, "The future's in your hands
The life you save could be your own"
You're preaching 'bout my life like you're the law
Gonna live each day and hour like for me there's no tomorrow
Go, go, go, aaow!

Cho, oh
Cho, cho
Cho
(Speed demon)
Speedin' on the freeway, gotta get a leadway
(Speed demon)
Got fire in my pocket like I just lit a rocket
(Speed demon)
Just pull over, boy, and get your ticket right
Ah, pull over, boy, and get your ticket right
Just pull over, boy, and eat your ticket
Pull over, boy, pull over, boy, and get your ticket right

Uh, ah, c'mon, hoo!

Pull over, boy, get your ticket right
Pull over, boy, get your ticket right
Pull over, boy, pull over, boy, and get your ticket
Eat your ticket, get your ticket
Eat your, get your—
Hoo, ah, ooh, ah
Get your ticket right
Hoo, ooh14Embed
