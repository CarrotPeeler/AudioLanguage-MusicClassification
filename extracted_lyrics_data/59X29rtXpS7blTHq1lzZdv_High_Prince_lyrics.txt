6 ContributorsHigh Lyrics
I'll get you high, yeah
Prince gonna get you high

I'll get you high, yeah
I'll get you high
I'll get you high, yeah
Prince gonna get you high

Making your way through the neighborhood
Looking for some good boys, toys
Bobbin' your tail to another one of Prince's jams
Trying to look real coy
When they pull up right beside you
And ask if they can ride you
Where the party at?
The horn goes beep
The music in the jeep goes

I got the music to get you high again
I got the beat that make you act like a hooligan
I got the rhyme, make you tell a friend
Prince gonna get you high
You might also like
I'll get you high, yeah
I'll get you high
I'll get you high, yeah
Prince gonna get you high

Every now and then, you're havin' one of them days
People gettin' on your last nerve, ooh
No matter how you cut it, nothing seems to go your way
You wanna quit this job
Get your swerve on, turn the radio up
It's a new day, the only way to see it is your way
The door goes slam
Now you sing this jam
Go

I got the music to get you high again
Got the beat that make you act like a hooligan
Got the rhyme, make you tell a friend
Prince gonna get you high

I'll get you high, yeah
I'll get you high
I'll get you high, yeah
Prince gonna get you high
How you gonna let another human stand in the way of this truth?
Put quarters in me, each quarter he's puttin' in the telephone booth
Oh!
25 to 1 you gon' have some fun
Put your hands up
Oh!
If y'all ready for the next run

Prince gonna get you high
Prince gonna get you high
Prince gonna get you high
Prince gonna get you high
Prince gonna get you high
Prince gonna get you high

I got the music to get you high again
Got the beat that make you act like a hooligan
Got the rhyme, make you tell a friend
Prince gonna get you high
I got the music to get you high again
Got the beat that make you act like a hooligan
All I wanna do is get you high
Get you high high high
Prince gonna get you high high high
Check it out
If you've ever been down real low
Put the jam in the jeep, let's go and get you high again
Every morning I'll get you high
Whenever you ain't feelin' too good, I'll get you high again
You don't need nobody, Prince gon' get you high
Ooh yeah, I'll get you high
Prince gon' get you high
Prince gon' get you highEmbed
