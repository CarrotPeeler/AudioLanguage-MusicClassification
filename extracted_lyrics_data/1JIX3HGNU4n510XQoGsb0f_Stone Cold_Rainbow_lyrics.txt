10 ContributorsStone Cold Lyrics
Every night I have the same old dream
'Bout you and me and what's in between
So many changes, so many lies
Try to run, try to hide
From everything that I feel inside
But I can't escape you or your frozen eyes

Searching in the darkness
Fading out of sight
Love was here and gone like a thief in the night

Stone cold
And I thought I knew you so well
Stone cold
Can't break away from your spell

Another dark and empty night
If I was wrong, I wanna make it right
But you are so distant, so far away
Your words like ice fall on the ground
Breaking the silence without a sound
Oh, familiar strangers with nothing to say
You might also like
Searching in the darkness
Fading out of sight
Love was here and gone like a thief in the night

Stone cold
And I thought I knew you so well
Stone cold, yeah
I can't break away from your spell
You leave me stone cold


Searching in the darkness
Fading out of sight
Love was here and gone like a thief in the night

Stone cold
And I thought I knew you so well
Stone cold, yeah
I can't break away from your spell
Stone cold, baby
I thought I knew you so well
You're stone cold, ice cold
Can't break away from your spell
You put me in the deep freeze (Stone cold)
Oh, baby, don't you leave me (And I thought I knew you so well)
Stone cold, you're leavin' me cold
(Can't break away from your spell)
Stone cold
I thought I knew you so well
Stone cold
Can't break away from your spell
Stone cold
And I thought I knew you so well
Stone cold
Can't break away from your spell
Stone cold
And I thought I knew you so well
Stone coldEmbed
