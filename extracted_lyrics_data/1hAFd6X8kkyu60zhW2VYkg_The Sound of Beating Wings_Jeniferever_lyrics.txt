1 ContributorThe Sound Of Beating Wings LyricsThey are leaving now
To the sound of beating wings
To images of a scenery
A scenery whose colours
Have started to fade
And whose brightness is passing away
Left us nothing but cold
It's not just in the air
It's the gap between us
It's in our voices as we speak
In sentences that we say
In words once beautiful
Saw you found something new
Something that's more for real
Not as fragile as we used to be
But would you cross the line for me?
For a second let your heart beat
The way it used to beat?
The would the words get thir meaning back
The sentences their depth
Our voices their warmth
And your eyes would they once again
Burn as bright as they once did?
Burn as if you were seventeen?

To the sound of beating wings
To images of a scenery
A scenery whose colours
Have started to fade
They are leaving now
Just like the easier days left us to die
Just like the loss of you
Left the scars that will always be a part of meEmbed
