3 ContributorsDone Bleeding Lyrics
Well you came to me in my disbelief
Suspicions runnin' wild confuse me
Too good to be true angel soaring free
My trust was broke when the devil used me

My battered heart
Was torn and ripped apart
Transgression into lies and treason

Well, I'm done bleedin', or so they say
I won't get in line to get thrown away
And I'm done bleedin', or so I'm told
Suck the blood straight from the stone

Stayed stinkin' drunk, frat house Magna Cum Laude punk
Toy for the mind, anything that soothes me, yeah
Taste my disease, I'm a masochist to please
My love for you drove me to rack and ruin

So if I seem uptight
Scarred from the switchblade knife
Scarred for life when the cut's done healing
See Sebastian Bach LiveGet tickets as low as $67You might also like
Well, I'm done bleedin', or so they say
I won't get in line to get thrown away
And I'm done bleedin', or so I'm told
Suck the blood straight from the stone

Come tap the vein
My heart remains the same
Keep beatin'
Done bleedin' (Done bleedin')
Oh


Well, I'm done bleedin', or so they say
I won't get in line to get thrown away
And I'm done feelin' times are tough
Strike me down, I'll get right back up at you

Straight from the stone
Straight out, straight out, straight out
Done bleedin'
Done bleedin'
Done bleedin'
Done bleedin'Embed
