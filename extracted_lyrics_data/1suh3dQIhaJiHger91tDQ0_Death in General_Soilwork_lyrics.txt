6 ContributorsDeath in General Lyrics
You went out of reach as quick as the setting sun
Nowhere else you could've gone
Still geraniums whispered your name that night
There was no one there who'd give you up

We all see changes but how the cut runs deep
(A shadow approaching)
Your pain is common, it's like revenge on repeat

How about driving souls apart
Like death in general
It's bound to shatter what you know
Cause pain is nothing
Recalling the way we used to dance
(Through gutters all built in distress)
I still mourn

The days turned to strangers
As soon as your life moved on
Infinity burned my fingers
One last look and then you're gone
You might also likeThe world crashing down on the innocent
The sky opening up for the truth
You were carried with honor and fiery eyes
Into unknown dominions where hearts reunite
Sail on, my flash in the night

How about driving souls apart
Like death in general
It's bound to shatter what you know
Cause pain is nothing
Recalling the way we used to dance
(Through gutters all built in distress)
I still mourn

The wind, the touch
The zenith, the iris
They'll never let go
They'll never let go

We all see changes but how the cut runs deep
(A shadow approaching)
Your pain is common, it's like revenge on repeat
How about driving souls apart
Like death in general
It's bound to shatter what you know
Cause pain is nothing
Recalling the way we used to dance
Recalling the last dance, my friend
My friendEmbed
