3 ContributorsNeeds Must the Devil Drives LyricsWhen the sun goes down
You come sneakin' around my door
You got me on the ropes
And I can't take any more
All through the daytime you're there
Pushing and a-shovin' me around
Sometime I wonder if I will ever survive
Needs must the devil drives
Try as I might
I never seem to get ahead
When the rooster crows
I've already left my bed
Mayhem in the traffic
Another truck rolls over on its side
Then the banker calls and tells me I'm taking a dive
Needs must the devil drives
Life is an automatic pay as you go
You won't get too far
If you ain't got no dough
Weighed down in debt
Your chips been fried
Ain't no place to run and nowhere to hide
Needs must the devil drives
When the sun goes down
You come sneakin' around my door
You got me on the ropes
And I can't take any more
All through the daytime you're there
Pushin' and a-shovin' me around
Sometimes I wonder if I will ever survive
Needs must the devil drivesYou might also likeEmbed
