12 ContributorsObvious Lyrics
Can you hear it in my voice?
Was it something I let slip?
Does the whole world know?
Isn't it obvious?
I'm the one who's in control
Now I'm acting like a fool
Do my feelings show?
Is my face aglow?
Isn't it obvious...

...That I don't know what I'm doing anymore?
I'm feeling like a little girl
Caught up in emotions
I'm out of control
Isn't it obvious?

Do you see my hands? They tremble
Wonder why I can't look you in the eyes
Don't know how long
I can keep this inside
Isn't it obvious?

Oh, I don't know what I'm doing anymore
I'm feeling like a little girl
Caught up in emotions
I'm out of control
Isn't it obvious?

Suddenly these emotions are in control of my heart
Can you see it in my eyes?
Every glance, every smile
Must give me away
And I feel so much I can't hide

And I don't know what I'm doing anymore
I'm feeling like a little girl, a little girl
Caught up in emotions
I'm out of control
Isn't it obvious?1Embed
