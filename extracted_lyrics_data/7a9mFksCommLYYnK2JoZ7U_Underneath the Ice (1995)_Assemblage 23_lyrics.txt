1 ContributorUnderneath The Ice (1995) LyricsI can feel the violence
Spill across the floor
My eyes have grown too clouded
To see it anymore
Fading into nothing
Turning into steam
Left in desperation
With nothing to redeem
Underneath the ice I find
A place to rest my weary mind
The cold deep water numbs my pain
Until I can face myself again
Waiting for redemption
That never seems to come
Hands reach beneath the surface
But I don't know where from
I'm not ready to return yet
I just need a moment more
So I can try to remember
What it is I came here for
Underneath the ice I find
A place to rest my weary mind
The cold deep water numbs my pain
Until I can face myself again
You might also likeI can feel the violence
Spill across the floor
My eyes have grown too clouded
To see it anymore
Sinking fast, too dark to see
The buzzing din envelopes me
Too late now, nowhere to go
I'm sinking in the undertow
Underneath the ice I find
A place to rest my weary mind
The cold deep water numbs my pain
Until I can face myself againEmbed
