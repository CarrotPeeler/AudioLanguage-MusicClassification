1 ContributorRockin Chair Blues LyricsIf you're feeling lowdown, don't have a soul to care
If you're feeling lowdown, don't have a soul to care
Just grab your hat and start for the Rocking Chair
There's Dubonnet Judy, Gin Fizz Flo
Cocktail Shorty, and old Julip Joe
I'm telling you, it's the gonnest place in town;
If you don't have your rubbers, take a taxi down
If you're a regular guy, you're bound to get a souvenir
If you're a regular guy, you're bound to get a souvenir
And when you write back home, you can say you're spooning at the Rocking CharYou might also likeEmbed
