Tune in, drop out of love
Pull the trigger, I'm a hippie
So said a truth, and blood
Alive and well
You push the buttons

Standing in line of fire
For the war, my soul
Step codes, the drums
And sing
Love the children
Learn to live with everything

Love, love, love, I'm the trigger hippie, yeah
Love, love, love, we are trigger hippie, here

Zoom in, cut out at sound
Make it feel so trippy
Hung up, let down to ground
Forget the kill, it's far too sticky

Love, love, love, I'm the trigger hippie, yeah
Love, love, love, we are trigger hippie, here
You might also like

Love, love, love, I'm the trigger hippie, yeah
Love, love, love, we are trigger hippie, here
Love, love, love, I'm the trigger hippie, yeah
Love, love, love, we are trigger hippie, hereEmbed
