3 ContributorsClosest Thing to Heaven LyricsHere they come
A lonely boy and a lonely girl
They can't say
Where they're goin'
Lonely...
With no money to spend
They can't sink
Any lower
Some people laugh all day
Some people cry, cry, cry
In the niight
This could be (this could be)
The closest thing to heaven
I have ever known (I've ever known)
I've ever known
Can't try
Can't try any harder
Whose turn is it now
To win while we loose
Livin'...
Is it at our expense
While we discover
Can't try, can't try
Any harder

Call me, call me, call me the king of fools...Embed
