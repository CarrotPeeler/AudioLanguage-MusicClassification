6 ContributorsMaster of Peace Lyrics
Warriors fighting
A thrill made of iron and steel
Charging horses
It's a never-ending wheel
Due to my orders
A thousand lives are gone
Screaming louder from the cliff
I feel as a master of peace
But I can't face what I see, what I feel
How to find my bliss?

Oh God I promised
We would go to war

The hills, the grass, the trees
Are slowly turning red
Forever and ever
These fields will taste of our blood
Father forgive me
'Cause I have no regrets, no complaints

Fifty thousand lost fallen souls
The victory needs sacrifice
And both of the armies
Have lost their half or more
I can't pay the price
You might also like
Oh God I promised
We would go to war

The hills, the grass, the trees
Are slowly turning red
Forever and ever
These fields will taste of our blood
Father forgive me
'Cause I have no regrets, no complaints


All victories have a price
The hills, the grass, the trees
Are slowly turning red
Forever and ever
These fields will taste of our blood
Father forgive me
'Cause I have no regrets, no complaints

I got no regrets no more
Oh God
