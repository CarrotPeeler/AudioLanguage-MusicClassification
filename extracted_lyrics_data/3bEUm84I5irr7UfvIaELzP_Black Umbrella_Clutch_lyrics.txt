5 ContributorsBlack Umbrella Lyrics
Money Mike, Pistol Pete
Both went running down the street
Police and snitches, lover’s lane
Hot summer. Hot rain
Hit the bricks
The girl got her tricks
She’s the Mississippi terror
And there’s none the fairer

O.T.B. was jammed
Paper changing hands
Nothing left but smoke and cellar
And a Woman with a black umbrella

Little Lewis lost his shit
10 to 1, couldn’t collect
Fish Head Phil, Itchy Ike…
Say they never got home that night
Shake the breaker
That girl ain’t no money maker
She’s come to cook all the books
And flaunt her good looks

O.T.B. was jammed
Paper changing hands
Nothing left but smoke and cellar
And a Woman with a black umbrella


O.T.B. was jammed
Paper changing hands
Nothing left but smoke and cellar
And a Woman with a black umbrella

O.T.B. was jammed
Paper changing hands
Nothing left but smoke and cellar
And a Woman with a black umbrellaEmbed
