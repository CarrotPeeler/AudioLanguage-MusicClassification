A company, always on the run
Our destiny, oh, it's the rising sun
I was a born, a shotgun in my hand
Behind the gun, I'll make my final stand, yeah

And that's why they call me...

Bad company
I can't deny
Bad, bad company
Till the day I die
Until the day I die
Until the day I die

Rebel souls; "deserters," we've been called
Chose a gun and threw away the sun
Now these towns, well, they all know our name
The Death Punch sound is our claim to fame

And that's why they call me...
Bad company
I can't deny
Bad, bad company
Till the day I die
Until the day I die
Until the day I die
Until the day I die

Eye for an eye
Tooth for a tooth
Blood for blood
We've all gotta die
We've all gotta die


And that's why they call me...

Bad company
I won't deny
Bad, bad company
Till the day I die
Bad company
I won't deny
Bad, bad company
Till the day I die
Until the day I die
Until the day I die
Until the day I die
Until the day I die
Until the day I dieYou might also like8Embed
