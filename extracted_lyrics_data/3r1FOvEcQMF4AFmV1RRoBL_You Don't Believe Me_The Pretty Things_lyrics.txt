3 ContributorsYou Don’t Believe Me Lyrics
You don't believe me
When I say I love you, babe
You don't believe
The things I say to you, babe
To make you understand
That's all I ask you to do
Don't keep me from your heart

You don't believe me
When I say, "I want you, babe"
You don't believe me
When I kiss you, babe
You can't help yourself
I've tried so hard to make you
I'm true to you, oh yeah

I will never leave you
I'll never try to see you
Oh no, oh no, no, no, no, no
All right, then!

You don't bеlieve me
Whеn I say I love you, babe
You don't believe
The things I say to you, babe
To make you understand
That's all I try to do
Don't keep me from your heart
You might also like
Don't keep me from your heart
Don't keep me from your heart...Embed
