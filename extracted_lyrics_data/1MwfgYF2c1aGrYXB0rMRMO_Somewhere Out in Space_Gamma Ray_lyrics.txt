1 ContributorSomewhere Out in Space Lyrics
I'm trapped in a castle of illusions out in space
No more illusions!
Out on a journey, on a mission for the human race
Terrified, I had to realize
That I've been talkin' to the gods of fire
I got nowhere to stand
'Cause I'm a running man...
To get away

All that I see is the years... somewhere out in space
And it's time for deliverance

Tomorrow, I'll see it, another day's rise
Right before my eyes
Been sinking in sorrow, but now I'm gonna rise
No more reasons why

I'm a watcher in the dark
I'm so cold inside my heart
I'm a temple in the storm
And I'm bound to be reborn
You might also like
Take me down to the underground
Let me see the gods of fire
'Cause I know where they live
And I know where they stand
Another reason there to leave
Take me down, take me down
Take me to the underground
Let me meet the gods of fire
And all of their intention is the center of it all

All that I see is the years... somewhere out in space
And it's time for deliverance
Now that I know
I've got to get away... somewhere out in space
I wanna know how to get away
Time for deliverance is now

And as the sun appeared, up in the sky
I saw another day that's drifting by
I saw my people cry a million tears
Into eternity, they disappeared

Now it's time to say goodbye
Or we will sink in sorrow
No, we don't know the reason why
Another day, tomorrow
Oh, I thank you for giving me hope
Oh, follow me into a new life

All that I see is the years
All that I see is the tears

All that I see is the years... somewhere out in space
And it's time for deliverance
Now all that I see is the fear... somewhere out in space
And it's time for deliverance
I wanna know how to get away... time for deliverance
I wanna know how to get away... time for deliverance
Come set me free, just set me free... time for deliverance
Just let me go...

I wanna get away, get away
I wanna get away, get away
Somewhere out in spaceEmbed
