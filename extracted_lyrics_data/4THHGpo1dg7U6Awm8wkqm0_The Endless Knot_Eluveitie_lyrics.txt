4 ContributorsThe Endless Knot LyricsAs the shore is not sea nor land
Like the time between the times
Where the dawning is not day nor night
You are between the worlds....
Endless circle, bearing my footprints
With fast-sure-hand you guide my steps
And so I trod on your endless paths
And travel on throughout eternity
In these labyrinths of life
Not to know what the next step will bring
And so I trust in your endless paths
And travel on throughout eternity
In these labyrinths of life
Not to know what the next step will bring
You keep the worlds aligned
You bond b'tween soul and flesh
You draw to the heart of hearts
With wisdom beyond fate
Endless knot, bearing my footprints
With fast-sure-hand you guide my stepsSee Eluveitie LiveGet tickets as low as $51You might also likeEmbed
