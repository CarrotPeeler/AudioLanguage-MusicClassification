2 ContributorsTrash Box LyricsYou're sticking to my finger
You smell like used before
Your skin to me tastes rotten
Let me lick a little more
First time we walked the junkyard
You said the magic words
Love should be decorated
With a little bit of dirt
More or less neglected
From backbone to the heart
It was more than I expected
And I knew it from the start
That you'd fit into my trash box
A perfect place to be
Although I know how much that cash sucks
I want you there for free
You're sticking to my finger
You smell like used before
Your skin to me tastes rotten
Let me lick a little more
Won't you fit into my trash box?
A perfect place to be
Although I know how much that cash sucks
I want you there for free
First time we walked the junkyard
You said the magic words
Love should be decorated
With a little bit of dirt
Won't you fit into my trash box?
A perfect place to be
Although I know how much that cash sucks
I want you there for free
I want you there for freeYou might also likeEmbed
