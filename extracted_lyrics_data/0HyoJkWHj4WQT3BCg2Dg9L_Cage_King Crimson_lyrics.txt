3 ContributorsCage LyricsWalking down the street, do you stare at your feet
And never do you let your eyes meet the freaks
The deadbeat addicts, social fanatics
They're a dime a dozen and they carry guns
Halloween, every other day of the week
Living in a cage in the USA
Living in a cage in the USA
Holy smoke! Somebody blew up the Pope
Living in a cage in the USA
All around us the rules are changing
Taller walls and stronger cages
Nothing is sacred or too outrageous
Taller walls and stronger cages
What in the world has happened to the world?
What in the world...
Driving your Mercedes you think you're safe
But there is no escape in a world of hateful
Criminal minds with guns and knives
Who say "give me a ride or give me your live"
Halloween, every other day of the week
Living in a cage in the USA
Living in a cage in the USA
Holy smoke! Somebody blew up the Pope
Living in a cage in the USA
You might also likeAll around us the rules are changing
Taller walls and stronger cages
Nothing is sacred or too outrageous
Taller walls and stronger cages
What in the world has happened to the world?
What in the world...Embed
