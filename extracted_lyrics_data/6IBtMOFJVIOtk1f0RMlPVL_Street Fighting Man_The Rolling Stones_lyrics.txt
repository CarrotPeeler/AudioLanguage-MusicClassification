Everywhere I hear the sound of marchin', chargin' feet, boy
'Cause summer's here, and the time is right
For fighting in the street, boy

Well now, what can a poor boy do
'Cept to sing for a rock-n-roll band?
'Cause in sleepy London Town
There's just no place for street fighting man
No

Hey, think the time is right for a palace revolution
But where I live, the game to play is compromise solution

Well now, what can a poor boy do
'Cept to sing for a rock-n-roll band?
'Cause in sleepy London Town
There's just no place for street fighting man
No

Get down
You might also like
Hey, said my name is called disturbance
I'll shout and scream
I'll kill the king, I'll rail at all his servants

Well now, what can a poor boy do
'Cept to sing for a rock-n-roll band?
'Cause in sleepy London Town
There's just no place for street fighting man
No

Get down
