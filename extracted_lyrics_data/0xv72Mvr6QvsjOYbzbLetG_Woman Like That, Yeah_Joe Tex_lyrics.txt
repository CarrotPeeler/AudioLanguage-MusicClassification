1 ContributorReal Life (F64) Lyrics
Yeah

I’m sorta nervous inside, but my hand is rock steady
Four man up in a black out Chevy
Run upon your face and we step in heavy
About to touch these kids, but we’re no R. Kelly
There are so many questions and I ain’t got the anwsers
Like, why your neek yutes wearing all that trapstar?
If you think you’re sick with it, I got the cancer
Puffin on the daily, call me rasta
Whole team out here, pushing tracks to the max
I’m speaking facts, Z and JJ know, for sure, I can't relax
We pull with the waps, make you run the laps
I’m only really striving for is the plaquеs, yeah
They tryna outshine mе, but I'm drawing the attention
All eyes on me right now, not to mention
How me and your girlfriend got the connection
My bars from the other world, different dimension
Decorate hall of fame with my platinum
Coldest in the scene and I'm sipping on some magnum
This the best shit you heard, not even an album
Go ask Casper how I'm hopping in that phantom
You might also likeDon't bother trying to excuse yourself
Screaming so loud, but your mumsy couldn't help
Not gettin’ rich by myself, I'm sharing wealth
The stories that I lived are the raps I tell
Voices in my head never let me sleep well
Woody feat a Sizer, that's a sequel
Don't even compare me and you, we're not equal
32 bars to you face, that was lethal
Stop cappin, you ain’t shottin’ no food
Walked on the stage and quickly got booed
Your boy was tryna chat shit, I’m not in the mood
I’m calling up Sizer if he’s tryna get rude

Real life (I’m wanna win)
Yeah, like 2 meals on a plane
Ask me, why I’ve got beef with a chicken
I ain’t never got time for these women (No way)
I might have Will Smith, man, if they ever try chat pon my woman
(Just like that) It’s calm, cos they probably wouldn’t
Nah, let me rephrase it, they couldn’t (Nah)
Try send for me, they shouldn’t (Nah)
It’s the way I walk out on stage, like all of a sudden (Sheesh)
Shu malak? Are you mad that the crowd was roary, no Joe Budden? (Yeah)
Big S and I’m so strong, incoming
They know me, I’m so so solid
21 questions or 21 seconds
2 sides of my sound and in still 21 blessed
21 sat on 21 and I don’t need no blessings
In my notepad I got more than 21 lessons for a rapper, if he wanna start messing
Did you get the message? (I want attention)
(Real life) Did you get the message?
See, I’m outside, real, real life
You better watch out, they hold real, real knives
See me, I’m calm, real, real nice
Real, real cool, it’s still have a sit, grab a stool
Or if you’re a G, bring a tool
I might bring two for an amateur, who’s tryna get rude
And get round there with my face all screwed
Who woulda knew? Your flows aren’t new
And your flows aren’t you
Try bite the sound and the scene my boycott a yute
Froze your assets
Still in my bedroom crafting classics
