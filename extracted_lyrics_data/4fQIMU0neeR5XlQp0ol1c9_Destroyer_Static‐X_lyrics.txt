9 ContributorsDestroyer Lyrics
Take it down with a steam hammer
Pack it hard
Lead shot in your mood shooter
Choose your poison
Have a drink with your painkiller
Take us down

Wreck a party like it don't matter
Smash it up, dead guitar
Broken beatmaker
If I could, I'd trade it all
For an automator
Here it comes

Oh, you do it again
You do it again
Destroyer
Oh, you do it again
You do it again
Destroyer

Cosmo-sucker
Bad-breath crier
Bad-timing robo-crap
You're a great liar
Overdrive, deep dirt
On your shit highway
Black-eyed
You might also like
Fuzzy filter
Hollow head wobble
Take a trip, get a grip
Before you get in trouble
And you wonder why
You're called the destroyer-stroyer
Stereo

Oh, you do it again
You do it again
Destroyer
(It's coming back again)
Oh, you do it again
You do it again
Destroyer
Oh, you do it again
You do it again
Destroyer
(It's coming back again)
Oh, you do it again
You do it again
Destroyer

Oh, you do it again
You do it again
Destroyer
(It's coming back again)
Oh, you do it again
You do it again
Destroyer

Take it down with a steam hammer
Pack it hard
Lead shot in your mood shooter
Choose your poison
Have a drink with your painkiller
Take us downEmbed
