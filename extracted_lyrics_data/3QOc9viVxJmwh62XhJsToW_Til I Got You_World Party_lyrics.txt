3 ContributorsEnd Of The World LyricsI hear the countdown
Am I the only one?
Is it in my head
Four, Three, Two, ONE!
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Every morning
Los Angeles
Sun is shining on dreams of the hopeless
California, burn it to the ground
Lets see the ashes all fall down!
Someone give me somethin I can scream out loud!
(Chorus)
Lets go crazy, waiting on the big show
Lets go crazy, everybody let go!
What if there is no tomorow?
For you and me baby, here we go girl
Party til the end of the world!
The end of the world
I'm holding your hand, we're in the front row
Stars are falling, and I'm never gonna let go
Sound the warning, if they only knew
I'll be okay as long as I've got you
Someone give me something I can scream out loud!

Lets go crazy, everybody let go!
What if there is no tomorow?
For you and me baby, here we go girl
Party til the end of the world!
The end of the world
Tick tock times up, god already hung up
Tell the lies, say goodbye, Tell me when it all falls down!
Lets go crazy, waiting on the big show
Lets go crazy, everybody let go!
What if there is no tomorrow?
For you and me baby, here we go girl
Lets go crazy, waiting on the big show
Lets go crazy, everybody let go!
What if there is no tomorow?
For you and me baby, here we go girl
Party til the end of the world!
The end of the world
Party til the end of the world
The end! The end! The end! The end!
Party til the end of the worldddddddddddEmbed
