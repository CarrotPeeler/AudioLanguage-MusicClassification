8 ContributorsSupermodel Robots Lyrics
Not quite a fem-bot
But almost an alien
She's in the smell of the month club
I feel it my lungs
Lesbian junkie-funky
Slam dunk cosmonaut
Well laser guns and having fun
Biological parking lot

All systems down
(All... All... All...)

So titty-twist a mad scientist
Oh, is this the toxic ride?
Wrap me up in a plastic bag
And hang me out to dry
Artificial respiration
I need my medication
Load me up and light a match
All systems down and out

It's down and out!
(All... All... All...)
You might also like

All systems down
(All... All... All...)

So titty-twist a mad scientist
Oh, is this the toxic ride?
Wrap me up in a plastic bag
And hang me out to dry
Lesbian junkie-funky
And slam dunk a cosmonaut
Well laser guns and having fun
Biological parking lot

All systems down
(All... All... All...)Embed
