22 ContributorsMercy Street Lyrics
Looking down on empty streets, all she can see
Are the dreams all made solid, are the dreams made real
All of the buildings, all of the cars
Were once just a dream, in somebody's head
She pictures the broken glass pictures the steam
She pictures a soul, with no leak at the seams
Let's take the boat out, â€‹wait until darkness
Let's take the boat out, wait until darkness comes

Nowhere in the corridors of pale green and grey
Nowhere in the suburbs in the cold light of day
There in the midst of it, so alive and alone
Words support like bone

Dreaming of Mercy Street, wear your inside out
Dreaming of mercy in your daddy's arms again
Dreaming of Mercy Street, I swear they moved that sign
Dreaming of mercy in your daddy's arms

Pulling out the papers from drawers that slide smooth
Tugging at the darkness, word upon word
Confessing all the secret things in the warm velvet box
To the priest, he's the doctor, he can handle the shocks
Dreaming of the tenderness, the tremble in the hips
Of kissing Mary's lips
You might also like
Dreaming of Mercy Street, wear your inside out
Dreaming of mercy in your daddy's arms again
Dreaming of Mercy Street, I swear they moved that sign
Looking for mercy in your daddy's arms

(Mercy, mercy, looking for mercy)
(Ooh-ah, looking for mercy)
(Mercy, looking for mercy)
(Looking for mercy, looking for mercy)
(Looking for mercy, looking for mercy)
Anne, with her father, is out in the boat
Riding the water, riding the waves on the sea3Embed
