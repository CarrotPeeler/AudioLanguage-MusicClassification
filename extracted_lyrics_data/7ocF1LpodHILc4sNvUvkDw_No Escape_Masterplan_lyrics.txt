1 ContributorNo Escape LyricsI save the tears that´s falling from your eyes
All to use another day
There´s no time to fear, regrets are all too late
They just fade away no matter how we try
You had your chance to make it right
But what went wrong
You don´t seem to fear what´s going on
On a lonely street you call my name
And we´re chained to our reality
Hard to belive we were ever younger
And how I felt your heart of gold
After all we´ve been through I wonder
No more escape for me
I have been closing my eyes for too long
I can´t remember your face
I will show you it´s more than a feeling
But it´s all too late

No way to escape from me
Now and forever I will keep you down
I have been closing my eyes for too long
I can´t remember your face
I will show you it´s more than a feeling
But it´s all too late
I will show you it´s more than a feeling
But it´s all too lateYou might also likeEmbed
