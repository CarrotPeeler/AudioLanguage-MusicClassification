1 ContributorTakinâ€™ Care Of Business LyricsNow the sun rises, in the morning
And the moon shines at night
There's a star, get together
That gives lovers a moonlit night
Well everything is business
Business makes the world go around
Now there's a time to do some hugging
And there's a time to rub that scrub
Ah there's a time to get together
And there's a time to make love
Well take care of business
Business makes the world go around
There's a time, and ther's a place
Oh jeez, make haste
One thing at a time
You know haste makes waste
You better take care of business
Business makes the world go around

You gotta stop on the red light
You gotta go on the green
Slow down on the yellow
And take it easy in between
Just take care of business
Business makes the world go around
You better take care of business
Business makes the world go around
Just take care of business
Business makes the world go aroundYou might also likeEmbed
