1 ContributorLove Died  LyricsHook: Falling In and out of love; a Nigga x2 was heart broke
She told me that she loved me I believed all the words that she spoke
Fed me lie after lie; I don't know why but I have to move on now
Uh !
All these hoes is ratchet x2 They is not about that life; they is not Wifey type
Verse:1 Fell In love twice, been heart broken twice
It's funny how it takes a while to get over a heart break but you can fall in love in 1 night
These hoes so difficult but they not so hard to get, I was looking for Mrs. perfect but I found the total opposite
She give the best brain but she not thoughtful, She was hard to forget she so Sarah Marshall
Love is a gamble to not fall is your best bet, So hungry for love I could have starved to death
Love can kill you but won't get charged with a felony, She apologized for breaking my heart; made her eat the humble that you won't ever find at a bakery
Blowing my phone up; block yo ass like jeff saturday it's the weekend, on sunday I asked yo bitch to fuck she say's no as much as a yes man
I'm through wit that commitment shit; even before I was done wit it my mind set was to never get married
Cause these chicks want a fossil fuck that shit I give em dinosaur dick
I have no feelings like Azoospermics, You hoes can't have my heart but you can get my love stick
For lunch; none of my bitches lame, only time I can hit a l is when that bitch in a blunt
I like my chicks red like michael; Phelps, Light one up then swim in yo bitch; she hang around all niggas she is like pubic hair she love to be around dicks
Got a trick did her for 60 minutes; the hour was magic johnson is what I gave the bitch, she used me for my cheese dats a rat for you; fuck that ratchet ass trick
You fall in love you pay the price; love be bussin heads I got my stitches bitches
Hook: Falling In and out of love; a Nigga x2 was heart broke
She told me that she loved me I believed all the words that she spoke
Fed me lie after lie; I don't know why but I have to move on now
Uh !
All these hoes is ratchet x2 They is not about that life; they is not Wifey type, They is not about that life
You might also likeVerse:2 I remember getting dumped by this bad bitch but one thing I knew; she still wanted to fuck wit I cause after dat she went to school to be an Opthamologist
I had to rehab after she lefted me cause her pussy was so dope, she was the popping pill type; she was my drug but she love E like The bear's coach
My heart told me I hate the hoes, my brain told me not to think about the hoes, My dick told me to put a rubber on so I won't get yall prego
Wait for love I ain't rushing shit dats laxatives, ain't tripping off a ho; I'm In love wit the game when I breakout I won't need proactive
I ain't worried bout nothing less I'm having sex, you hoes are like blue flags cause you just get left
All these hoes love l.T. I ain't talking bout ladainian tomilinson they be running back; I be moving foward
Know some bitches who strip together they den been in more laps than Jeff gordon
Hoes talk a lot; when money talks is the only time I deal wit a loud mouth, I don't play with hoes unless it involves me putting my hand up a blouse
Yo chick give me some good brain; I don't fuck with hoes with learning disabilities, Believe it or not word to Ripley's
She wasn't that bad I can't even lie but she had some twins and she wasn't a Gemini
When I first her she said whip yo dick out; I ain't ashamed so I let her see it, I den showed a lot of hoes my private part so it's not a secret
Fuck em maybe dj want em, In the past I left my chick jennifer for angelina; brad pitt on em
I don't lie I don't tell stories; I never been with the bull even tho I had a chick that was a taurus
My ex say she gone get a million before I do; opposite day is the day she win, only way she beat me is if I let her jerk me off again
It's a lot of girls kissing girls, 2 bitches devour each other damn they really think it's a dog eat dog world
Holy Shit that is nasty, they think it's cool but they ass ratchet
Bridge: All des is ratchet, they think it's cool but that shit is ratchet
All des hoes is ratchet x2, my brother told me all these hoes is ratchet
Hook: Falling in and out of love a nigga x2 was heart broke
Told me that she loved me I believed all the words that she spoke
Fed me lie after lie, I don't know why but I have to move on now
Forget love, have fun, pass the slut, don't give a fuck
Uh!
Most girls are ratchet x 2 I say all des hoes is ratchet
They is not about that life, they is not wifey type
They is not about that life x3 They is not wifey typeEmbed
