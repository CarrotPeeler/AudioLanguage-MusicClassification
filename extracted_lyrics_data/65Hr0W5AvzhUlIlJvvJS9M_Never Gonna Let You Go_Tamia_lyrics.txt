3 ContributorsNever Gonna Let You Go LyricsOoh oh yeah
I don't even know the reason why
You tell me that you it's time to say goodbye
You can't even look me in my eye
Did i do something wrong
If you tell me that the love is gone
I'll move over and i'll let you move on
But i know that the love is still strong
So i keep holding on
Chorus:
So i'm never gonna let you go even though it's breaking my heart
All trying to do is let you know
We can make a new start
So i'm never gonna let you go even though it's tearing me apart
All i'm trying to do is let you know
We can make a new start
I remember back when we first met
The kind of love that you never forget
Making love till we were soaking wet
And you're still on my mind oh
After all things that we've been through
You gotta give me time to talk to you
That's the very least that you can do
We can work it out with time
You might also likeWe can start all over again
Whatever it gets
I'll make it right
Whatever you need i will provide
I really want you in my life
We can make a new start
Whatever i will be there
The love that i give none can compare
All that we have all that we share
We can make a new start
I'm gonna hold on
Said i'm gonna be strongEmbed
