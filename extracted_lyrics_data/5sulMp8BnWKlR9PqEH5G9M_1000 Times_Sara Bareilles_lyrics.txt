9 Contributors1000 Times Lyrics
Back of the room
Looking at you
Counting the steps
Between us
A hundred and five
Little blades in a line
From your skin to mine
And I feel it
Eyes on the ground
But I can't look up now
Don't wanna give it away
My secret

In another life
My teeth and tongue
Would speak aloud what until now
I've only sung

'Cause I would die to make you mine
You bleed me dry each and every time
But I don't mind, no I don't mind it
I will come back 1000 times
You can make me wait forever
Push me away and tell me never
But I don't mind, no I don't mind it
I will come back 1000 times
You might also like
Kiss me goodnight like a good friend might
And I'll do the same, but won't mean it
'Cause love is a cage, and these words on a page
Can carry the pain, but they don't free it

In another life, I wouldn't need to
Console myself as I resign to release you

'Cause I would die to make you mine
You bleed me dry each and every time
But I don't mind, no I don't mind it
I will come back 1000 times
You can make me wait forever
Push me away and tell me never
But I don't mind, no I don't mind it
I will come back 1000 times

Again, again I let it go, let it go
Cover my mouth
Don't let a single word slip out
I wouldn't wanna tell you, no, tell you, no
Nothing could be worse
Than the risk of losing what I don't have now
I'm weaker by the minute, though
Is it so bad if I wanna cry outâ€“
That I would die to make you mine?
You bleed me dry almost every time
But I don't mind, no I don't mind it
I will come back 1000 times
Make me wait forever
Push me away and tell me never
But I don't mind, no I don't mind it
I will come back 1000 times
I will come back 1000 times
Hey, hey
I will come back 1000 times3Embed
