5 ContributorsGarden of Dreams Lyrics(Chapter 1 - Supernatural Appearance)
Awaken! From my rest...
Something is... Grabbing my senses
Something is... Pulling my roots
... Half conscious... Levitating from my bed?
I stood up! In sweat
As my pores... Were burning! By...
It is...
Awaken from my rest!
Something!... Grabs me?
Still confused...
Something... Levitates from me?
Awaken in sweat!
My pores redeem heat...
It is...
Him!
I reach my dim door!
Opening it, reveals...
Vapors of blood in the air that succumb...
Into the scent of nothingness...
Glancing beyond...
My body is being hurled through the air!
Spinning invertedly...
The head fragments in shards...
Carved in his flesh! Alive on my chest!
Burns the sigil of baphomet...
The specter marches the chamber...
Through my steps? I stumble with the residue...
Facing skywards! Drips my inhuman degeneration...
Excrement's blasted apart surround my images...
Fumes putrifoed form the opaque glass...
Regardless... Sonic vibrations...
Mirror! Mirror! Face to fae!
I only see, the shadow...
... Reflecting off the glass!
That mirror shatters my soul... Black blood hole...
... Propels infinite falseness
Explodes
Releases ultra - sonorise resonance
Receive...
Pallesthesicly
I'm willing to kill me
That dark effigy deep in the well
Of disgust...
Unnature, undead
Maleficent destroyer!
Revelation...
Peers reflection
Abomination...
Reflects possession
Manifestation...
Possesses creation
Penetration...
Creates domination
Clairvoyance...
I'm dark... I'm pure silence...
A dream... Or the shadow gate truth...
Open to the smell?
Abomination...
Demon, abominations!You might also likeEmbed
