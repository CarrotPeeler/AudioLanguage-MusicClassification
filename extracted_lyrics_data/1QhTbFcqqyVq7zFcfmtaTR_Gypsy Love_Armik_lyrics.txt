5 ContributorsComing Home Lyrics
The return is not as easy as i thought
The years have taken toll and been unkind
A thousand memories which i forgot
Now resurrect and march across my mind
The drummer beats his drum the armies roar
And at my back I hear the choir sing
A song of hope forgone
A mourning for bitter pain the coming fire brings
I stand upon the fields my father stood
The sweat runs down my back, as I decide
To stand and Fight, to battle for the good
And die where greater men than me have died

(Coughs) You ready?
Lego
You already know
Illegal Music 2 baby, Yeah

Do you still think of me I just wanted to know
You've been a lover of mine forever ago
Right now it feels as if I have nowhere to go
My worlds turning slow, so I'm coming home to you
To you (3x)
You might also like
Did you miss me?
While I was gone did anyone eclipse me?
Gist me, not them they be gone in bout 60
But M.I. is one for all history
I've been brewing more of my whiskey
Have a sip see, let's get tipsy
Then Lose Yourself and get risky
Cuz this is for the grown and sexy
Now my dough nuts cuz you bless me
Yes sir my cream is more Krispy
Make money blow bills Lewinsky
Cuz the Moniker for greatness is me
So let's get this s*** done briskly
I return in good faith you can frisk me
I'm trying to take you around the world like a gypsy
Until it's blasting overseas like a jet ski


Did you wait long?
Did Illegal music 2 take long?
Did you lose hope or is your faith strong?
See I just needed time to take a break from
All this mediocrity and usher in new sounds
'Cos R Kelly's being in love with the same song
I'm the new school chef n*****, Raekwon
The flow is nuts, acorn
Illegal music Free no Mason
It feel like Halloween no Jason
M.I. Africa's Hip Hop liaison
I'm connecting with the past that they say is gone
But futuristic still get My space on
I treble this other rappers like they bass gone
And their face gone down
When they heard that I was coming back around
Listen nigga you should stay strong
You should stay strong, yeah

Breakfast time i stare
Across the table at an empty chair
Life's so lonely living without you
The whole day i just think about you
But when i walk through my bedroom door
That's when my tears begin to fall
Because two lovely pillows
On a king sized bed
Make one lonely night
When only one lays their head
Loneliness is staring me in my faceEmbed
