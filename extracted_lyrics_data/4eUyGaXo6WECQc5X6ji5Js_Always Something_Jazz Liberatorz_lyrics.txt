2 ContributorsAlways Something LyricsSometimes when youre lying beside me, in your eyes I see
I dont know but its something, its something
And its trippin me up again
Its like youre here but youre not here, I need to know where
But you won't let me go there
Always telling me its nothing, its nothingWell I had a vision
Of a lover in my best friend
Its not like me to questionSomething always gets in between
It twists and it turns, you know that it seems to me
Lately, Im so unsure, I can't put my finger on it, on it
Strange feeling ripping at the seams
And Ive never heard the sound of my heart breaking
Like this before, before there was always something, somethingI think back on the days when we were falling, it was so good then
Never worried bout a thing, no nothing
Well its funny how things change
Now a cold wind is blowin
But I was hoping its not the start of a bitter end
Could it be that you're something is someone elseOnly time will tell
I thought I knew me so well
I shouldn't, I shouldn't put me through this hellSomething always gets in between
It twists and it turns, you know that it seems to me
Lately, Im so unsure, I can't put my finger on it, on it
Strange feeling ripping at the seams
And Ive never heard the sound of my heart breaking
Like this before, before there was always something, somethingSomethings always getting in between
And its always rippin at the seams, yeah
Somethings always messing with my vision
Its not like me to question, heySomething always gets in between
It twists and it turns, you know that it seems to me
Lately, Im so unsure, I can't put my finger on it, on it
Strange feeling ripping at the seams
And Ive never heard the sound of my heart breaking
Like this before, before there was always something, somethingCome on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on, yeah
Before there was always something
Before there was always somethingYou might also likeEmbed
