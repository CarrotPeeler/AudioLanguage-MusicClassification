3 ContributorsSure Got Cold After the Rain Fell Lyrics
Rain fell this mornin', make me feel so bad
On account of my baby
Walked off with another man
Like taking eyesight from the blind man
And money from the poor
That woman took my loving
And walked on out that door

And it sure got cold after the rain fell
Not from the sky, from my eye

Somebody, can you tell me
Just what make a man feel this way?
Like river without it’s  water
Like night without a day

And it sure nuff’ got cold after the rain fell
Not from the sky, but from my eye

If you're home early in the morning
You hear that rain to fall
With thunderbolts and lightning
The wind begins to call
Your worry's superficial
Because you slept on through the night
But stormy weather keep you wondering
If everything's all right

And it sure nuff' got cold after the rain fell
Not from the sky, but from my eye
Not from the sky, from my eyeEmbed
