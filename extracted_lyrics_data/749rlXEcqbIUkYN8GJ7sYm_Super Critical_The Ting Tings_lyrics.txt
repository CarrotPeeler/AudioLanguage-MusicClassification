Super critical girl
Taking over the world
Super critical world
Taking over the girl

Given now you're forty-four
Come on, then you can stay alive
Even that drum I'm beatin' on
Get it away, I wanted more
Given that we do what we do
Someone get up and pay the guy
Never can have this anymore
Think I might turn into

Super critical girl
Taking over the world
Super critical world
Taking over this girl

Cinema con it, do the one
If anyone's got a need, come alive
What if we all get off our face?
What if we all go all the way?
Being the one that's seeing the most
Look at you walking in the door
Look at you coming back for more
Twenty-one times a day
