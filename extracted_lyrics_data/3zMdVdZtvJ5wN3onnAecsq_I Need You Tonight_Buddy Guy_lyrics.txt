2 ContributorsI Need You Tonight LyricsIt's three o'clock in the morning
And the rain began to fall
I know what I need
'Cause I don't have it all
I'm needing someone like you
That I can do love to
Baby, baby
I need you tonight
Outside my window
It's lonely and cold
Inside my heart there's a fire
Burning out of control
Burning for someone like you
I just wanna do love to
Baby, baby
I need you tonight
Your love is coming to me
Like a wolf howlin' at the moon
But that just won't do me
'Cause I can't get you soon
I'm calling for someone like you
That I can do love to
Baby, baby
I need you tonight
You might also likeI need you tonight
Callin', callin', callin', callin'
Honey I need you tonightEmbed
