6 ContributorsPiss-Bottle Man LyricsThere are some things
A guy gets from his pop
Some of them things get spaced
Others never forgot
I got such a tradition
I keep in my truck cab
Ooh, ooh, ooh piss-bottle man
Miles and miles and all the while
I feel secure
Even if the fuse gets short
I know I can keep my nerve
I believe in such a tradition
I got it in my truck cab
Ooh, ooh, ooh piss-bottle man
Driving in his shoes
Using the bottle he used
Everytime I pop I think
Of my pop and pay my dues
I respect such a tradition
A shrine in my truck cab
Ooh, ooh, ooh piss-bottle manYou might also likeEmbed
