1 ContributorMacArthur Park LyricsThere will be another song for me
For I will sing it
There will be another dream for me
Someone will bring it
I will drink the wine while it is warm
And never let you catch me
Looking at the sun
But after all the loves of my life
After all loves in my life
You'll still be the one
I will take my life into my hands
And I will use it
I will win the worship in their eyes
Then I will lose it
I will have the things that I desire
And my passion flow
Like rivers through the sky
But after all the loves of my life
After all the loves of my life
I'll be thinking of you
And wondering why
I will have the things that I desire
And my passion flow
Like rivers through the sky
But after all the loves of my life
After all the loves of my life
I'll be thinking of you
And wondering whyYou might also likeEmbed
