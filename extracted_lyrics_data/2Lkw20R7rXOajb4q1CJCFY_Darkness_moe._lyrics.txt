1 ContributorDarkness LyricsWhen you're movin slow enough
It's like it's not really happening
When you're movin slow enough
It's like it's not really happening
Who ya gonna blame when the rain comes in?
Who ya gonna blame when the rain comes in?
Got a 40 mile fence made of bones and tin
The waters gettin higher as the rain falls in
Lalalalalala, lalalalalala. lalalalala la
Who ya gonna blame when the rain comes in?
Who ya gonna blame when the rain comes in?
Every tub every bucket every cup and every bin
All filled to the top overflowin at the brim
Lalalalalala, lalalalalala. lalalalala la
When you're movin slow enough
It's like it's not really happening
When you're movin slow enough
It's like it's not really happening
Lalalalalala, lalalalalala. lalalalala la
