2 ContributorsMe And My Crazy Self LyricsMe and my crazy self
Let a woman make a fool outta me
Me and my crazy self
Let a woman make a fool outta me
Now she went away and left
I'm as lonesome as a fool can be
Me and my lying self
Said I wouldn't love no more
Me and my lying self
Said I wouldn't love no more
Now that woman took my heart
And she walked right out the door
Me and my helpless self
Guess theres nothing I can do
Me and my helpless self
Well there's nothing I can do
But just
Crying my heart out over youYou might also likeEmbed
