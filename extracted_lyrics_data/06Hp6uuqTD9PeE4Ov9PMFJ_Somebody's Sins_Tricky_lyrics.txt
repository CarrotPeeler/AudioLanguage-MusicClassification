3 ContributorsSomebodyâ€™s Sins Lyrics
Jesus died for somebody's sins but not mine
Meltin' in a pot of thieves wild card up my sleeve
Thick, heart of stone; my sins, my own they belong to me
People say "Beware!" but I don't care
The words are just rules and regulations to me, me

Jesus died for somebody's sins but not mine
Meltin' in a pot of thieves wild card up my sleeve
Thick, heart of stone; my sins ,my own they belong to me
People say "Beware!" but I don't care
The words are just rules and regulations to me, me

Jesus died for somebody's sins but not mine
Jesus died for somebody's sins but not mineYou might also likeEmbed
