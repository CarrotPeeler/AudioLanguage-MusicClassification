Come on over, it's getting late
It's time to fish, no time to cut bait
Ghoulish passion you inspire
With your kind of trouble I'll never tire

Monster (monster in me)
Bring out the monster (monster in me)

In a world full of disposable icons
And all the jokers with the phony come-ons
I know I can depend on you
Cause when we're together, we're hurtin' crew

Monster (monster in me)
Bring out the monster (monster in me)
Monster (monster in me)
Bring out the monster (monster in me)
You bring out the monster in me


We don't need to look for trouble
My partner in crime, my insanity double
When life takes a turn from bad to worse
You're always there, my loveable curse
You might also like
Monster (monster in me)
Bring out the monster (monster in me)
Monster (monster in me)
Bring out the monster (monster in me)
You bring out the monster in me
The monster in youEmbed
