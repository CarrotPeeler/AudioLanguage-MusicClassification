Standing in the night
Underneath the glass and light
Where her love remains
The pain, doesn't fade, but it's a brighter shade of grey

You're, my little white lie (But do you know)
You're, my little scare (I make me feel)
You're my little white lie
For you, I'll always be there, be there
You're my little white lie (But do you know)
You're, my little scare (I make me feel)
You're, my little white lie
For you, i'll always be there, be there

Glowing blue and white
Caught within your line of sight (Caught within, your line of sight)
Cut me like a knife (Cut me like a knife)
But instead, of the steel, it's the warmest touch i feel

You're, my little white lie (But do you know)
You're, my little scare (I make me feel)
You're my little white lie
For you, I'll always be there, be there
You're my little white lie (But do you know)
You're, my little scare (I make me feel)
You're, my little white lie
For you, i'll always be there, be there
You might also like
It's scary out there
Much more than you can bear
But I'll, protect you, protect you, my dear
You're my, little white lie
You're my, little scare

You're, my little white lie (But do you know)
You're, my little scare (I make me feel)
You're my little white lie
For you, I'll always be there, be there
You're my little white lie (But do you know)
You're, my little scare (I make me feel)
You're, my little white lie
For you, i'll always be there, be there

You're my, little white lie
You're my, little scare
You're my, little white lie
For you, i'll always be there
You're my, little white lie
You're my, little scare
You're my, little white lie
If it comes to you, I'll always be there
