6 ContributorsLove Only Leaves You Lonely Lyrics
They say it gets better
But it's bittersweet
You don't know how it feels
To sleep right where you used to be
And your smell it still lingers
I need to wash my sheets
They're stained with memories
I wonder if you think of me

Forever really don't (Don't)
Last too long
'Cause all I had to give (Give)
Was not enough

Oh love just left me lonely
I ain't got nobody to call my own
Oh, love just made my heart ache
Always a mistake
Oh, love only leaves you lonely

I sleep with the TV on
And write the saddest songs
Cigarettes and alcohol
Have become my only escape
I dream of my baby child (Of my baby child)
Know I'll have to wait while
It hurts so much to smile
And even the strongest can break (Even the strongest can break)
You might also like
Forever really don't (Don't)
Last too long (Too long)
'Cause all I had to give (Give)
Was not enough

Oh love just left me lonely (Love, love, love, love)
I ain't got nobody to call my own (Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh)
Oh, love just made my heart ache (Love, love, love, love)
Always a mistake (Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh)
Oh, love only leaves you lonely

(Ha, ahh-ahh-ahh)
I'm left with nothing but a twisted dream (But a twisted dream)
There must be someone out there who won't abandon me (Abandon me)
'Cause I give so much, but all they ever do is take

Oh love just left me lonely
I ain't got nobody to call my own
Oh, love just made my heart ache (Love, love, love, love)
Always a mistake (Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh)

'Cause love, 'cause love only leave you lonely
Yeah-yeah, oh yeah
Love just left me lonely
Love just left me lonely
To call my own
Oh, love just made my heart ache
Always a mistake
'Cause love only leaves you lonely
YeahEmbed
