We gon' give him a little bitty bit, we'll give you a small portion (Yeah)
But now don't you want no more, boy
You better get away from there if you start asking for too much

You got it, Fred!
(Fred Thomas bass solo)
That's that Washington Road—Washington, Georgia I mean, not D.C

Excuse me, Friendly
Cheese, can you play in the key of F?

Fred, I hate to say it, can you find the key of F on there?
Can you find the key of F? Okay. On my count—
I'm not gonna count it off, I'm just gonna drop my hand
And then when you hit F, I'ma pick it up off the floor
I mean *laughs* I'm sorry
F, now hit it, uh, ah, in the pocket, in the pocket
Fred, can I ask the man with the little horn to play a little bit for us?
That's alright, you can use that little one, ol' Sherlock, I mean, Maceo
Now, get down! Now
Excuse me while I go back to the organ and play it like I play a piano
