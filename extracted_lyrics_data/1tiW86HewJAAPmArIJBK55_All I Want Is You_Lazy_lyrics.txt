2 ContributorsYou Lyrics
You wanna feel love
I’ll show you real love
Cause you wanna feel loved too
I wanna know real love
Kinda like you

I saw your sister on the way home
I told her I was out of credit and was headed for a pay phone
I was gonna call you on it
And I ain’t gonna lie
I know you saw it comin’
I didn’t wanna let another day go
Without sayin’ what I wanted
You can take notes if you need to
I’ma open up
Normally it’s case closed on my feelings
Now I’ve spoken up
I’ma face those
Cause me and you were different
You listen
Watchin’ minutes slippin’ couple hours later
Now I’m thinking out aloud bout how I’m jaded
How I haven’t felt a thing since it’s ended
I’ve been waiting
Sometimes you gotta live for the moment
Don’t be hatin’ when we own it
Now I’m over at your crib
Smashing hips on ya sofa
Afterwards I had to say it
You might also like
I’ll raise you up
I won’t sell you out
I won’t bring you down
No more
Hold me up
Call me out
I won’t bring you down
Again
Again

When I think about you…
I feel this way
Let me start again
All I want is you…
Lay your body next to mine
Tell me you don’t feel the same

You wanna feel love
I’ll show you real love
Cause you wanna feel loved too
I wanna know real love
Kinda like you
For the thrill of it
Divine and intimate
Pluck the strings while the birds and the bees
Set the key of our instruments
And bear with me now
I think we’re onto something
You can be my Juliet
We can fuck all night like newlyweds
Kickin’ off the covers and
I’m just being honest so
Take solace in the fact I’ll
Try never break a promise again
Instead
Let me sing another sonnet
Put some honour in a track and dedicate to a goddess

I’ll raise you up
I won’t sell you out
I won’t bring you down
No more
Hold me up
Call me out
I won’t bring you down
Again
Again
When I think about you…
I feel this way
Let me start again
All I want is you…
Lay your body next to mine
Tell me you don’t feel the same
Here’s looking at you
I feel this way
Let me start again
All I want is you
Lay your body next to mine
Tell me you don’t feel the same

You wanna feel love
I’ll show you real love
Cause you wanna feel loved too
I wanna know real love
Kinda like youEmbed
