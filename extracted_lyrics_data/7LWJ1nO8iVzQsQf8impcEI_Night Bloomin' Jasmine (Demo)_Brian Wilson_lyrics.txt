2 ContributorsNight Bloomin’ Jasmine (Demo) Lyrics
Night bloomin' jasmine
It comes a-creeping through my window
Night bloomin’ jasmine
While I'm a-sleeping near my window

I smelled, I smelled, I smelled it for the very first time
I want, I want, to kiss cousin so sublime


Can you remember
A night in June while you were walking
And suddenly it comes over you
And you stop talking

The night, the sky, she whispers something in my ear
We kiss, it's bliss and all I need in life is here


Night bloomin’ jasmine
It comes a-creeping through my window
Night bloomin' jasmine
It comes a-creeping through my window
Night bloomin' jasmine
While I'm a-sleeping near my window
Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo doo-doo-doo-doo doo
