2 ContributorsJane Doe LyricsCan I explain it?
It's not an easy thing to do
A cryptic fascination
Seems to get me through
A darkened stranger
Who left me full of doubt
She'd tell me that she loved me
Then the lights went out
Jane Doe, what was her name
Where did she go
Jane Doe, she slipped away again
Does anybody know?
Jane Doe
Platonic whisper
That makes me want to shout
Then she always dissapears
Like a lady from a Barclay House
Who is this woman
Someone that I invent
I follow all night long
Like a bloodhound on a scent
Jane Doe, what was her name
Where did she go
Jane Doe, she slipped away without a trace
I still don't know
Jane Doe

Love can twist the brain
This picture lost it's frame
And John has lost his Jane
Was that her name
Jane Doe, what was her name
Where did she go
Jane Doe, she slipped away again
Does anybody know?
Jane Doe
There's no fault, no blame
Love can twist the brain
This picture lost it's frame
And John has lost his JaneEmbed
