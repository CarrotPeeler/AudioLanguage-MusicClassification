4 ContributorsStation Lyrics
Was it in a dream? I wouldn't know
I was in the lowlands where all the old folks go
I wasn't here, I wasn't home
I was picking static up on a broken radio

Just leave me at the station and you can rest assured
That I'll be back sometime this time next year

I'll pack my bags, you get the door
Here's a stack of tokens for my friends on Baltimore
That look on your face, I've seen it before
I'll be gone, a long time, but I could be gone for more


I need someone
I need something
I need to go back homeSee Dr. Dog LiveGet tickets as low as $75You might also likeEmbed
