3 ContributorsTorn Lyrics
The Virus

I'm high off you and I hope I don't need jetlag
Falling from the sky when you let me come down
You challenging me like you throwing a red flag
And it don't feel the same when you don’t come around, so when you coming back?
Even though we toxic it don't burn that fast
You can throw sticks and stones, but it don't hurt that bad
We can talk money problems let me work this bag
Spend 3K easy like we're Ku Klux Klan
Who want what, damn
Just keep a distance I'm in my mood
I don't need assistance, I need someone I can lean on and oil my hinges
Stuff a 'Wood with the highest weed then sleep until dinner
Appreciate mе for me and let my mind go free
My thoughts go wild, I speak, but thеse words ain't cheap
The blackest of sheep, you listen, but they ain't heard my speech
They try to neuter my dogs, but my dogs too deep
We're out of reach to these fuck niggas
How you laying down if you up with niggas
I'm uptown with some good guys and drug dealers
Ghetto love stories, toxic territories
I'm like Dexter making shit in my laboratory
This shit is mandatory, you ain't got no other choice
Speak for yourself 'cause you can't come up with another voice
6'1, if I stand on my money, I can buy a Royce
Big guns, if I shoot up the whole club that's a lot of noise
You might also like
Blood on my T-shirt
Hearing the screams in reverb
Hitting a play then we skrrt
If she hurt then we hurt
Battle scars getting deeper
Deeper it's getting deeper
Talking really gets cheaper
Tell me how much it's worth
Blood on my T-shirt
Hearing the screams in reverb
Hitting a play then we skrrt
If she hurt then we hurt
Battle scars getting deeper
Deeper, it's getting deeper
Talking really gets cheaper
Tell me how much it's worth

Falling into your eyes
Even though it isn't right
I don't wanna leave tonight, but I don't wanna bleed tonight
Just like every other time, the damage is done
I guess it wasn't enough
'Cause here I am in your arms
While you touch the same scars that you gave to me
You really changed me
When I feel in my heart that you shattered it apart
It's still breaking me, forever endlessly
I'm torn between the love and what it's caused
I've got every reason to hate you
But I'm torn between the love and what it's caused
What it's caused
Uh, I sold you my heart and watched you play with it (Play with it)
I don't want to wait, I'ma hop straight in it (Straight in it)
Speeding in the street car going past the limits
Dodging potholes, thot hoes always in my business
I don't wanna lose my bitch, no, I don't wanna lose her again
Pussy nigga did me dirty, no, I don't wanna be your friend
No matter I'ma stay ten toes in the trenches
I'm gonna keep going 'til a motherfucker finished
Like I'm in it 'til I win it
We ain't the same, I live it
Don't come around when the niggas start winning (Start winning)
Don't come around I be good by myself, bro (Yeah)
I earned my stripes like I walk around in shell toes
Go ahead and play with me
Go and play with my feelings
Rest in peace to Chino, I know that you can hear me
Riding with Dino tryna face some Henny
BackWood on full I ain't tryna ride empty
My shawty wanna fight like she tryna spar with me (Spar with me)
Something on your mind, baby, don't start with me (Start with me)
Many men on your line I'ma give them all fifty (All fifty)
Shots to the head 'cause you know my aim deadly
I'm just tryna live forever, or maybe for the moment
With all the niggas I know
I'm watching some people go
I'm watching some people stay
They praying for me to fall, just let me roll with you
We breaking rules and I know, I know
You gonna spend some money on that pussy, I know
My cars too fast, I ain't tryna catch feelings for you baby
But it's something about you, I know
I don't really wanna wait no more
I don't want you to wait no more
I don't really wanna wait no more
I don't wanna wake up no more
I don't really wanna wait no more
I don't want you to wait no more
I don't really wanna wait no more
I don't wanna wake up no moreEmbed
