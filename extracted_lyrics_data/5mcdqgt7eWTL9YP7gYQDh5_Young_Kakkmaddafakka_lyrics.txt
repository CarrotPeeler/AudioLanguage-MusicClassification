Walk in the mountains, drink in the bar
Steppin back into my own, drop my bags and I look around
Places seem the same, as the memories that remain
I've been away for six months, six months is a long time
When you're stuck with this one dead end desk, with this one stupid cat
And you're wondering, why me?
Walking up to your door, I didn't call so I'm not sure
If you wanna meet people with me, or are you stuck to your TV
Oh, it's been a hundred years, feels like you have left the town
I never see you around, remember you are still young! (so young)
Hey, did you die on your couch? I will always pick up if you call!
You and me can go out, have a ball. Remember you are still young!
Boy, you seem confused, has your wenga been reduced?
Or is it all of this shitty weather? Do you rock enough paper?
Man! Can't you see? I'm still good old me. (Big P)
Yeah, I'm not fake, got the same number as in 98
We can have a walk in the mountains, we can do whatever
We can have a drink in the bar as long as we're together
Oh, it's been a hundred years, feels like you have left the town
I never see you around, remember you are still young! (so young)
Hey, did you die on your couch? I will always pick up if you call!
You and me can go out, have a ball. Remember you are still young!
You might also likeMaybe you are scared, maybe you just ha-ha-had enough
Of people talking bullshit. Had enough! Ohoh!
When did you resign? When did you decide to quit?
When did you decide that nothing really matters anymore?
We can have a walk in the mountains, we can do whatever
We can have a drink in the bar as long as we're together
We can have a walk in the mountains, we can do whatever
We can have a drink in the bar as long as we're together
Oh, it's been a hundred years, feels like you have left the town
I never see you around, remember you are still young! (so young)
Hey, did you die on your couch? I will always pick up if you call!
You and me can go out, have a ball. Remember you are still young! (so young!)
So young!
So young!2Embed
