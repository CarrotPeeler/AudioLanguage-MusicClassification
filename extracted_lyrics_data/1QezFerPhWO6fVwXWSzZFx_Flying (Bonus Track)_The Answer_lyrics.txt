1 ContributorFlying (Bonus Track) LyricsI came down from the hillside
That's when the devil talked to me
I told her I was running outta fight
So if you got some give it to me
She said brother take a shovel
Have a go at digging up that gold in the street
Brother take a shovel
You never know what you find right under your feet
I'm flying
Flying
I'm still but I'm moving
I'm a free ride on the run
I feel like I could never end up losing
Like I'm the only one
So brother take a shovel
Have a go at digging up that gold in the street
Brother take a shovel
No, you nevеr know what you find right under your feet
I'm flying
My feet never touchеd the ground
I'm flying
And the only way is down, down
You might also likeI'm flying
My feet never touched the ground
I'm flying
And the only way is down, down
You never know what's under your feet
We're digging up that gold in the street
Below we got all that we need
We're digging up that gold in the street
Flying
Flying
Flying
Flying
Flying
Never touched the ground
And the only way is downEmbed
