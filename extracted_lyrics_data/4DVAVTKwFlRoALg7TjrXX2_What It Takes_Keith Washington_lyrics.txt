2 ContributorsWhat It Takes LyricsOoh
It’s alright
Yeah

Baby don’t you move
‘Cause I got something good tonight
That I want to give you baby
Leave it up to me

To keep you satisfied
Lady that’s the truth baby
Tonight I swear that I will
Give you what you like
I wanna hear you call my name
Girl you know what I mean

I’m gonna do what it takes
To make you see that I need you
And I can hardly wait
I’m gonna do what I can
To make you feel
All the love in me lady
I’ll give you all you can take

Everything’s so right
Girl come on the night is young
And I’m in the mood for you baby
I’m so into you
Everything you do
Keeps me satisfied
Lady that’s the truth
When I get my hands on you
Girl you can believe
The love that’s been missing lady
You’ll get it all from me

I’m gonna do what it takes
To makе you see that I need you
And I can hardly wait
I’m gonna do what I can
To make you feel
All the love in mе lady
I’ll give you all you can stand
So don’t be afraid
You can rest assure
I’m gonna be right here with you
To the call of love we will answer true
With the lights down low
We will share romance
’Til you start to shake and your heart beats fast
And the sweat rolls down into your face
As I hold you tight the warm embrace
And you lose control and a scream comes on
And you say oh, oh lady, oh

I’m gonna do what it takes
To make you see that I need you lady
And I can hardly wait
I’m gonna do what I can
To make you feel
All the love in me lady
I’ll give you all you can take
So come on
Tell me what you want
Tell me what you need
If you like it like that
Look out
‘Cause I got it right here in my hands
Holding you close sweet romance
Tell me what you want
C’mon
Tell me what you need
Just tell me what you need baby
I got it
Right here lady
Just let me, just let me
Tell me what you want
Tell me what you need
What you need to have done to you
C’mon and let me hold you tight
Let me make sweet love through
Through all the night baby
Tell me what you want
C’mon
Tell me what you need
How yo wanna, how you wanna give it to me
Give it to me, give it to me, give it to meEmbed
