Yeah, yeah, ah yeah

Today's your day, we going out, my baby
You and me, it's a safe location (Yeah)
Let's get away for your birthday
Take a nice little trip somewhere cross the bay
Hit the mall, go get your tips did up
Your nanny got the kids, let's live it up
About a quarter to eight, and I won't be late
The 55 will be parked at the gate, baby

(Make a wish) Close your eyes, blow away, hey
When you're done, girl, give me a kiss

(Make a wish) I'll make all your dreams come true
(Make a wish) Girl there's nothing that I wouldn't do
(Make a wish) Just make a wish
Write out a list, what's broke is fixed
(Make a wish) What's diamonds and pearls
You know you're my girl, I'll give you the world
(Make a wish) I ain't talking 'bout no ifs or maybes
No possibles, girl, you're driving me crazy
(Make a wish)
You might also like
Now open your eyes, I got a surprise, it's in the garage
I copped a CI645
Are you ready to take your first slide?
Cut the ribbon off the whip, put the key in and let's shift
Let's ride from coast to coast
Hit a nice lounge, might as well have a toast, baby
On this special day
We're gonna celebrate my baby's birthday

Girl (Make a wish) Close your eyes, blow away, hey
When you're done, girl, give me a kiss (Yeah)

(Make a wish) I'll make all your dreams come true
(Make a wish) Girl, there's nothing that I wouldn't do
(Make a wish) Just make a wish
Write out a list, what's broke is fixed
(Make a wish) What's diamonds and pearls
You know you're my girl, I'll give you the world
(Make a wish) I ain't talking 'bout no ifs or maybes
No possibles, girl, you're driving me crazy

It's your day
Girl, you're 'bout to have it your way
We can set it off at the spa
Black card, no limit
Anything you want, you can get it
We'll talk, no gimmick
Yeah, I'm committed
Gourmet chefs, fireworks and more
Camcorder gonna catch it all
Make a wish
(Make a wish) I'll make all your dreams come true
(Make a wish) Girl, there's nothing that I wouldn't do
(Make a wish) Just make a wish
Write out a list, what's broke is fixed
(Make a wish) What's diamonds and pearls
You know you're my girl, I'll give you the world
(Make a wish) I ain't talking 'bout no ifs or maybes
No possibles, girl, you're driving me crazy
(Make a wish)

On this special dayEmbed
