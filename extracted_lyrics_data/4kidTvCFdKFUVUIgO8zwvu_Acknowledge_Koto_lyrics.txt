1 ContributorKill Em All! Lyrics
Kill 'em all, kill 'em all
Kill 'em all, kill 'em all
K-K-Kato On The Tack bitch
Kill 'em all, kill 'em all

Quit thinking that they run it
Point 'em out I'm running through they shit
They heard The Beast was coming, grab the Bible's and the crucifix
Big vivid images with words like I drew the pic
The evidence conclusive, evolution when the dude just spits
I'm Tupac resurrected, make moves like a revolutionist
Murder Musick the movement, we recruiting goons and shooting shit
Lunatics, you swimming with the sharks and y'all some tuna fish
My fuse it lit, this anger is a gift so bitch I'm using it (Yo)
Severed them off and if I be talking I back and I'm proving it
You niggas yapping but really ain't doing shit
Never be lacking, I chop when I'm proving of it
I'm running left on your haters, I do this shit
Bitch, I be japping, perhaps I can boo the shit
Acting the fool and make 
Yah, yah, yah, yah
It's 1-8-7 on the competition
I'm making these suckers bite the curb and I stop 'til they stop living
I'll snatch your life with no remorse, it's no different than shoplifting
I've been killing shit like this since I finally got out of prison, yah
Fucking possessed by the devil, no exorcism
Since I sold my soul for money, these rap skills and bitches, yah
I'm not kidding, no options, my ops killing 'em
Fuck your cup of double XL Freshman, I'm not feeling 'em, naw
Cold-blooded savage on these tracks, reptilian
Swear that I ain't stopping 'til I make at least a million
Tell all you suckers in this contest acknowledge I'm brilliant
And Kato On The Track be like "Damn, this nigga's killing shit"
I'm really with that shit, turn stars and stripes like a militant
You 'bout to cross the chief, it's on for life, I call your affiliates
These weak-ass pussy rappers 'bout to find out just how real it gets
All dick in your wife late at night, straight drilling it
Niggas want the beef then bring it to me and I'm grilling it
Never take an L, bounce back, I'm resilient (Yah)
And I ain't never stop until I get my props, diligent
No sucker emcees, squeeze a trigger 'til it's empty
Hitting licks on you suckers, leave you in a black Hefty
I see you niggas hating, jealous ones always envy
They've been sleeping on me but I found the cure for narcolepsy
Didn't wanna have to prove you wrong but this the only choice you left me
Only time you speak my name is when you mentioning who the best be
Talking shit online but see me live and on my testes
Try to shake my hand and dap me up, quit acting like we besties
I swear to God I'll turn you fruity-ass rappers into veggies
I've mastered the Art of War so you really don't wanna test me
A carnivore with this sword as a tongue, y'all looking like fresh meat
Wack and you slur when you be rapping your verse
I'm spectacular with words, that vernacular curse
I live on drinking rapper blood, I got that Dracula thirst (Yeah)
I'm dressed in all black, fresh in your casket in the back of the hearse
I'm walking down the abandoned tracks
I'm ready to snap in all black, I converge
I'm brandishing two battle axes, it's a wack rapper verse
I'm a prodigy mobbing deep on you sleep, slaughter your heard
I'm probably gon' be a problem 'til they put me in the dirt
Rest in peace Big Black, now it's time to do work
You play boy with this beast and you suckers all getting merked, uh
