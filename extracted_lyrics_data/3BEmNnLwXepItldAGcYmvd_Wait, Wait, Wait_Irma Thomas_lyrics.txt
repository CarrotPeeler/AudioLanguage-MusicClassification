Ay, this is a chill ass beat
Ay, when you get that money
How you get that money
How you takin' shit oh
Don't tell me 

Skrrting so fast in my Honda
Stacking that money, lasagna
Texting your thottie, your momma
Sipping them coconuts, smoking that mari-ju-ana
"I don't smoke"
You biting my style like piranha
Placing more commas, wearing pajamas, bitch
Your thottie be looking iguana
Hot boy pretty much sauna, heard that she wanna
Her name is Madonna, pull up on her like I'm JT
Where are them boobies, what
Think I'm a goner, cop myself a couple rubies, so I could go flex on a pawner
Where is my honor? Wait
Where is your daughter? Where are my dollars?
Bands be getting a little stronger, popping my collar
Whipping a Benz, yeah, I'm paid like a doctor

Okay, I got drip all day
Life a trip, okay
Life a brick, okay
Okay, I got drip all day
Life a trip, okay
Life a brick, okay
Okay

Wow
I feel the steeze when I walk
I'm spitting G's when I talk
Smell like febreze on my jock
Wow
Boyo, I do it with ease
I am a thousand degrees
You like a pile of debris
Ow
You can’t hurt these feelings
You can’t feel the ceiling
I'ma spill Darjeeling
Tea
I'm like Bruce Wayne
I'm like Balmain
Know I ball main
Wee

Okay, I got drip all day
Life a trip, okay
Life a brick, okay
Okay, I got drip all day
Life a trip, okay
Life a brick, okay
Blood diamonds gave me hypertension
'Cause I got my ego up, but now I'm flexing
Two-step, but I move slow
'Cause these Gucci slides got fur, bro
Yeah wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait
I'ma move on your money, call that shit checkmate, yah
Sipping the yerb (what)
I ain't smoking the herb, stimulate nerve
I do concur, your lady got curved, that was deserved
Whip, I'm gon' swerve
G, yah
Shades on with the Jays on when I pull up on that booty
Sipping the tea, coochie for free
Flowing so well, I'm the Yangtze

Okay, I got drip all day
Life a trip, okay
Life a brick, okay
Ok, I got drip all day
Life a trip, okay
Life a brick, okayEmbed
