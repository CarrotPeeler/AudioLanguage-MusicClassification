27 ContributorsThe Adventures of Rain Dance Maggie Lyrics
Lipstick junkie, debunk the all in one she
Came back wearing a smile
Looking like someone drugged me that wanted to unplug me
No one in here is on trial, it's just a turn-around

And we go, oh
Well and we go, oh, oh, oh, oh

Tic-toc, I want to rock you like the '80s
Cock-blocking isn’t allowed
Tugboat Shiela is into memorabilia
Who said three is a crowd? We better get it on the go

Hey, now
We’ve got to make it rain somehow
She told me to and showed me what to do
Our Maggie makes it in a cloud

I said hey, now
We’ve got to make it rain somehow
She told me to and showed me what to do
She knows how to make it loud
You might also like
Rain dance Maggie advances to the final
Who knew that she had the goods?
Little did I know her body was warm delicious vinyl
To your neck of the woods, I want to lick a little bit

Hey, now
We’ve got to make it rain somehow
She told me to and showed me what to do
Our Maggie makes it in a cloud

You got the wrong girl
But not for long, girl
It's in the song, girl
'Cause I’ll be gone, girl

Hey, now
We’ve got to make it rain somehow
She told me to and showed me what to do
Our Maggie makes it in a cloud

I said hey, now
I want to rock this rowdy crowd
She told me to and showed me what to do
She knows how to make it loud
But not for long, girl
It's in the song, girl
'Cause I’ll be gone, bye, bye, bye, yeah
Bye bye, bye, girl
Bye bye, girl
Bye bye, girl
Bye bye15Embed
