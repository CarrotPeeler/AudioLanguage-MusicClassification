Honey got a bird, it would sing, baby got a bird
Honey got a bird, it would sing
Without my Corrina, sure don't mean, sure don't mean a natural thing
I learned to love you baby for I call
Honey for I call your name, baby for I call
Honey for I call your name
I wouldn't trade your love for money
Honey you are my warm heart
Baby, you're my warm hearts flame
Have mercy, have mercy, baby you're my hard luck
Mama on my hard luck soul, baby on my hard luck
Honey on my hard luck soul
Got a rainbow round my shoulder
Shine like silver, baby look like Klondike gold
Got a bird what whistle, baby got a bird
Honey got a bird, it would sing, baby got a bird
Honey got a bird, it would sing
Without Corrina, sure don't mean, sure don't mean a natural thing
Corinna, oh Corinna
Corinna, Corrina
Corrina
Corrina
Corinna
Oh Corrina
