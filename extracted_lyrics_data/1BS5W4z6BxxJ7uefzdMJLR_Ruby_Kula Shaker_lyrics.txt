All the leaves are rusty red november
Ruby
Everyday you watch the colors fall fall fall
I see the way you wear your beauty like a crown
Beware of darkness don't let it bring you down
This world is cruel, let me take care of you
My love is like a simple prayer
All that i have left is a simple prayer
Ruby
We could end this lonely night together
Ruby
We could watch the planet spinning round round round
I see the way you wear your beauty like a crown
Beware of maya don't let it bring you down
This world is cruel, let me take care of you
But all i have is a simple prayer
All that i have left is a simple prayer
Oh precious one how do i care
Here in my prison of despair
We're travelling at speed
Waiting to be released
Waiting for you to say you're mine
No more to say, it just turned out this way
My love is like a simple prayer
So don't be sad, the world can send(?)you
My love is like a simple prayer
All that i have left is a simple prayer 2xYou might also likeEmbed
