3 ContributorsBeautiful Loser LyricsOne last kiss before they cart me away
And just take one last look before my body decays
This is my last night on earth
My fucking hell
All my life, all I've wanted to say
This is love, love, love, while the symphony plays
Here in death, I would cut my breath just to stay
I'll never love again
I'll never love again
(Take the vision away)
You're beautiful, beautiful
I'm a loser alive
On a suicide mission to die
You're beautiful, beautiful
I'm a loser inside
Suicide
You're beautiful, yeah
I'm a suicide
Fuck, fuck, fuck, I wanna fuck 'til we bleed
And there's a time crunch, baby, I don't want to believe
This is my last night on earth
My fucking hell
You might also likeI'll never love again
I'll never love again
(Take the vision away)
You're beautiful, beautiful
I'm a loser alive
On a suicide mission to die
You're beautiful, beautiful
I'm a loser inside
Suicide
You're beautiful yeah
I'm a suicide
You're beautiful, beautiful
I'm a loser alive
On a suicide mission to die
You're beautiful, beautiful
I'm a loser inside
Suicide
You're beautiful yeah
I'm a suicide
You're beautiful, beautiful
I'm a loser alive
On a suicide mission to die
You're beautiful, beautiful
I'm a loser inside
Suicide
You're beautiful yeah
I'm a suicide
You're beautiful, beautiful
I'm a loser alive
On a suicide mission to die
You're beautiful, beautiful
I'm a loser inside
Suicide
