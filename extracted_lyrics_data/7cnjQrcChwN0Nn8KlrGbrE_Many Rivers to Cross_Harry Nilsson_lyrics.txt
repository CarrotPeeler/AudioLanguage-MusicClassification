10 ContributorsMany Rivers to Cross Lyrics
Many rivers to cross
But I just can't seem to find my way over
Wandering, I am lost as I travel along
The white cliffs of Dover

Many rivers to cross
And it's only my will that keeps me alive
Well, I've been licked, washed up for years
And I merely survived because of my pride

And this loneliness won't leave me alone
It's such a drag to be on your own
My woman left me and she didn't say why
Well, I guess I'll have to try

Sweet thing
Sweet thing

And this loneliness just won't leave me alone
You know it's such a drag to be on your own
My woman left me but she didn't say why
So I guess I have to try, try
You might also like
Many (many), many (many) rivers to cross
(Many rivers to cross) But just where to begin
I'm praying for time
There have been times I found myself sitting in limbo
Alone, alone, for my lifetime

Many rivers to cross
But I just can't seem to find my way over
Wandering, I am lost as I travel along
The white cliffs of Dover

Yeah, I've got too many rivers to crossEmbed
