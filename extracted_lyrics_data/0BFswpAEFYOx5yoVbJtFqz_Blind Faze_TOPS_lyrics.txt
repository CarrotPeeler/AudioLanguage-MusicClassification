5 ContributorsBlind Faze Lyrics
Shake it off, it's making me crazy
It's wrong, but I'm not telling you why
You don't know what direction you're facing
Forgot the words to your lullaby

Hooked on bad behavior
United by what's making you blind
Now you want somebody to save you
'Cause you know that you've been living a lie

I know that it is getting late
Searching for someone to take
I am not here to hold your hand
Searching for someone who understands

Lies, words that you tell yourself
Don't make it true
Lies, words that you tell yourself
Don't make it true

Take it out on whoever faze you
Always have a reason to fight
Closing in on something amazing
You're caught up, don't have the time
You might also like
Now you want somebody to save you
Hold you and to make it right
To tell you what you want is to stay true
'Cause you know that you've been living a lie

I know that it is getting late
Searching for someone to take
I am not here to hold your hand
Searching for someone who understands

Lies, words that you tell yourself
Don't make it true
Lies, words that you tell yourself
Don't make it true
Lies, words that you tell yourself
Don't make it true
Lies, words that you tell yourself
Don't make it true
