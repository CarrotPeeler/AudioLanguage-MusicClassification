You're looking kinda lonely, girl
Would you like someone new to talk to?
Ah-yeah, alright
I'm feeling kinda lonely too, if you don't mind
Can I sit down here beside you?
Ah-yeah, alright

If I seem to come on too strong
I hope that you will understand
I say these things 'cause I'd like to know
If you're as lonely as I am
And if you'd mind

Sharing the night together, woah, yeah
Sharing the night together, woah, yeah
Sharing the night

We could bring in the morning, girl
If you wanna go that far
And if tomorrow find us together
Right here, the way we are
Would you mind
You might also like
Sharing the night together, woah, yeah
(Would you mind, sharing the night)
(Would you mind)
Sharing the night together, woah, yeah
(Would you mind, sharing the night)
(Would you mind)
Sharing the night

Would you like to dance with me and hold me?
You know I want to be holding you (Uh)
Ah-yeah, alright
'Cause I like feeling like I do
And I see in your eyes that you're liking it, I'm liking it too
Ah-yeah, alright

Like to get to know you better
Is there a place where we can go?
Where we can be alone together
And turn the lights down low
And start

Sharing the night together, woah, yeah
(Would you mind, sharing the night)
(Would you mind)
Sharing the night together, woah, yeah
(Would you mind, sharing the night)
(Would you mind)
Sharing the night together
(Would you mind, sharing the night)
Sharing the night together
(Would you mind, sharing the night)
Sharing the night together
(Would you mind, sharing the night)
Sharing the night together
(Would you mind, sharing the night)2Embed
