That's cool
If you are my friend you can clean my house if you want
Or only if we had a fight. Yeah!
If you are my friend you can sharpen my things with your teeth
That's so sweet
If you are my friend we can raise the Jamaican flag
So we can reggae all night Yeah!
Chorus:
Let's Reggae all night Yeah!
You are so fast! I'm so slow, because...
That's the way I like to roll
If you are my friend you can make dance beats for me
Just for me
If you are my friend you can shake my milk and drink
And i can do the same for you, Yeah!
If you are my friend you can break my back in half
If you are my friend we can raise the Jamaican flag
So we can reggae all night Yeah!
Chorus:
Let's Reggae all night Yeah!
You are so fast! I'm so slow, because...
That's the way I like to roll (x2)
Let's Reggae all night Yeah!

You know this

If you are my friend you can clean my house if you want
