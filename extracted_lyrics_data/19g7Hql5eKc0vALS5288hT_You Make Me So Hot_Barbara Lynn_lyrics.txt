2 ContributorsYou Make Me So Hot Lyrics
You're makin' me so hot
When I'm giving all the love I got
Hoo, you turn me on
Baby, when we're all alone
You know you light my fire, sendin' me higher and higher
Ho, you're my love bone
When all the hope is gone

Ho, you make me so hot
When I'm giving all the love I got
Hoo, you turn me on
Baby, when a-we're all alone
You know you light my fire, sendin' me higher and higher
Ho, you're my love bone
When all the hope is gone

Ho, now there's a her for every sir
And a sister for every mister, yeah
There's a he for every she
Ho, and baby, you're for me

Ho, you're makin' me so hot
When I'm giving all the love I got
Hoo, you turn me on
Baby, when we're all alone
You know you light my fire, sendin' me higher and higher
Ho, you're my love bone
When all the hope is gone
You might also like
Ho, you make me so hot
Ho, baby
You've got me in flames, ah yeah
You got me burnin' up, and I can't get enough
You've got me burnin' up, honey
And I can't get enough
You've got me burnin' up, and I can't get enough
You're makin' me so hot
And I'm giving all the love I got
You're makin' me so hot
When I'm giving all the love I got
Ho, baby
Ah yeah, ah-ah yeahEmbed
