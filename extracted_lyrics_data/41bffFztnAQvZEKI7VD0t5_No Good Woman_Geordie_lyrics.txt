(Keep it Z3N)
We good?

No woman, no cry
No woman, no cry
Said, I remember when we used to sit
In the government yard in Trenchtown

Oba, observing the hypocrites
As they would mingle with the good people we meet
Good friends we have, oh, good friends we've lost
Along the way
In this bright future, you can't forget your past
So dry your tears, I say

No woman, no cry
No woman, no cry
Here, little darling
Don't shed no tears
No woman, no cry
Said, I remember when we used to sit
In the govеrnment yard in Trenchtown
You might also like
And then Gеorgie would make the fire light
If it was logwood burnin' through the night
Then we would cook cornmeal porridge
Of which I'll share with you
My fear is my only courage
And so, I got to push on through
But while I'm gone

Everything's gonna be alright
Everything's gonna be alright
Everything's gonna be alright
Everything's gonna be alright
Everything's gonna be alright
Everything's gonna be alright
Everything's gonna be alright

No woman, no cry
No woman, no cry
No woman, no cry
No woman, no cryEmbed
