1 ContributorAll I Ever Wanted Lyrics
And all I ever wanted
Is to be number one
Be number one 
All I ever wanted
Is to be number one
You're all I ever wanted 

Before the very beginning
I made a plan
I wanted you to see and get to know me
I’d be your man
I endured some hard times
What a heavy price I paid
Doesn't mean it weren't worth it
No mistake was made
I knew my my ?
**
Whatever you need, you know I will provide
You’re all my heart desires

And all I ever wanted
Is to be number one
Be number one 
All I ever wanted
Is to be number one
You're all I ever wanted 
You might also like
Before the very beginning
Before the day light could shine
Before the darkness became the nighttime
You were on my mind
To have you with me
Is all I wanted from the start
Don't turn my love away
Please don't break my heart
I've got a plan to reach you
I would cross the seven seas
I'd pass through any time and space
I have a place for you
A space for only you
No one can take you place, yeah

And all I ever wanted
Is to be number one
Be number one 
All I ever wanted
Is to be number one
You're all I ever wanted 

And all I ever wanted
Is to be number one
Be number one 
All I ever wanted
Is to be number one
You're all I ever wanted 
All I ever wanted in this world
Is for you to be the perfect
Reflection of my life

And all I ever wanted
Is to be number one
Be number one 
All I ever wanted
Is to be number one
You’re all I ever wanted Embed
