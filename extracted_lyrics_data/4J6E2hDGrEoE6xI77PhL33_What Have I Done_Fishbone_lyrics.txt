4 ContributorsVines Lyrics
Look
Seems it ain't gonna take me tonight
Send my love to the lady in white
You can tell em all I'll be back ready next summer
With the same damn pace, just save me a slice
Like
What have I done,  who have I offended
A skinny green bitch, with the pitch black lenses
Frog venom flushed him, inspect the forensics
Sons of the sky to a swarm of detectives
Dry retchings, purge me a river
Sale every beached whale out of your face
You can take a hard left at the burning gorilla
Swing a right at the ice cold mountain of waste
That sly snake and his feline bredrins
Slipped the whole galaxy between my intestines
Shot through a spiral of barbed wire fencing
A garrison of ghouls in the moonlight resting
Who painted a billion versions of my face on the curtains encased in the streaks
And sent that man in a bowler hat swinging through the foals with a blunt blue blade in his teeth
Not sure, sat there dead in the centre
Are you aware that these ships are sinking
Burning sails blanket the water in embers
Whats with them thick green drinks your drinking?
Man, 'llow me a sip
You seen that chick with the legs that stretch off deep in the distance
Infinite fishnet tights on fell feet draped in a fabric of boundless existence
Nah?
Guess you got commitments
Cool
I left a message with the people
Turn my insides out shook em on the ground like come bruv tell me which bits aren't evil
You might also like("You with the hat ... can I have a bit of your drink please? - that's disrespectful, come on man")

I ain't even two cups deep, so we ain't even halfway finished
Watch life bleed through the cracks, in a skyline crawling with wide-eye spirits
And you ain't gonna peel that face off, unless you wanna down that chaser
Rolled up and shot through the night on cannon ball, tell em all I'll be back later

A chief in the check-suit mastered the bitch-slap
You gotta give to the kid he got skill
But he ain't gonna keep a man locked in the corridor licking at the walls all night, nah chill
Besides I been seeing his serpentine sister, running that chirpse like a right creep
Running itchy wrinkles and burst in a slosh fiesta as lesson to stripped down psyche
It's blessed
Did that plump old woman just dropkick death?
Did that mild mannered middle aged chick just pull a pack of wolves from a hole in her toxic flesh?
Must be playing that cosmic chess, you'll never take the queen out
Solid gold drill to the forehead, stand up scrape the weeds out
Offer me a powdered world without limits on a stained glass plate in a house of vagrants
Find every flaw in that well worn brain stem announced on a tannoy in a crowded station
What a washout, drop out, full time cop-out
Spent his time drunk on a life long long-out
A circular slug trail smeared on the pavement
A run down waste man a first round knockout
Who sent this amplified midget? gassing on a milk crate screaming
Twist his minuscule neck, neck another cup
Are you sure that wasn't your tongue speaking?
Bring em all out an immortal mistress in a shifting amorphous mask of our crafting
Swans in spinning them webs of white light unraveling a reel of answers in passing
This is the hand you were dealt, use it to swing out or strangle yourself
Use it to rip away realms of existence or use it to build em candles that melt
Into blackness flickering into midnight madness
You ain't gonna see that road to Damascus
Live amongst humans or live amongst actors, your choice, they got this whole shit backwards
"Yo can you get off your phone, please, please, that paper-mache things one more time mm sketch out" (?)

I ain't even two cups deep, so we ain't even halfway finished
Watch life bleed through the cracks, in a skyline crawling with wide eyed spirits
And you ain't gonna peel that face off, unless you wanna down that chaser
Rolled up and shot through the night on cannon ball, tell em all I'll be back later
I ain't even done with it yet
I ain't halfway finished
A billion and one teeth chew through the sky life bleeds through the cracks in the bite-size minutes
And you ain't gonna peel that face off, sat picking through the raw data
Flung through the night on a cannon ball tear a whole through the sky peace I'll be back laterEmbed
