14 ContributorsOh My Fucking God Lyrics"Well, gentlemen, a great deal of money has been invested in this project and we can't allow it to fail."
Demons
Dream of God
There is no insanity, rather a super sanity
More suited for life after the end of the 20th century
Where everything is art
And everything is trying to express it
Where everything is art
And everything is trying to communicate it
All intelligent beings suffer the dreaming of dreams
And they've all come up to meet me tonight
Although while in the morning, all their wonder and their glory
Has turned ugly and quite simple
Like a venue when you're loading in gear
This night
Is when it all changes
Sexuality, eroticism in asexual persuasions
Man or woman, makes no difference in the outcome
No fashion, no tolerance for stupidity or ignorance
..."Adidas" or "the arch deluxe"...
And time is now an object

Oh, I'm fucking god
And I'll dream all this into becoming real
All I want is my Mommy...
All I want is my Mommy...
All I want is my Mommy...
All I want is my Mommy...
This is the night it all changesEmbed
