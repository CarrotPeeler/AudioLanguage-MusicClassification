1 ContributorJealousy LyricsIt cuts me deep
And it cuts me wide
This gut rock feelin'
I get inside
And I blame you
But it's really me
Can't rid myself
Of jealousy
When I'm away
And you're at home
I don't believe
You're on your own
It's my foolish
Insecurity
Can't rid myself
Of jealousy
Jealousy
As thick as mud
It's in my veins
It's in my blood
Jealousy
It's plain to see
I love you more
Than you love me
You might also likeIt get's me so
I can't sleep at night
I walk the floor
In the pale moonlight
Yes, I blame you
But it's really me
Can't rid myself
Of jealousy
Jealousy
It's thick as mud
It's in my veins
It's in my blood
Jealousy
It's plain to see
I love you more
Than you love me, baby
Jealousy
It's thick as mud
It's in my veins
It's in my blood
Jealousy
It's plain to see
I love you so much
It's killin' me, baby
Jealousy
It's thick as mud
It's in my veins
It's in my blood
Jealously
It's plain to see
I love you more
Than you love me
You'll be the death of me, baby
Jealousy
It's thick as mud
It's in my veins...Embed
