13 ContributorsYa Man Ainâ€™t Me Lyrics
Hey, girl, what's up?
You've been going through it, huh?
Yeah, I know
And I know your man ain't been treating you right
But your man ain't me, listen

Girl, I bet that he be acting all cocky like
Like he deserves you and you so lucky to be with him
Bet he be treating you rude, always got a attitude
Like he's the only dude made for you, woah

But I bet he didn't count on, a little nigga like me coming 'round
Giving you things to think about 'cause I know what's up
Since he ain't tryna step it up, don't you think you should give him up?
'Cause he ain't worth the love

Stop tripping
I know you got a man but, girl, he's slipping
I can see myself getting in where I fit in
I want you to see, just how much your man ain't me 'cause
He ain't fly, he don't even drive
'Cause when you wanna sneak out in the middle of the night, baby, I'm your guy
I might be since he ain't being all that he can be (Yeah)
Baby, please, your man, your man ain't me

Girl, I know that you be wishing he was nothing like
Like that playa type and you so lucky to be with him
Wish that he treated you cool and didn't cheat on you
Like you're just another girl in his crew

But I bet he didn't count on (Oh) a little nigga like me coming 'round
Giving you things to think about 'cause I know what's up, yeah
Since he ain't tryna step it up, don't you think you should give him up?
'Cause he ain't worth your love, you need to stop tripping

Stop tripping (Oh)
I know you got a man but, girl, he's slipping (Oh)
I can see myself getting in where I fit in (I can see myself, yeah)
I want you to see, just how much your man ain't me 'cause (I want you to see)
He ain't fly (He ain't fly), he don't even drive (Oh no)
'Cause when you wanna sneak out in the middle of the night, baby, I'm your guy (Oh)
I might be since he ain't being all that he can be (No)
Baby, please, your man, your man ain't me

Can you see
You and him ain't meant to be together, life with me will be better?
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Yes, just let him leave
You'd be doing yourself a favor
Girl, I'm just tryna save you
Stop tripping (Oh)
I know you got a man but, girl, he's slipping (And you know I can see it)
I can see myself getting in where I fit in (I can fit in, baby)
I want you to see, just how much your man ain't me 'cause (Oh, oh, oh)
He ain't fly (No no), he don't even drive
'Cause when you wanna sneak out in the middle of the night, baby, I'm your guy (In the middle of the night)
I might be since he ain't being all that he can be (I'm your guy, yeah)
Baby, please, your man, your man ain't me

Oh, no, your man ain't me, no, baby (Oh no)
Oh, no, your man ain't me, no, baby (He ain't me, no)
