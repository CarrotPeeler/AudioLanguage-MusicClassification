1 ContributorWaiting For Me LyricsI can't take it no more
I've been down on the floor
Standing on my knees
Where did you go?
I will go my own way
There's no reason to stay
I will find my strength
And smile again
I can feel it
And I can see it
It's not so hard at all to make a change
I can touch it, and I can taste it
I'm moving up again
I'm not losing the race
Cause I'm going to take the chance
There's a life out there waiting for me
I will run for the thrill
And I know I'm gonna win
There's a life out there waiting for me
Waiting for me...
I don't listen to you
And the things that you do
I just go my own way and find the key
Dancing all trough the night
And I feel so right
I wanna go to the edge and be alive
I can feel it
And I can see it
It's not so hard at all to make a change
I can touch it, and I can taste it
I'm moving up again
I'm not losing the race
Cause I'm going to take the chance
There's a life out there waiting for me
I will run for the thrill
And I know I'm gonna win
There's a life out there waiting for me
Waiting for me...
Waiting for you... Waiting for you
Then you called my name
Then you looked in my eyes
Then you told me how much you cared for me
But I know it's too late, I've been loosing my faith
And I said goodbye...
I'm not losing the race
Cause I'm going to take the chance
I will run for the thrill
And I know I'm gonna win
I'm not losing the race
Cause I'm going to take the chance
There's a life out there waiting for me
I will run for the thrill
And I know I'm gonna win
There's a life out there waiting for me
