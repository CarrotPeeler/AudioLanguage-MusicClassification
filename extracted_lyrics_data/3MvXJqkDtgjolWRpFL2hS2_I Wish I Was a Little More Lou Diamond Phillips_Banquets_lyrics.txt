1 ContributorI Wish I Was A Little More Lou Diamond Phillips LyricsSpent our days in the sheets
Smoked our lungs to defeat
My arms are raising
When the only voice I needed was yours
We locked hearts while unsound
Our clothes to the ground
Scattered mornings belong to the lost
You're the only voice that shines to my ears
I've got smoke still stuck in my lungs
When the letdown is wrong
You can't find anymore
Don't look back
When the letdown is wrong
You can't find anymore
Don't look back
Ohh, Ohh
I was a son of a bitch
I fought the feelings for an itch
You can walk to the sound of a better drum
When the grass is greener than what I can give
Cut me, calm me, and rake me, I'm done
Cut me, calm me, and rake me, I'm done
Cut me, calm me, and rake me, I'm done
Walking straight into the sun
Cut me, calm me, and rake me, I'm done
When the letdown is wrong
You can't find anymore
Don't look back
When the letdown is wrong
You can't find anymore
Don't look back
Don't look back
Woah, I won't' bleed if I don't fight
Woah, Just stay, stay the night
'Cause there's diamonds in this, I've got plenty to give
Every song was our song, and I can sing them in key
I can sing them in key
Ohh, Ohh, Ohh, Ohh
When the letdown is wrong
You can't find anymore
Don't look backYou might also likeEmbed
