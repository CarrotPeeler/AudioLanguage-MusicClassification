Paint a yuletide valentine
Back home I go to those I know
For a Christmas auld lang syne
And as we gather 'round the tree
Our voices all combine
In sweet accord to thank our Lord
For a Christmas auld lang syne
When sleigh bells ring and choirs sing
And the children's faces shine
With each new toy we share their joy
With a Christmas auld lang syne
We sing his praise this day of days
And pray next year this time
We'll all be near to share the cheer
Of a Christmas auld lang syne
In sweet accord to thank our Lord
For a Christmas auld lang syneYou might also likeEmbed
