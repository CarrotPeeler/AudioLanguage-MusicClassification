I'm walking to the something
Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah
(Collapse)
I'm drinking too much blah blah
Blah blah blah blah blah blah
(Fall out)
I'm feeling really blah blah, I want to blah blah blah
(Collapse)
And in the end it means I blah blah blah blah blah blah blah (Depend)
I brought myself together
Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah
(Watch out)
I didn't need the patience, life blah blah blah blah blah
(Collapse)
Don't you get too close or I'll blah blah blah blah blah
(Break up)
Stick it up your nose, blah blah blah blah blah blah blah
The end

I didn't mean to do it, it loved me in my head
I tried to be a charmer, I got a bit hopeless instead
The world is very sexy, it's part of my collapse

I'm walking to the something
Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah
I'm drinking too much blah blah
Blah blah blah blah blah blah
(Fall out)
I'm feeling really blah blah, I want to blah blah blah
(Collapse)
And in the end it means I blah blah blah blah blah blah blah
(The end)

I tried to be a charmer, I got a bit hopeless instead
The world is very sexy, it's part of my collapse

I'm walking to the something
Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah
I'm drinking too much blah blah
Blah blah blah blah blah blah
Fall out
I'm feeling really blah blah, I want to blah blah blah
Collapse
And in the end it means I blah blah blah blah blah blah blah
