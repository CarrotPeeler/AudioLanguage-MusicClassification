2 ContributorsSummer In Berlin Lyrics
This day's an invitation and it's just for you
You've got a reservation for the 17th of June
Open your eyes and let the sun break in for a while
There may be something that you've never seen inside

Feel how your heart beats like a heavy machine
The sound of the traffic is like a silent dream
The dust in the park, the exhaust from the cars
Ascends in that heated afternoon, you touch a sweaty body

Summer in Berlin, it's alright (It's alright)
The day feels so tired
From the lead in the air and the fire in the skies
Life seemed to be a fault of grace
But it's okay, it gave you a kiss
In the middle of the crossroads

Feel how your heart beats like a heavy machine
The sound of the traffic is like a silent dream
The dust in the park, the exhaust from the cars
Ascends in that heated afternoon, you touch a sweaty body
You might also like
Summer in Berlin, it's alright (It's alright, it's alright)
The day feels so tired
From the lead in the air and the fire in the skies
Life seemed to be a fault of grace
But it's okay, it gave you a kiss
In the middle of the crossroads

Summer in Berlin, summer in Berlin
Oh, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright
The heat of the sun
Which is stored in the pavement feels so fine
Here stands the innocent
And there it comes, oh, so wild
That's when you're longing
For a summer by the wall (Summer in Berlin)

Summer in Berlin
It's a summer in Berlin
Here stands the innocent
And there it comes, oh, so wild
That's when you're longing
For a summer by the wall (It's summer by the wall)Embed
