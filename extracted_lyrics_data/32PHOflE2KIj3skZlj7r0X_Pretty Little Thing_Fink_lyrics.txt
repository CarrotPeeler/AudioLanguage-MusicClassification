5 ContributorsPretty Little Thing Lyrics
When she leaves, she's just asking to be followed
When she walks out, all she wants is to be lead
All my boys say she's just asking for it
And I ain't saying nothing

She couldn't care less (oh oh)
Wearing that dress (I tell her)

Pretty little thing (oh no)
Hot little thing
Hot little thing and knows it
Don't suppose it would be cool if we hung out?

'Cos when u walked by, you know every guy noticed
The way that your dress clings on for the ride (mm mm)
All my boys say she's the type to fake it
And I ain't saying nothing

She couldn't care less (oh oh)
Wearing that dress (I tell her)
See Fink LiveGet tickets as low as $34You might also like
Pretty little thing (oh no)
Hot little thing
Hot little thing and knows it
Don't suppose it would be cool if we hung out?

We could go out
We could go anywhere that you want
We could stay in
We could do anything that you want
We could do lunch in Soho
Or something

Â´Cos when you walked in all I want is the reason
To talk to the girl whose grace is so rare
All my boys say you won't get her numbers
And I ain't saying nothing

Pretty little thing (oh no)
Hot little thing
Hot little thing who knows it
Don't suppose it would be cool if we hung out?Embed
