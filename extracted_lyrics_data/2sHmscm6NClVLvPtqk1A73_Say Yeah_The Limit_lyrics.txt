1 ContributorSay Yeah Lyrics
Baby, looking at you, it takes me back in time
Lately, I've been dreaming, you've been on my mind
I can still see, you beside me
You ask me, "Do I love you?" I couldn't help it if I try
Love was so unfair, we had to roll against the time

Partners in crime, way down the line

So many memories, how sweet love can be
I do, I do, really love you

I wanna hear you say yeah
Say yeah
Say that you love me, say that you care
Say that we'll always have a love to share
Say yeah
Say yeah

Baby, I'm for real, tell me do you feel like I do?
Nothing can conceal, all my love is waiting for you
You might also like
Baby this time, tell me your mine

I wanna hear you say yeah
Say yeah
Say that you love me, say that you care
Say that we'll always have a love to share
Say yeah
Say yeah

So many memories, ah

I wanna hear you say yeah
Say yeah
Say that you love me, say that you care
Say that we'll always have a love to share
Say yeah
Say yeah

So many memories, how sweet love can be
I do, I do, really love you
I wanna hear you say yeah
Say yeah
Say that you love me, say that you care
Say that we'll always have a love to share
I wanna hear you say yeah
Say yeahEmbed
