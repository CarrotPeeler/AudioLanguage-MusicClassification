1 ContributorEverytime (Nalin & Kane mix) LyricsCan you hear me
Talking in my mind
I can feel you
You're with me all the time
Everytime I close my eyes
I see your face
Everytime I close my eyes
I see your face
There's a warm sky
Covering the night
In the darkness
I only feel the light
Everytime I close my eyes
I see your face
Everytime I close my eyes
I see your face
Everytime I close my eyes
I see your face
When I'm lonely
Your voice is in my head
And my memory feeds my soul
With all the things you've said
You might also likeEverytime I close my eyes
I see your face
Everytime I close my eyes
I see your face
Everytime I close my eyes
I see your faceEmbed
