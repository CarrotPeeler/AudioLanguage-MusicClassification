One won't stop the flow
Console your child, get him ready
One more don't let go
Tonight
It's you
Calm your eyes, get 'em ready
One won't stop the flow
(soul coming around, in morning sun)
C'mon c'mon soul of mine, you're ready
One more don't let go
(soul coming around, the mourn tonight)
Tonight, it's soda water
Soda water, soda water boys
Soda water so
Ahh, soul of mine
Ahh, sober
Ahh, sold the mind
Ahh I'm so sober
I know the way
Ahh, stoned
Ahh, so it ends
Ahh oh stone sober

Gimme that acid!
And I wanna lose everything that's policing us, and then everything must begin!
And I wanna do heroin!
And I wanna do crack cocaine!
And I wanna lose everything but release, why don't you just
Smoke that fucking weed boy, drink the wine
Weed boy, drink the wine
Weed boy, drink the wine
Bring the pain!
(All of it's all we are, that's all we are)
Bring the pain!
Weed boy, drink the wine
Weed boy, drink the wine
Bring the pain!
Weed boy, drink the wine
Weed boy, drink the wine
Face yourself!
Send me to hell!Embed
