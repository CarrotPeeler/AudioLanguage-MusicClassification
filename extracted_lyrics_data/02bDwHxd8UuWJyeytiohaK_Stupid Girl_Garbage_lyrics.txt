22 ContributorsStupid Girl Lyrics
You pretend you're high
Pretend you're bored
Pretend you're anything
Just to be adored
And what you need
Is what you get
Don't believe in fear
Don't believe in faith
Don't believe in anything
That you can't break

You stupid girl (Ah)
You stupid girl (Ah)
All you had, you wasted (Ah)
All you had, you wasted (Ah)

What drives you on (Drives you on)
Can drive you mad (Drive you mad)
A million lies to sell yourself
Is all you ever had
See Garbage LiveGet tickets as low as $76You might also like
Don't believe in love
Don't believe in hate
Don't believe in anything
That you can't waste

You stupid girl (Ah)
You stupid girl (Ah)
Can't believe you fake it (Ah)
Can't believe you fake it (Ah)

Don't believe in fear
Don't believe in pain
Don't believe in anyone
That you can't tame

You stupid girl (Ah)
You stupid girl (Ah)
All you had, you wasted (Ah)
All you had, you wasted (Ah)
You stupid girl (Ah)
You stupid girl (Ah)
I can't believe you fake it (Ah)
I can't believe you fake it (Ah)
You stupid girl (Ah)
You stupid girl (Ah)
Can't believe you fake it (Ah)
Can't believe you fake it (Ah)
