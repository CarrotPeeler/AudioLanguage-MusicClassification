5 ContributorsBlack And White Lyrics
Stick to your guns
Diamonds are a girl's best friend
Nobody knows the trouble this poor boy's seen
People will believe anything
Man on the run
Always gets it in the end
Nobody cares 'cause nobody shares his dream
People don't believe anything

Everything is changed
Everything is still the same
It's just a part of the game

Blood on the moon
Patterns running across the floor
A musical inside a movie inside a dream
Guess you can believe anything

Everything is changed
Everything is still the same
It's all a part of the game
You might also like
Mama, papa, boys and girls
Holding hands around the world
Wrong is wrong and right is right
Nothing changes overnight
I'll believe it when I see it in black and white
I'll believe it when I see it in black and white

Tell me the truth
Nobody leaves here alive
In the black hole of doubt
Trying to get out in the light
Sometimes you can't see anything

Everyone is changed
Everyone is still the same
They can't get out of the game


I'll believe it when I see it in black and white, yeah
I'll believe it when I see it in black and white, black and white
I'll believe it when I see it in black and white, black and white
I'll believe it when I see it in black and whiteEmbed
