2 ContributorsFeels So Good #2 LyricsOoh-wee! Girl, you know I love you
Yes, I love you when you throw your love
Your lovin' arms all around me, girl
You make me feel good, now
Girl, I feel good, feel good
Well, I feel like shoutin' somethin'
I feel good
Ooh-wee! You know I love you, baby
Yes, I love you
When you throw your lovin'
Lovin' arms all around me, girl
You kiss me, you hold me
You make me feel good, now
Girl, I feel good, feel good
Well, I feel like shoutin'
Ooh-wee! I know she's got it, boy
The girl's got it, I know she's got it
She's got somethin', now, boy
That makes me feel good, now
Girl, I feel good, feel good
Well, I feel like shoutin' somethin'
I feel so goodYou might also likeEmbed
