1 ContributorAll New (Heart Shut Tight) LyricsI dreamed this dream
That's not how I ought to start a song, but tag along
Sometimes the tried clich√©s are true
And there were you, all mysterious and smooth
Wrapped in riddles, worth a little scar or two
So I opened up
Might not be new for most of you, but listen up
Some of us are more repressed than others
And we try, experiment from time to time
I thought I'd dream of being dreamed of
Thought I'd pine -- for a time
But I woke up in New Mexico, running with my palms wide open
And my heart shut tight, my heart shut tight
I woke up over Joshua Tree, stars all poking fun of me
And my heart shut tight, my heart shut tight -- my heart she tried
I wanna make my home in these poor bones
And shake the New York lonely off of me
Never you mind
You are the ditch I tumbled into running blind
Dropped my caution, stopped my watching, and for what?
I slept right through the truth of us
So don't you fret, you bear no fault, I just slipped up -- just tripped up
And it's hell to pay
I'm bound for Concord and I'm conquered, I'm betrayed
I'll point my bleeding nose back north where I belong
Rocky Mountains, point me home
I really hate my coming late by what you knew all along --
It's in every damn love song --
Your rocks are colder
Your coast is older
But the names are all all new all new all new
And I woke up under turning trees, Jersey raining leaves on me
And my heart shut tight against the Orleans night
I woke up on Montana roads, bleeding hard and dogged by hope
And my heart shut tight, my heart shut tight
Oh, my heart she tried so hard to do like humans do
To fall a little fall, to dream a dream or two
I'll fly back across the plains again and perch a humbled spell
And come back for the Maritimes when I have learned my lessons well
You guard your own -- you stay awake
The house makes the rules -- the house wins the game
I woke up in New Mexico, running with my palms wide open
And my heart shut tight, my heart shut tight
I woke up under Joshua Tree, 29 Palms mocking me
And my heart shut tight, my heart shut tight
I woke up in New Mexico, I knew exactly how we'd go
And my heart shut tight, my heart shut tight
I woke up over Joshua Tree, stars all poking fun of me
And my heart shut tight, my heart shut tight, my heart she tried
I wanna make my home in these poor bones
And shake the New York lonely off of meYou might also likeEmbed
