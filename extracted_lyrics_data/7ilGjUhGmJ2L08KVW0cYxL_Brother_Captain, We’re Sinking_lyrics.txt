3 ContributorsBrother Lyrics
My brother made sure I didn't die
It could have happened one hundred times
And we both escaped that place
Where you're only known for past mistakes
Well, I'll sit back and dream about sleep again
Well, I'll sit back and dream about sleep again

Throwing up behind the AVI
I saw this guy with bloodshot eyes
The nights when you feel the most alive
The nights when you're not scared to die
Well, I'll sit back and dream about sleep again
Well, I'll sit back and dream about sleep again

Things just have to change
My brother, are you okay?
Things just have to change
My brother, are you okay?

Well, it felt like you all left me
That's when I started drinking steadily
And now I'm crippled with anxiety
That's why I started drinking heavily
But I'll sit back and dream about sleep again
Well, I'll sit back and dream about sleep again
You might also like
Things just have to change
My brother, are you okay?
Things just have to change
My brother, are you okay?
(Well are you okay?)

Things just have to change
My brother, are you okay?
(Well are you okay?)
Things just have to change
My brother, are you okay?Embed
