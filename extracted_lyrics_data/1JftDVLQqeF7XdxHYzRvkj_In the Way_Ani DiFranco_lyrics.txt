1 ContributorIn The Way LyricsNo you didn't just leave
I actually kicked you out
I couldn't hardly believe
That the words came out my mouth
You couldn't hardly believe
What you heard yourself discuss
As you packed up all your things
And you said goodbye to us
Tell me, what is in the way
In the way of my love for you?
There's somethin in the way
In the way of my love
So now there's nothing left to lose
And the screen just says fini
Each night in separate rooms
We cry separately
And every day we yell
Down each other's holes
Two slippery strippers
Swinging round two poles
Tell me, what is in the way
In the way of my love for you?
What is in the way
In the way of my love
I gotta get it out the way
Out the way of my love for you
There's something in the way
In the way of my love

Then we took down all the walls
Packed up our expectations
Piled em up in the hall
We bagged our future
And kicked it to the curb
Then we stood there unencumbered
And we stood there undeterred
Cuz we were done clinging
To the things
We were afraid to lose
And the only thing left
Was a breathtaking view
And you looked at me
And i looked at you
And you said
How bout now, baby
Now what you wanna do?
Now there's nothing in the way
In the way of my love for you
No, there's nothing in the way
In the way of my love
I had to get it out the way
Out the way of my love for you
There was something in the way
In the way of my love
No you didn't just leaveEmbed
