2 ContributorsWrote A Song For Everyone LyricsMet myself a comin' county welfare line
I was feelin' strung out, hung out on the line
Saw myself a goin', down to war in June
What I want, all I want is writin' myself a tune
Wrote a song for everyone
Wrote a song for truth
Wrote a song for everyone
And I couldn't leave it up to you
Got myself arrested, wound me up in jail
Richmond 'bout to blow up, communication failed
If you see the answer, now's the time to say
What I want, all I want is get you down to pray
I wrote a song for everyone
Wrote a song for truth
Wrote a song for everyone
And I couldn't even talk to you
I wrote a song for everyone
Wrote a song for truth
Wrote a song for everyone
And I couldn't even talk to you
Saw the people a standin' thousand years in chains
Somebody said it's different now, look, it's just the same
Pharaohs spins the message, 'round and 'round the truth
They could have saved a million people, how can I tell you?
