3 ContributorsSo Tell The Girls That I Am Back In Town LyricsI've been on the road
I've been on vacation
I've been travelling light to reach my final destination
Now I'm coming home
So tell the girls that I am back in town
You'd better tell them to beware
Well they may go or they might try to hide
I follow on and I'll be there
So tell the girls that I am back in town
And if it's true I do not know
That every girl around had missed me since
I decided to go
I could be your friend
I could be your stranger
I could be the one your mother said would be a danger
