My mood is grey
I would exchange
Some sunny days
I lost the smile
Lost the knack
Lost my mind
Read my book
Sin paid again
Lost my concentration then
Lost the plot
Lost the track
Lost my mind
Won't come back
Won't be back
It's raining
My mood is grey
I would exchange
Some sunny daysYou might also likeEmbed
