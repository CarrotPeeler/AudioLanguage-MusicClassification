A moth into a butterfly
And a lie into the sweetest truth
I'm so afraid of life
I try to call your name, but
I'm silenced by the fear of dying
In your heart once again

I see the seasons changing
And in the heart of this autumn, I fall
With the leaves from the trees

I play dead
To hide my heart
Until the world, gone dark, fades away

I cry like God cries the rain
And I'm just one step away
From the end of today

I see the reasons changing
And in the warmth of the past, I crawl
Scorched by the shame
You might also like
I play dead
To hide my heart
Until the world, gone dark, fades away
I stay dead
Until you veil my scars
And say goodbye to fate
Before it's too late
Before it's too late


I play dead
To hide my heart
Until the world, gone dark, fades away
I stay dead
Until you veil my scars
And say goodbye to fate
I play dead
To hide my heart
Until the world, gone dark, fades away
Before it's too lateEmbed
