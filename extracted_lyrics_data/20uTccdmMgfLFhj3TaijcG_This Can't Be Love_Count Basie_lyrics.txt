Told 'em meet me at the top (top)
I won't ever stop (stop)
They can't crop me out
They can't count me out
They got real mad
Bitch, I'm in my bag
Pulling out that swag, they ain't even know I had
These Maison Margiela, not no rags (they not no rags)
They might get a laugh, I get last laugh (I get last laugh)
Way I'm cooking up the swag, they think I'm in lab (I'm in lab)

I can't live in Paris (nah), I'm moving too fast
I had to move out, after 
Why they keep reusing all this swag that I been had (too much swag)
Go and be yourself, please take off the mask
How you stare in the mirror? You know that's not you
I cannot be fake, that can't make me comfortable
Ain't nothing fakе about me, from my head to shoes
I pullеd out some TRUEs, now everybody back to wearing TRUEs
Keep it together, baby, Like you some glue
They see me and they say: Damn! He a mood
Got a different swag, for every mood
I got a different bag, for all the loot
I was 19 years old, and I saw the Loon
And I'm from Chicago, yeah you ain't knew
And I get this money, I love the blues
My Uncle was in Count Basie, I love the blues
Google Sonny Cohn, I'm telling the truth
He taught me how to play the trumpet, I'm telling the truth
Let me in the door, boy, you gotta move
RIP to J Wrld, he chipped my tooth
Turn down every deal, on the truth
Kanye tried to sign me, he knows who
Everything I'm saying is the truth
This shit crazy, I know you knew

Told 'em meet me at the top (yeah)
I won't ever stop (yeah)
They can't crop me out (yeah)
They can't count me out (yeah, yeah)
They got real mad (yeah)
Bitch, I'm in my bag (yeah, yeah)
Pulling out that swag, they ain't even know I had (yeah, yeah)
These Maison Margiela, not no rags (yeah, yeah)
They might get a laugh, I get last laugh (yeah, yeah)
Way I'm cooking up the swag, they think I'm in lab (yeah, yeah)

Told 'em meet me at the top
