2 ContributorsTowards The Hall Of Bronzen Shields LyricsThe... sun areose beyond the mighty hill The
Inlet ruled, by silence laid, so chill The...
... shadows grew as the sun rode high That
Day for countless people came to die "...
And... high above the one-eyed God sat on his throne To
Gaze upon the whole lands of Midgaard He
The, Allfather who, already knows the end of every day Sent
His shieldmaiden on winged horses To
Lead all those to Walhall who are the chosen ones to die "... The
... dragonships set sail and farewell drew near The
Thunderings of Thorr's hammer were to hear The...
... elder ones by whom the runes were thrown Saw
All those things through which their fate was shown A...
... gentle breeze brought the bloody scent As
Spears without a number were upwards tend Two...
... black ravens known as Odhinn's eyes Circled
High to descend from the skies And...
... Valkyrjur rode at heavens high To
Await the death of those who had to die And...
You might also like... to lead them well on their final way Towards
The hall of bronzen shields that dayEmbed
