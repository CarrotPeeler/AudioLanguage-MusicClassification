10 ContributorsYour Flesh Is So Nice Lyrics
I want to tell you a story
About a little cutey
She's ass-slappin' pretty
And voluptuous fingers
Wanna let her lick me
Stick the thick of my pussy
From across the street
She looked good enough to eat... me!
Kitty!

Your flesh is nice
Your flesh is nice
Let me take a bite
Your flesh is so nice

Oh, I take off my belt
Oh, I whip the staircase (whip the staircase)
Oh, kill all the men
Everything's dead to them
You're the only one I follow
C'mon and lemme give you that "o"
You might also like
Your flesh is nice (your flesh is so)
I wanna take you twice
Your flesh is nice
Ooh your flesh is nice
Your flesh is nice
Wanna take a bite
Your flesh is so

Your flesh is so
Your flesh is so
Your flesh is so (uhh)
Your flesh is so
Your flesh is so
Your flesh is so
Your flesh is so
Your flesh is so
Your flesh is so
Your flesh is so
Your flesh is so
Your flesh is so
Your flesh is so nice
Your flesh is so nice
Your flesh is so nice
Your flesh is so nice
Your flesh is so nice
Your flesh is so nice
Your flesh is so nice
Your flesh is so nice
Your flesh is so nice
Your flesh is so
Your flesh is so
Your flesh is so
(nice)
Your flesh is so
Your flesh is so (nice)
Your flesh is so
Your flesh is so (nice)
Your flesh is so (nice)
Your flesh is so (nice)
Your flesh is so (nice)Embed
