14 ContributorsI Ainâ€™t No Nice Guy Lyrics
When I was young
I was the nicest guy I knew
I thought I was the chosen one
But time went by
And I found out a thing or two
My shine wore off as time wore on

I thought that I was living
Out the perfect life
But in the lonely hours
When the truth begins to bite
I thought about the times
When I turned my back and stalled
I ain't no nice guy after all

When I was young
I was the nicest guy in town
I thought I had it down for sure
But time went by
And I was lost in what I found
The reasons blurred, the way unsure

I thought that I was living
Life the only way
But I saw that life was
More than day to day
I turned around
I read the writing on the wall
I ain't no nice guy after all
I ain't no nice guy after all
You might also like
In all the years you spent
Between your birth and death
You find there's lots of times
When you should have saved your breath
It comes as quite a shock
When that trip leads to the fall
I ain't no nice guy after all
I ain't no nice guy after all


When I was young
I was the nicest guy I knew
I thought I was the chosen one
But time went by and
I found out a thing or two
My shine wore off as time wore on

I thought that I was living
Out the perfect life
But in the lonely hours
When the moon's the only light
I thought about the times
I turned my back and stalled
I ain't no nice guy after all
I ain't no nice guy after all4Embed
