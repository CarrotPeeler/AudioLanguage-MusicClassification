1 ContributorShould I run away? Lyrics
Knew it from the start, you were all I wanted
A light in in the dark, a fire that I started
You broke me apart like your empty hearted

But should I run away and come back another day?
I won't turn the other way but you are and your probably fucking him

And you weren't in love with me, you were in love with him
Got so many scars can't heal cause’ you’re up with him
We could've gone to shows together but you made me hate my life here
So ima’ run away, run away, run away, run away

This love is like a game
Be my Juliet and share my pain
We were dancing, dancing in the rain
Now your fucking gone, my life is grey
And I won't ever be the same
All the late night calls and Hennasy
Girl this is poison in my veins
I'm you Romeo my heart you'll take, love
 (OHMYGODPIXEL & Lil Liar)
But should I run away and come back another day?
I won't turn the other way but you are and your probably fucking him
You might also like (OHMYGODPIXEL & Lil Liar)
And you weren't in love with me, you were in love with him
Got so many scars can't heal cause’ you’re up with him
We could've gone to shows together but you made me hate my life here
So ima’ run away, run away, run away, run awayEmbed
