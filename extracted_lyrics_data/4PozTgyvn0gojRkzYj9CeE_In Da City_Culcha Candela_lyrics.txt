In da city
Where the party always gonna rock on
(Inna sunshiny weather
Where people come together)
Berlin city
Love you, but sometimes I got to move on
(Sometimes I got to come down
From da trouble, from da noise and from da sound)

Yo, in da Berlin city woman and man dem irie
But me overstand well how somebody flee flee
When me sit by di riverside feeling free
When me chat about situation with me brother
A'Still me living inna concrete jungle
Big up unu sound but a fire fi di symbol
Me haffi escape all di dust and rumble
Inna di countryside me a go njam well (Yeah, yeah)
Me yearn for a juicy - yearning for a powerfull and mighty bushtree
Dreaming about walkin inna di country
Watching all dem animals around there dem a live free
Down inna di real jungle with no concrete
Man a plant seed or dem belly stay empty
But its ya berlin city...and we're puffing berlin weed

In da city
Where the party always gonna rock on
(Inna sunshiny weather
Where people come together)
Berlin city
Love you, but sometimes I got to move on
(Sometimes I got to come down
From da trouble, from da noise and from da sound)

This is the time we've been waiting for
It's the S-U-double-M-E-R for sure now
Sneak-sneak to the left, take a peak to the right (Yes)
Look at the ladies, oh what a sight, yo
An alle, die es spürn
Ihr dürft bloß keine Zeit verliern, yo
Checkt den park, feiert hart
Erhaltet eure Art — Larsito wünscht gute Fahrt

I see me sitting reminiscing about last summer
Wondering how the time has walked away
Everybody was around everybody felt free
And I wonder why now I am feeling so lonely on sunshiny day
Everyone I got the chance so I break free
Watch yo child runnin down da street dem I play 
Take away de pressure da society
And bring a little love to da city
In da city (In da city)
Where the party always gonna rock on
(Rock on, rock on, rock on)
(Inna sunshiny weather
Where people come together)
Berlin city (Berlin city)
Love you, but sometimes I got to move on
(Move on, move on, move on)
(Sometimes I got to come down
From da trouble, from da noise and from da sound)

We're talking about di summertime – Hey...
Was los in den Clubs, was los in den Bars
Where everybody have a good time – Ho...
Was los auf den Straßen, was los in den Parks
The sweet sweet summertime – Hey...
Was los im Norden, was los im Süden
Where all the people dem a feel fine – Ho...

In da city (In da city)

Love you, but sometimes I got to move on
