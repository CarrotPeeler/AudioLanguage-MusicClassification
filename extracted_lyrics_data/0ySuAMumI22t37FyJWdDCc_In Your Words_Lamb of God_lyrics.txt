7 ContributorsIn Your Words Lyrics
A sacred cash cow with sickly tits
Dripping temptation for hypocrites
To death she's beaten, the prosperous
Endlessly stating the obvious

Caught in your words, sever the knot this time
Somebody show me their true

Face me once as I leave all that I despise
Face me as I unleash this hate refined

Indict the blameless, transparent designs
Pathetic and shameless, crucified
A legend in his own mind, enthroned by lies
A cheap Machiavelli plots his demise

Caught in your words, sever the knot this time
Somebody show me their true

Face me once as I leave all that I despise
Face me as I unleash this hate refined
Face me as I leave all this far behind
Face me as I unleash this hate refined

What once gave life
Now infested with plague
The lamb lies with maggots
Blinded, gagged, betrayed
What once gave life
Now infested with plague
The lamb lies with maggots
The corpse bloated with rage

Face these eyes
Hate refinedEmbed
