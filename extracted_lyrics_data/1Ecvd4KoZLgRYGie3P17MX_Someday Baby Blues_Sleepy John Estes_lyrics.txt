I don't care how long you’re gone, I don't care how long you stay
But that good kind treatment, bring you back home someday
Someday, baby, you ain't gonna worry my mind anymore

I have that wind, that old chilly breeze
Come blowin’ through your BVDs, but
Someday, baby, you ain't gonna worry my mind anymore

If you don't quit bettin', boys, them dice won't pass
It's gon' send you home on your yas yas yas, but
Someday, baby, you ain't gonna worry my life anymore

It ain’t but the one thing that give a man the blues
He ain’t got no bottom in his last pair of shoes, but
Someday, baby, you ain't gonna worry my mind anymore

I tell all the people in your neighborhood
You’s a no-good woman, you don't mean no good, but
Someday, baby, you ain't gonna worry poor John's mind anymoreYou might also likeEmbed
