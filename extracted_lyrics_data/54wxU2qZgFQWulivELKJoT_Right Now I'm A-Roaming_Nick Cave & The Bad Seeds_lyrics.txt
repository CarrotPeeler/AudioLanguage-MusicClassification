7 ContributorsRight Now Iâ€™m A-Roaming Lyrics
When I get home, I'm gunna clean up my house
When I get home, I'm gunna kick out that mouse
When I get home, I'm gunna put things in order
But right now, right right now, right now I'm a-roaming

When I get home, I'm gunna make that call
When I get home, I'm gunna talk it through
When I get home, I'm gunna straighten it out
But right now, right now, right now I'm a-roaming

When I get home, I'm gunna give up the booze
When I get home, I'm gunna eat me some food
When I get home, I'm gunna quit them drugs
But right now, right now, right now I'm a-roaming

When I get home, I'm gunna call my mother
When I get home, I'm gunna cook her some dinner
When I get home, I'm gunna invite my brothers
But right now, right right now, right now I'm a-roaming

When I get home, I'm gunna see my little boy
When I get home, I'm buy him a little toy
When I get home, he's gunna jump for joy
But right now, right right now, right now I'm a-roaming

When I get home, I'm gunna unpack my bags
When I get home, I'm gunna waash these dirty rags
When I get home, I'm gunna pack 'em up again
But I'm gunna go, I'm gunna go, I'm gunna go right back roamingEmbed
