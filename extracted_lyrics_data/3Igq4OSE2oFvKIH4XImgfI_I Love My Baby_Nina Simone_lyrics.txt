I love my baby
I've loved him so long
I love my baby
I've loved him since he was born
Now, sweet baby is gone
And done me, oh, so wrong

I love you, baby, tell the whole wide world I do, Lord
If my crying time tell the whole wide world I do, Lord

Come on back, baby
Now I understand
Come on back, baby
Why you're doing me in red
Come back and hold me
And take me by my hand

Come back, baby, and take me by the hand
Don't you know I love you, baby, don't you understand, oh?

Just say you love me
And we'll go to the preacher man
Just say you love me
And before him we'll stand
We'll live our lives together
As we go hand in hand
You might also like
You say you love me, we'll go to the preacher man
Don't you know I love you, baby, let my crying tell

And we'll live our lives together
As we go hand in handEmbed
