Try a little tenderness
You know, yes, you know she's waiting
Just anticipating
The things she may never possess
What's she without them
Try try a little tenderness
Oh it's not just sentimental
She has her greave's and cares
And the word sweet and gentle
Makes it easier makes it easier to bear
You won't regret it
We may not forget it
Love, love, love is their whole happiness
It's oh so easy it's oh so easy
