4 ContributorsConfession LyricsBy now you should mind your mouth
By now you should call me, we can work it out
By now you should be in a better place
And thinking for yourself, it's not your ax to grind
I fallow it until the end of my concession
A falling out I heard from them, there's no discretion
I'm burning out on this and this is my latest confession
I hope you hear about it
Victim, I know the saints come to call
And bring you obsession to save you from your fall
Victim, I know it won't be long
'Till one worth possessing is one you'll never reach
Swallow it until the end of our concession
I'm sure I'll hear from you through them, there's no discretion
I'm burning out on this and this is my latest confession
I doubt you'll hear about it
I fallow it until the end of my concession
A falling out I heard from them, there is no discretion
It's only indecision, this is your latest condition
I hope you hear about it soonYou might also likeEmbed
