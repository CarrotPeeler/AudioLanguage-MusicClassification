4 ContributorsMan Full of Yesterdays LyricsHe wanted to go to the sun
He wanted to swim in the rain
He wasted his time, drinking whisky and wine
But now he's come back again
He's tried so hard to forget
What others would make him regret
But if I were he I'd listen to me
And keep myself in my head
Keep myself in my head...
A man full of yesterdays
Climbing the ladder once again
But he can feel the strain
He's got to make it through
Forget the mistakes of his youth
He's tried so hard to forget
What others would make him regret
But if I were he I'd listen to me
And keep myself in my head
He wanted to go to the sun
He wanted to swim in the rain
He wasted his time, drinking whisky and wine
But now he's come back again
You might also likeHe's come back again...
A man full of yesterdays
Climbing the ladder once again
But he can feel the strain
A man full of yesterdays
Climbing the ladder once again
But he can feel the strain
Again, he's come back again
He's come back againEmbed
