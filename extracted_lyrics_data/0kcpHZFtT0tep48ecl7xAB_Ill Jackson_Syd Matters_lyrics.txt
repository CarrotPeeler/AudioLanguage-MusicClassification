6 ContributorsIll Jackson Lyrics
I won’t let anyone contest
The laws of aerodynamics
And I won’t let any man disturb
The fluid mechanics

One thing I recall is my birth
Does it sound that silly?
Wish I had somebody to trust
Do I look like a lady?

Is there any woman on Earth
Who’ll bring me back my voucher?
One thing I recall is my first
Dead flower picture
Jackson lost his mind when he left us
When he started to use some strange words in conversations

Hey now, help is on the way now
Help is on the way now
It’s over, help is on the way now
Help is on the way now
He’d better recognize us
Better recognize us
You might also like
Back off, you sneaky little judge
I was just trying on my own
I am only playing in the mud
And this wasn’t meant to be shown

One thing I recall is my birth
Does it sound that silly?
Jackson lost his mind when he left us
Shame on the crazed Jackson

Up the fence, where did you go?
Between a jump and a bounce the difference you know
Is the fog you left behind
All around us
All around usEmbed
