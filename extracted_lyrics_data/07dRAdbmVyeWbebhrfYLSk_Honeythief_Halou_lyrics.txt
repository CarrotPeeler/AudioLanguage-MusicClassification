7 ContributorsHoneythief Lyrics
Sometimes I doubt the path I chose
Sometimes my dreams feel all on hold
There's no doubt that this will make me strong
'Cause it's the hardest thing I've ever done

Despite this cruel world
And all my best efforts
You surprise me with just how perfect you are
Even with all my flaws
And my bad examples
You surprise me with
Just how perfect you are

And when I'm lost
You search for me
And when I doubt
You're my belief
I'm supposed to be the stronger one
You always seem to prove that theory wrong

Still, I hold my breath each time you go
Out in the world that's beyond my control
If you are dreaming
I never want to wake you up
You might also like
Despite this cruel world
And all my best efforts
You surprise me with just how perfect you are
Even with all my flaws
And my bad examples
You surprise me with
Just how perfect you are

When I'm all in a spin
Full of cynicism
You remind me of just how perfect you are
When I'm at my witâ€™s end
And I'm losing my head
You remind me of just how lucky I am4Embed
