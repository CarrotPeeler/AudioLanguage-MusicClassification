2 ContributorsQuicksand Lyrics
Key about to snap! Tell them get they cameras
Got more bars than a slammer
Correct like grammar, Hard-Headed like a hammer
So don't get comfortable like pajamas
Amateurs I mean that
Bring a plastic bag full of green
And a backpack with some mean
Knapsack full of beans
Shake up with my team, all this in front of my Dean
Watch ya back like a spleen
I'm hopscotching your dreams, if you know what I mean
Mean with the flow
Have your girl running back, cause she know I give and go
Never make a wrong move, stay up on my pivot though
No wonder how they notice me, I'm something like piss in snow
Aw damn, here he go!
Man I beat it out the box like a punch or two
Man you eat it out the box like a lunchable
Feeling like the Huxtables, really untouchable
BOOM over everything, tell them we don't fuck with you!
Yea, right before the store close
Grab a bottle of Goose and Four Lokos
No matter what's the total
Throw it in the back of the Volvo
Watch out for the Po-Po's
BN, that's a logo
Quicksand, die slow
You might also like
Yea, fuck the bullshit cause shit will never be the same
My time is coming at last, like Etta James
I'm going crazy and this rap shit is my medicine
The way I'm moving up
I make you think I was a Jefferson
Way I light it up, I make you think of Thomas Edison
I swear these niggas be on that talking shit
David Letterman
And I'm ill tho, with some ill hoes
The way we fucking, she'll never need a dildo
Yea I rock skinny jeans, who the fuck complaining?
Sit you in a wheel chair like Dick Cheney
Scotti got a disorder, on a pill ain't he?
That's what their saying, but their quotes is just endorsing me
Finna take the game and make it mine like larceny
Rhymes like guns, got a book full of archery
Ya'll could just play or get played like the lottery
I'm waiting for the day the great Jay pass the torch to me
Uh, see that's always been a dream of mine
And The BOOM, yea that's always been a team of mine
I'm just here for relaxing baby free ya mind
I take it back, way back, medieval times
I'm on some other
No luggage, nigga just trippin
My metaphors make you think, yo
Young nigga with a sick flow
Quicksand, die slow
Niggas slept on me, now they got bed bites
I get it shaking like a pair of dice
My bitch look like paradise
She chiefing too, now her eyes red like white mice
Throw in the Vision, now they as clear as white rice
Straight from Cali though
I grabbed the L, no Samuel
How to pearl, I should write a manual
Blowing O's just to impress the hoes
Then bring it up through my nose
French Inhaling, I'm a pro, Oh!
I keep it rolling like the credits at a movie show
Word to AMC
I remember getting brain in the movies
Make the chick sit right next to me
Then put the coat over her just so that no one else could see
Now that's a freak-a-leak, no Peety Pablo
Bars hot as Diablo
The way I paint pictures, they are calling me Picasso
Or Leonardo
And as far as the squad goes
BOOM over everything until I am a fossil
Fresh ass nigga, and you still rocking ropostale
You should follow like apostles
And ketchup like tomatoes
Because my sidelines will kill your top hoe
QUICKSAND, DIE SLOW!Embed
