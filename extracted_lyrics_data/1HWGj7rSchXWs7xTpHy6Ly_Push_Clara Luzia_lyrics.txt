1 ContributorPush LyricsSo I stand here at the corner
Of my thoughts
A pocket full of fantasies
The other's filled with memories
One is doomed to waste away
How mean can it get
And how hard can we fall
Was it my push or was the building too tall
Was it my push or was the building too tall
A huge wall in front of me
A home on my back
Feels like the biblical temptation
And we all know where it ends
Got to walk straight back to where
I came from
But what's behind the wall, what's behind the wall
How mean can it get
And how hard can we fall
Was it my push or was the building too tall
Was it my push or was the building too tallYou might also likeEmbed
