Answer if you can
Won’t somebody to tell me
Just what is the soul of a man
I'm going to ask the question
Please answer if you can
Is there anybody surely can tell me
Hust what is the soul of a man
Well won't somebody tell me
Answer if you can

Well won't somebody tell me

I come up just in time
There was a teacher, a lawyer and a doctor
Saying a man ain't nothing but his mind
