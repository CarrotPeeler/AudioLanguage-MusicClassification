1 ContributorGarbo Goodbye LyricsI've got a sparkling pair of eyes
Especially the right
It was designed to turn around
And watch me from inside
My brain's a wonderful creation
Well connected to my head
God gave me sweet imagination
It's sometimes helpful in bed
Aye aye aye aye
Some say that I was made to touch the sky
Why aye aye aye
Is something holding me down
So won't you fly me to Brasil
If you don't want to stay you know I always will
For every treasure there's a thief
For every clever girl there comes a time to leave
So won't you fly me to the Moon
They'd write about us if we went there by balloon
Just for that headline in the press
They turn to ghetto of success
Aye aye aye aye
Some say that I was made to touch the sky
Why aye aye aye
Is something holding me down
You might also likeI aye aye aye
Won't live a life that is designed for your delight
That's why aye aye
I'll choose a Garbo goodbye
If my desires don't come true
Love won't be what it seems
Love won't provide what love will need
I'll fake it in my dreams
When harmony meets tragedy
Like Bollywood for real
A box-car ride in agony
With me behind the wheel
Aye aye aye aye
Some say that I was made to touch the sky
Why aye aye aye
Is something holding me down
I aye aye aye
Won't live a life that is designed for your delight
That's why aye aye
I'll choose the Garbo goodbye
Aye aye aye aye...
The Garbo goodbye...Embed
