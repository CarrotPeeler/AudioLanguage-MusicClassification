1 ContributorAll You Need Is Love Lyrics(John Lennon/Paul McCartney)
Nothing you can do that can't be done
Nothing you can sing that can't sung
Nothing you couldn't do so you could learn how to play the game
It's easy
All you need is love
All you need is love
All you need is love, love
Love is all you need
Nothing you can make that can't be made
(can't be made)
No-one you can save that can't be save
(can't be saved)
Nothing you could be you couldn't learn how to be in time
It's easy
All you need is love
All you need is love
All you need is love, love
Love is all you need
All you need is love
(love is all we need)
All you need is love
(love is all we want)
All you need is love, love
(all we need, is the love, that we want)
Love is all you needYou might also likeEmbed
