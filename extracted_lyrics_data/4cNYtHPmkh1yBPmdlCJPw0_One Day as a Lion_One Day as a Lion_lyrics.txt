12 ContributorsOne Day As A Lion Lyrics
Blood soaked earth
That you call home
Blood soaked earth
That you call home

Close your eyes but don't sleep
We comin' like People's Army
For the people who can't eat
Who work with no sleep
For the child with no shoes on their feet
A generation who flash heat
Roll up on banks for they cash, see
You're a criminal? You got the nerve to ask me
Tear mics till my voice get raspy
Faced flame for five centuries
And if LA were Baghdad, we'd be Iraqi
With our straps in the backseat next to a general
Tied up with shit in his khakis

Best leave my mic alone, I'm full grown
Off to the green zone
Best leave my mic alone, I'm full grown
And I'm off to the green zone
You might also like
After dark, my city's a fuse
After dark, my city's a fuse
One day, I say today, we live as a lion
After dark, my city's a fuse
After dark, my city's a fuse
One day, I say today, we live as a lion

Blood soaked earth
That you call home

Heard this cat got life in the pen
Crossin' sand in the back of a truck bed
Twelve deep heard sirens and lights red
Smacked on his dome with the club of a white Fed
No food, no water, no rights read
Came north to his seeds and his wife fed
In the middle of the darkest night bled
Stepped to the law, said
Are you a minuteman? Wait a minute, man
Talk like that might limit your life span
After dark, my city's a fuse
One day, I say today, we live as a lion
After dark, my city's a fuse
After dark, my city's a fuse
One day, I say today, we live as a lion

And when our cubs grow
We'll show you what war is good for
And when our cubs grow
We'll show you what war is good for
And when our cubs grow
We'll show you what war is good for
And when our cubs grow
We'll show you what war is good for
And when our cubs grow
We'll show you what war is good for
And when our cubs grow
We'll show you what war is good forEmbed
