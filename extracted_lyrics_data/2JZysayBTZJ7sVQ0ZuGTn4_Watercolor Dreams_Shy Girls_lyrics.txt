I collect dust as I fight and I wander
I walk through love, feels like wildfire
I’m not immune to the vibe with someone else
No, I’m not immune to the lie

But I watched you lay yourself awake
With your watercolor dreams in mind
You bend my spine with only pain, and I'll
Never be the man you wanted
I can’t be the man you wanted to find

Am I a temple for you trust? I’ve made time
I'm done making time for all your reverie
I've watched you fall like all the rest
I’ve got lines I won’t combine by for you, all over you

But I watched you lay yourself awake
With your watercolor dreams in mind
You bend my spine with only pain, and I'll
Never be the man you wanted
I can’t be the man you wanted to find
You might also like

I collect dust as I fight and I wander
I walk through love, feels like wildfire
I’m not immune to the vibe with someone else
No, I’m not immune to the lie
