1 ContributorOf the Flesh LyricsAll desires
Of the world will fade
Of the world will fade
All desires
Of the world will fade
Of the world will fade
Come shake us all
Bury everything
Open the skies
Let it all fall down
Let it all fall down
We need to look outside our possessions
There's so much more
Than what this world can give
What seems important now will seem empty when we have reached the end
There's so much more than what this world can give
Let it all fall down
Let it all fall down
Let it all fall down
Let it all fall down
Let it all fall down
Let it all fall down

To find a love everlasting
We need to search our hearts
To find a love everlasting
Come shake us all
Come shake us all
Bring the end of the world
Bring the end of the world
Bring the end of the world
Let it all fall downEmbed
