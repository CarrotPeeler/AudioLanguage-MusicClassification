Well I was sittin' in a smokey room, band playin' rock and roll
Everybody burnin', yearnin' for some alcohol
I got up to buy the wine, when I saw Shirley Jean
Powdering her nose, posin' like a movie queen
Shirley Jean, sweet little seventeen
Shirley Jean, she's a lovin' machine
I tried to give her a sign, but she was too high to see
Sittin' and starin', carin' not a thing for me
Woo!
Sweet little Shirley Jean, sure lookin' good to me
Jet black stockings, rockin' to the bebop beat
Tell by the way she was actin', musta' had a whole lot to hide
She's got a whole lotta lovin', all bottled up inside
Woo!
{Rod - Slide Solo - Nick - Piano Solo}
I ain't goin to say a word, can't find a word to say
You ain't gonna get me, let me tell you right away

Hugging little Shirley, a curly headed honey pie
Shirley Jean, sweet little seventeen
Shirley Jean, sweet little lovin' machine, well
Shirley Jean, sweet little seventeen
Shirley Jean, she's a lovin' machine
Well, Shirley Jean, sweet little seventeen
Shirley Jean, she's a lovin' machine
Yeah, well, Shirley Jean!
Let me grease your machine!
Let me check your oil
Woo!
Sure looks good to me!Embed
