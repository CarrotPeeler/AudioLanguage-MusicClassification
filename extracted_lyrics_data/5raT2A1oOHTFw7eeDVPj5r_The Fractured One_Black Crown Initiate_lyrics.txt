In this life, it takes the light from our eyes
Though we try, we are not made to walk away from this
And we gaze inside, realizing all that's died
Here it comes again, the fractured one of hostile beauty
In this life, it takes the light from our eyes
Though we try, we are not made to walk away from this
And we gaze inside, realizing all that's died
Binding, enwinding, seducing
Stolen light from our eyes
Binding, enwinding, seducing
Stolen light from our eyes
Who would not hate you for all that you'll never find?
Fear all that's near you and bless all you leave behind
Who would not hate you for all that you'll never find?
Fear all that's near you and bless all you leave behind
Fractured
Binding, enwinding, seducing
Stolen light from our eyes
Binding, enwinding, seducing
Stolen light from our eyes
Who would not hate you for all that you'll never find?
Fear all that's near you and bless all you leave behind
Who would not hate you for all that you'll never find?
Fear all that's near you and bless all you leave behind
Fractured
