1 ContributorLay Back Down LyricsWell baby where you goin' so fast
Let's make a good thing last
Ease your worried, weary mind
And put your troubles all behind
Baby the minutes turn to hours
The hours turn to days
The days, you know the days turn into years
Well girl, I'll be doggone, if I let you slip away
So lay back, lay back down
Stop your fooling around
Better don't put a good thing down
So lay back, lay back down
Ain't no use in trying
Ain't no use in denying what's going wrong
Tell me how can a good thing be wrong
Baby how can a good thing be wrong, now
Minutes turn to hours
Hours turn to days
The days, the days turn into years
Well I'll be doggone, if I let you slip away
So lay back, lay back down
Stop your fooling around
Better don't put a good thing down
Lay back, oh lay back down

Hours turn to days
The days, the days turn into years
Well I'll be doggone, if I let you slip away
So lay back, lay back down
Stop your fooling around
Better don't put a good thing down
Just lay back, lay back down
(fades)
Baby, lay back, lay back down
Stop your fooling aroundEmbed
