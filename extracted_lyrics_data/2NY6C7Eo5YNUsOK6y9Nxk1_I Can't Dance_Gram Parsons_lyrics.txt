I guess my feet don't match
I'd get out there on the floor
But I'm afraid of hurtin' my back
I can't dance
I guess I'm just one of the unfortunate few
So just for a little bit, baby, I'll come out and dance with you
But I can't dance and I'm feelin' so good, yeah
Some of us can, some of us can't
Some of us wish that they could dance
I can't dance
I guess I'm just one of the unfortunate few
So just for a little bit, baby, I'll come out and dance with you
I can't dance and I'm feelin' so good, yeah
Some of us can, some of us can't
Some of us wish that they could dance
I can't dance
I guess I'm just one of the unfortunate few
So just for a little bit, baby, I'll come out and dance with you
Yeah, just for a little bit, baby, I'll come out and dance with you
Yeah, just for a little bit, baby, I'll come out and dance with youYou might also likeEmbed
