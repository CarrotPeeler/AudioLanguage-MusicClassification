1 ContributorNuclear Boy LyricsTake a look at yourself
And then look at us
Take a look at yourself
And then look at us
I don't need your fruit
I've got my Vitamin pills
I said, I don't need nature
With nuclear thrills
I don't need a girl
Who's gonna give birth
Just a blow-up dollie
For a blown-up earth
Nuclear Boy
I don't need real music
Just a disco beat
I said, I don't need the sun
With nuclear heat
I don't need a name
When a number will do
I said, I don't need a brain
Or a point of view

Watch yourself turn nuclear -
Without even noticing!
Disposable people
Disposable lives!
Feed your bodies with filth
Feed your mind with lies
What when the supply runs out
What will we do?Embed
