1 ContributorI Come.com LyricsThis is a new wildlife form speaking through a wireless microphone
I am titanium babe addicted child of your wireless internet
I am a creation of your musical progress of technology
The ancient net-world is gone. You say it's gone. Shit
Fingertips sticked on the keys I engage a new virtual touch of sensuality
Blue eyes on the digital screen I experiment a top secret optical system of visual excitement
On my walls, projection of subliminal messages to increase
A new era of female interactive intuition
And life is a data gas I breathe wireless
You are the creator of my inner life network soundtrackYou might also likeEmbed
