1 ContributorFF SUB LyricsFirst of all Schach you dont know me
I'm not your homie I'm your OG
You just got your start and I'm Kobe
Your potential is a faulty promise
You should probably have a Guilty Conscience
(speaking of that)
Stealing the flow of another artist
I wouldn't excuse this copycat if he was an autist
Hoff I think he's on the spectrum
I think we need an intervention
A pound of cure is worth less than an ounce
Of prevention-
Unless you're selling the pound
This is my town
And I'm everywhere like surround sound
Shows over I should take a bow now
I do it right-
Hold it down smoke loud and keep my parents proud
I'm getting stacks pal
So get your laughs now
But my advice is that you not talk back
I can do more than gloss tracks with bomb raps you dumb ass
Fuck your ex and capture it all in some long snaps
You might also likeLawyer who dont know what contingency means, talking shit to me, can I get a kyke please?
My word holds strong
Better than any bond
Invest in me, or get left out for the best of me
Hop out the whip no watch no chains on
Richest in the room but they don't know Nathan
I'm bout to put my name on buildings
Nate Clein stay hungry like somalian children
For the record I stated
They only hate me now that I made it
Talk shit lets debate it
Never been broke so how you gon break me
Cold blooded, how you gon snake me
You big monotone baby
You really do sound like Erick Sermon
The tall skinny creep version
You get a lot of beauty sleep but its not working
You're basically a sheep thats a non person
That'll never stop hurting
(me?)
I Dance with Wolves like I'm Kevin Costner
Old Blue Eyes,  I Did it My Way like Sinatra
I just manuever the water
I swim with sharks thats how I was brought up
You talking shit is a non starter
You're nothing more than a guppy
Soft centred soft around the edges yuppie
Adopted puppy
A big turkey with no stuffing
Pull your card and catch you bluffing
(You wanna know something)
I'm in a Subaru on Pirellis
You probably somewhere taking selfies
I could be in Peru on the celly
Or on Somerset eating pork belly
I always listen but ain't shit you could really tell me
Writing this from a condo with a terrace view
I'm bout to switch my whole flow up, just to embarrass you
Your voice sounds like your sinuses are full of semen
The white demon
If you thought you had this you were dreaming
Heres some things I take as given:
You're not real
Every hoe is on the pill
Today Reid wore a hat with a curved bill
I went crazy chasing my first mil and I'm insane still
I've been off the chain a long time, haven't you heard?
In my circle I'm a gold mine with proven reserves
I'm off the chain, but I kept the links
Take you to the Brinks like a bank truck
Listen Ed Harris you ain't got The Right Stuff
You ain't tough, peep the trend
I'm bout to go off the deep end, collecting commas
I feel it coming like the Weeknd or Nostadamus
Drone strike you like Obama
I'm so nuts Davey needs to stay away
Your pay comes late well I get paid every day
5 minutes with your partners is worth the charge
Cuz after they hear these diss bars
You will be dis-barred
Girls wetter than a skidoo
Game incoming like Reboot
I saw it all since preschool
I just had to go and do it
You don't want to get into it
Wake up in a hospital eating fluids
So when they ask you say it wasn't me
Cuz they don't make chicken parm in a IV
I dont care who's grass your grazing theres none greener than mine
They lied
The grass isn't always greener on the other side
Josh Kriesman hasn't always been a guy
He was born as an Earthworm named Jim
One day you can maybe be as nice as I am
If you eat your greens and stop taking naps
Stop shopping at Baby Gap
Stop sucking Sherman's dick like a gravy tap
In a sitch where you'd ask who is who
I just do the thing that's what doers do
Get the moving crew
I stay working off a couple burners
In the streets I am Steven Kerzner
A Mad Man like Jon Hamm
Bloodsport like Van Damme
I'm just on some kickback shit, like Szabadi's Dad
Don't ask me questions
This isn't a lesson
I'm just sharing facts
You're getting too skinny and your whack
You told your partners shit about me
Where do you get off trying to out me
(You have no clout b)
You act tall but I wish you would play
I'm 5'8" on a good day
But you stay on your knees
And if I stand on my cheese
You'd be under my feet
Remember I didn't start it, you shot first
Wanna battle but I'm ending the war with one verse
People fronting but its really nothing
Best of luck to you Buzzy cousins
Fantasy football scrub
Chasing a meatball sub
I'm doneEmbed
