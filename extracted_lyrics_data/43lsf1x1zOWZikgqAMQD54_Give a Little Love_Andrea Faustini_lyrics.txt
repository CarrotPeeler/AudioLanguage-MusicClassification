2 ContributorsGive A Little Love Lyrics
Dark to light
A thousand stars collide
You and I
Were made to feel alive

But they took your smile and knocked you down
It's like the secret was forgotten

But if you give a little love
And if it's with an open heart
It's all you need to set you free
Yeah, it just makes sense to me

Could be kind
Those chances pass you by
Wrong or right
Guess only you decide

But they took your light and knocked you down
It's like the secret was forgotten
You might also like
But if you give a little love
And if it's with an open heart
It's all you need to set you free
Yeah it just makes sense to me
So if you give a little love
Say a prayer when times get rough
It's all you need to set you free
Yeah it just makes sense to me

Yeah it does
It just makes, it just makes sense to me
It just makes sense to me

But if you give a little love
And if it's with an open heart
It's all you need to set you free
Yeah it just makes sense to me
So if you give a little love
Say a prayer when time gets rough
It's all you need to set you free
Yeah it just makes sense to me
Yeah it just makes sense to meEmbed
