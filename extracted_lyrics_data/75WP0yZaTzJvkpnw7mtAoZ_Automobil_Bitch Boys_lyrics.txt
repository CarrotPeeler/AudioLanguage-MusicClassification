Big big bank, I get bread
Rich ass throwa, I got street cred
Big big Drac' filled with lead
Whatever you want, that's how we play it
Big big Cubans 'round my neck
I say, "Cheese," that's VVS
Big big foreign, I spent a check
Real big bank, yeah, big big flex
Big big bank, I get bread
Rich ass throwa, I got street cred
Big big Drac' filled with lead
Whatever you want, that's how we play it
Big big Cubans 'round my neck
I say, "Cheese," that's VVS
Big big foreign, I spent a check
Real big bank, yeah, big big flex

Big big Benz with the digital dash
Pullin' off the lot, I spent big cash
I'ma trap star playin' with a big bag
It's just somebody bitch, boy, you goin' out sad
Designer on my body, that's a big big tag
I cash out at Saks, go straight to the back
I'm pullin' Dior, Burberry off the rack
I don't ask him how much 'cause I got me a sack
You might also like
Big big bank, big Ben Frank's
Big big general, big big rank
Big big Drac', I won't shoot blanks
Leave you stank, fuck what you think
Big big plate, gonna chop steak
State 48, it's a regular day
Big big drank, pour up a eighth
I fucked 'round and ran out, I need a new case

Big big weight, your trap shake
My trap boom, your trap earthquake
I fronted a pack, let me see if he play
He said he got robbed, think he lied to my face
Okay, okay, load up the Drac'
How you gon' play when I know where you stay?
I make one call and I'm sendin' them apes
I drop 'em a bag and I get you erased
You play with my cape, big mistake
I know niggas who want you dead anyway
You play with my cape, big mistake
I know niggas who want you dead anyway

Okay, okay, load up the Drac'
How you gon' play when I know where you stay?
I make one call and I'm sendin' them apes
I drop 'em a bag and I get you erased
Big big bank, I get bread
Rich ass throwa, I got street cred
Big big Drac' filled with lead
Whatever you want, that's how we play it
Big big Cubans 'round my neck
I say, "Cheese," that's VVS
Big big foreign, I spent a check
Real big bank, yeah, big big flex
Big big bank, I get bread
Rich ass throwa, I got street cred
Big big Drac' filled with lead
Whatever you want, that's how we play it
Big big Cubans 'round my neck
I say, "Cheese," that's VVS
Big big foreign, I spent a check
Real big bank, yeah, big big flex

Big big racks  big packs
Sippin' on Wock', couldn't find no Act'
Big big strap to sit on my lap
Keep it on me, who you think about to jack?
Big big cap, these niggas cap
They don't live the shit that they put in they raps
Can't show me ten bands, but you claim you were trappin'
In a automobile? You drivin' what?
Big big gas, not even premium
I sell petrol just like Shell
Big big hustler, I'm a finnesse-er
I swear I could sell water to a whale
Big big Trip, I'm a big big plug
I be down to let a bitch play me like a scrub
Ain't wearin' no cape, we ain't savin' no dud
Like Erica Banks, are you fuckin' or what?
Big big bank, big Ben Frank's
Big big general, big big rank
Big big Drac', I won't shoot blanks
Leave you stank, fuck what you think
Big big plate, gonna chop steak
State 48, it's a regular day
Big big drank, pour up a eighth
I fucked 'round and ran out, I need a new case

Big big bank, I get bread
Rich ass throwa, I got street cred
Big big Drac' filled with lead
Whatever you want, that's how we play it
Big big Cubans 'round my neck
I say, "Cheese," that's VVS
Big big foreign, I spent a check
Real big bank, yeah, big big flex
Big big bank, I get bread
Rich ass throwa, I got street cred
Big big Drac' filled with lead
Whatever you want, that's how we play it
Big big Cubans 'round my neck
I say, "Cheese," that's VVS
Big big foreign, I spent a check
Real big bank, yeah, big big flexEmbed
