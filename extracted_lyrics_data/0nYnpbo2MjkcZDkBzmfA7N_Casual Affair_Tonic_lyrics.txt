3 ContributorsCasual Affair Lyrics
So you give it all, in the world today
You say it's all about the passion and the wars you wage
I'm not sayin' I'm one for violence, but it keeps me hangin' on

It's a casual affair
When everybody loves you
Oh, they'll pay top dollar, make you wear the dog collar baby
When everybody loves you

I said I'm not afraid of change, I'm not afraid to lose
They say it's all about the sacrifice, and the weapons you choose
Like I said, I'm not one for violence, but it keeps me hangin' on

It's a casual affair
When everybody loves you
Oh, they'll pay top dollar, make you wear the dog collar baby
When everybody loves you


It's a casual affair
When everybody loves you
Oh, they'll pay top dollar, make you wear the dog collar baby
When everybody loves you
It's a casual affair
When everybody loves you
Oh, they'll pay top dollar, yeah
When everybody loves youYou might also like1Embed
