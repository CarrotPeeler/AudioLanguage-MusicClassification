5 ContributorsOut of the Crowd LyricsI won't compete because I don't need to be
In front of someone that wants to compete with me
Who needs another aggravation
Or a fucked up situation
So you call me burnt out
Call me washed up
Or weaker cause I won't get up
Be first in another line
Just one more time
Cause I won't compete again
I can't hear a sound that's out of the crowdYou might also likeEmbed
