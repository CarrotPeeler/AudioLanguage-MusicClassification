6 ContributorsIn My Mode Lyrics
Ey yea yea
You know my, you know my, you know my, you know my...
You know my, you know my steelo, you know my steelo
You know my, you know my, you know my, you know my

You know my mustache
You know my M.O
You know my crib
You know where I live
You know my demo
My blood is Freon
That below zero
I'm fixin' Fiji water coming out my peehole (hahaha)
I got a closet where I hide my new kimonos in the chinos
I just got a 3-D printer and I printed out a kilo
Alright! Just keep it on the d-low
P was on the real
On the real, I'on't like diamonds like Neil
But I could cop 'em
I'm just looking for a thot that'll sacrifice her body
For some more chakra for me
I need more chakra to eat
It's like chocolate to me
Just pussy pop for a creep
A recovering sex addict who talks to the trees
I'm in tune with the leaves
I be in tune with the season
Better salute when you see me (yeah yeah)
You might also like
I put a nigga down if he acting wild
I put a nigga down right, right...
I remember 6th grade sitting in sex-ed
The teacher asked how can she help me first thing I said...

Put me in my mode
Put me in my way
Put me with some hoes
Put me in my lane
Hell yeah, hell yeah (HELL YEAH)
Hell yeah, hell yeah (HELL YEAH)
Hell yeah, hell yeah
Put me in my mode
Just give me a stove in the kitchen
Ima whip it, Ima whip it, Ima whip it
Just put me on the stove
Put me with some hoes
Just put me with some hoes
Put me in my lane
Put me in my lane
(whistling)

I need a drink show me the lake
These hoes, I save 'em all give me the cake
No hesitation, I'm never ever waiting
If I see a bitch in danger
I turn to a power ranger
I protect them
Give 'em what they need and check them
With the shinigami cells then proceed with the testing
Man, and she ain't even know it
It's a war outside don't go outside BLOW IT
You go out blinded
You know that I'm go find ya
Blink 3 times and I'm right behind ya
Might like a bitch pic but I ain't leave no comment
Felt like the first time that I summoned Bahamut
When I 
I am the key
Papi showed me to the lock and now I'm getting geeked
Ooh what a relief, remember me?!
Well you got to leave
I got a business to be ran
Villains to protect
People can be killed if I fail
They probably want the chakra that I wield
While you dick-riding
Out there shopping for a deal
I created my own lane
So put me in my own...
