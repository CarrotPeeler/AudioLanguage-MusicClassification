3 ContributorsShouting In A Bucket Blues LyricsSometimes I get too drunk
I feel so goddamned low
I have no place to go, no one to turn to
I think about your loving arms, where I'd like to be
But it's selfish as can be, and I know it
And if I'm sorry for myself, I'm sorry for you too
'cause I'm the same as you, and I'm burning
So I sing for everyone who feels there's no way out
So maybe if you all shout someone will hear you
Listen to them shout
I won't say that I love you, 'cause that would be a lie
I can only say I try, and you know it
Love is something more or less than words can hope to say
It's something day to day in the life we're living
Lovers come and lovers go but friends are hard to find
Yes I can count all mine on one finger
So I sing for everyone who feels there's no way out
So maybe if you all shout someone will hear you
Listen to them shout
The distance that's between us, it just never seems to change
There's a whole mountain range of misunderstanding
You might also likeSo I sing for everyone who feels there's no way out
So maybe if you all shout someone will hear you
Listen to them shoutEmbed
