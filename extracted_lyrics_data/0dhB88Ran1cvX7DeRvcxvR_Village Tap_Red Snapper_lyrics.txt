1 ContributorBack Then (Feat. Ron Pryce & Daz Léone) Lyrics
Wait, wait, wait, wait, yeah
Okay

Back then
You ain’t want me now you on me
Bitch what happen
Is it cause ya hood rat friends said my shit slappin'
Coulda never reach you now you tryna tap in

Oh you heard that I’m a lit ass fuckin' rapper
This ain’t Gucci but groovy I’m so dapper
Always lying making scenes you a actor
For the gram for the likes captain capper
Man a Move fishy just like red snapper
All the actin' all the cappin' gotta stop
Steady bragging 'bout shit you don’t even got
Moving like a top man but we know you not
Plus you got a baby by a fuckin' thot
Supa got the ether kick
Shit nigga no fifa bitch
Blow me like the reefer I
Fuck her but don’t keep her might
Want her but don’t need her
Keep it black and white no zebra
Clip her faster than a cheetah
Got more paper than her
You might also like[Hook- Supa Dupa Humble}
Back then
You ain’t want me now you on me
Bitch what happen
Is it cause ya hood rat friends said my shit slappin'
Coulda never reach you now you tryna tap in
Coulda never even get your number
Back then
You ain’t want me now you on me
Bitch what happen
Is it cause ya hood rat friends said my shit slappin'
Coulda never reach you now you tryna tap in
Coulda never even

Pussy popping, made you nervous
Don’t you serve a purpose in the loop
Hoolie hoop meet me at the circus
Columbine from behind
Baby you deserve it did the most
Pac man chasing holy ghost I’m on you hoe
Gobble gobble taste like turkey roast I’m roasting turkey
From Albuquerque I got all the smoke
And if you feenin' I'll have you leaning to my antidote
In your veins cocaine
Don’t I feel like dope
Said she want me now but
I don’t give a fuck
I don’t give a fuck
But I let her suck
On my nuts
In my truck
Bust my nut
On her butt
Look in my eyes bitch
While you ride that dick
Spit in yo face
You be with the shits
I’m just saying
I’m just playing
No I’m not
Gimme kiss

Bitch I been on
Fuck a slim jawn with my timbs on
Came here on a mission
She left here with no ring on
King Kong, on the top floor of these buildings
I’m not a role model
Put some earplugs on your children
I need a fuck and suck
Bitch ready and she willing
We fuck on top my money
Hit my head up on the ceiling
Villain, take your wifey to my layer
Ass on Buffy, you know I gotta slay her
She gon' need an aspirin
I fed that bitch a Bayer
She tell me all her problems
But bitch I do not care
Cause back then
You ain’t want me now you on me
Bitch what happen
Is it cause ya hood rat friends said my shit slapping
Coulda never reach you now tryna tap in
Coulda never even get your number back then
You ain’t want me now you on me bitch what happen
Is it cause ya hood rat friends said my shit slapping
Coulda never reach you now tryna tap in
Coulda never even get your number back thenEmbed
