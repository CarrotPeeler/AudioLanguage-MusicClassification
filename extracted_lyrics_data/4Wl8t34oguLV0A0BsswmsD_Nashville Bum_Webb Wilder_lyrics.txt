1 ContributorNashville Bum LyricsNashville Bum
I've been chasin' the big wheels
All over Nashville
Waitin' on my big break to come
Livin' on ketchup soup
Homemade crackers and Kool-aid
I'll be a star tomorrow but today
I'm a Nashville bum
I look good in cowboy clothes
And I sing thru my nose
Old Webb says that's the way to get'er done
I smoke that old PA
Like the Opry stars they say
I'll be a star tomorrow but today
I'm a Nashville bum
Don't bum me out
Well a friend of a friend of mine
Is a friend of Ort Divine
He finally got me on the Opry show
I walked out just like a star
Tripped and busted my guitar
I'll be a star tomorrow but today
Well I'm a Nashville bum
You might also likeWell here's a song that I wrote
By myself note for note
With a lot of help it might make number one
You can change a word or two
I'll give half to you
I'll be a star tomorrow but today
I'm a Nashville bum
I'll be a star tomorrow but today
Well I'm a Nashville bumEmbed
