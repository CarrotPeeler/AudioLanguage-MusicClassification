2 ContributorsDeadlihood Lyrics
The sun is shining
And everything's dying
Your star has burned out for good
Somewhere in Hollywood

What the hell?
This ain't no way to treat the living dead
Is this something from a novel that you read?
It's time to cut the cord and say goodbye
'Cause it's the only thing that hasn't happened yet
And when it does, I'll wish we'd never met
I did the best I could

The sun is shining
But everything's dying
Your star has burned out for good
Somewhere in Hollywood
I swear you told me
That you'd be my life support
Guess I misunderstood
You were my deadlihood

Hey
You're the sanity that's driving me insane
Well, heaven knows that I'd erase you if I could
Oh God I wish I could
(God I wish I could)
You might also like
The sun is shining
But everything's dying
Your star has burned out for good
Somewhere in Hollywood
I swear you told me
That you'd be my life support
Guess I misunderstood
You were my deadlihood


The sun is shining
And everything's dying
Your star has burned out for good
Somewhere in Hollywood

The sun is shining
But everything's dying
Your star has burned out for good
Somewhere in Hollywood
I swear you told me
That you'd be my life support
Guess I misunderstood
You were my deadlihoodEmbed
