12 ContributorsMountain Dew Lyrics
Tryna shine like the sun and the moon (CA$HED COHBRUHZ production, lil' ho)
Can't fall in love with a ho, I refuse
Drippin' like I just got out of a pool (Eat my pussy)
Smokin' on dope, I'm dazed and confused
High on the shrooms, I'm seeing cartoons
Hi-C the highest nigga in the room
Hi-C the flyest nigga in the room
She choosing on me—

(Bitch—bitch—bitch, is you stupid?)
(It's DJ SKR3WF4CE you lil' bum, ugly ass ho)
(CA$HED COHBRUHZ production, lil' ho, eat my pussy)

I'm tryna shine like the sun and the moon (CA$HED COHBRUHZ production, lil' ho)
Can't fall in love with a ho, I refuse
Drippin' like I just got out of a pool (Eat my pussy)
Smokin' on dope, I'm dazed and confused
High on the shrooms, I'm seeing cartoons
Hi-C the highest nigga in the room
Hi-C the flyest nigga in the room
She choosing on me 'cause I got the juice
She rainin' on me like my soul, rainin' on me like my soul
There ain't no way that's your bae, The Weeknd, she lovin' the crew
Her friend wanna fuck on me too, her friends wanna suck on me too (They wanna fuck me too)
These niggas is hoes, we cannot be cool, we don't even know who the fuck is you
All of my niggas is wild just like a pack of baboons (A pack of baboons)
I just poured a deuce inside my Mountain Dew
She wanna give me her heart, bitch, I'ma rip it in two (Rip it in two)
She open her legs, drippin' just like a fucking open wound (Just like an open wound)
Yeah on this hoe, just like a blunt, we get high on the fumes
I pop a bean or two to get me in the groove
My clique a pack of wolves, these niggas look like food
I lied to my ho, I'm wearing Trues, the kush is my perfume
Just like the stars and moon, you know I got the boof
These bitches go diego go, but that's on the low
I'm tryna get the dough and Trues on all my clothes (On my clothes)
Louis bag, private jets straight to Tokyo (Straight to Tokyo)
Hockey sticks make me look like I'm from Tokyo (Woah)
Lean on the blunt and it got a nigga eyes so low (CA$HED COHBRUHZ production, lil' ho)
Hockey sticks make me look like I'm from Tokyo (Eat my pussy, Tokyo)
Lean on the blunt and it got a nigga eyes so low
Bitch, I'm straight to Tokyo (Straight to Tokyo)
Louis bags, private jets straight to Tokyo (Tokyo)
Hockey sticks and it got a nigga eyes so low
Lean on the blunt and it got a nigga eyes so low
