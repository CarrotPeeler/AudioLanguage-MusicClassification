3 Contributors4th Floor by 22-20s LyricsWhat lies behind the door tonight
Don’t fool yourself you might be surprised
Time has taught you slow
Keep expectations low
All your mistakes are kept for revenge
Will you be forced to live them again
Time has taught you slow
But you should know by now
You should know by now
Walk away
The pleasure isn’t worth the pain
You said forever then but things have changed
There’s no treasure hidden here to gain
What brings you to the 4th floor tonight
Don’t fool yourself you might be surprised
Time has taught you slow
Where conversations go
Bend till you break and take all the shame
Make all the moves
And take all the blame
Time has taught you slow
But you should know by now
You should know by now x 2
Walk away
The pleasure isn’t worth the pain
You said forever then but things have changed
There’s no treasure hidden here to gain
Here for the sake of the start
You never imagined a fall so far
Now everythings falling apart
Walk away
The pleasure isn’t worth the pain
You said forever then but things have changed
There’s no treasure hidden here to gain
What lies behind the door tonight
Don’t fool yourself you might be surprised
Time has taught you slow
Keep expectations low
All your mistakes are kept for revenge
Will you be forced to live them again
Time has taught you slow
But you should know by now
You should know by now
You should know by now
