4 ContributorsConfessions Lyrics(Intro)
You know the name, im not a fake...had to make that clear
(Verse 1)
Had to let you know like this I don't want to hurt no one feelings hurts to even say this on the page tho I don't want to feel the pain(oh) so I had to turn my heart ice cold so I don't have to know if what I did was wrong I got a feeling bout fuck the world cause tomorrows not promised so i might as well make my confessions today I don't want to know what these niggas say cause half of ya are snakes and im your prey and ya want to hate so I have to fight my way to get to end of this motha fucking struggle okay you know how I be they want to hate on z
(Chorus)
These are my confessions don't know who be pressed on but I know Ima make a presence these are my confessions
(Verse 2)
This is where we rap and im back i've been trying to wash this pain like a drink but it won't go away its lingering in the sink Im starting to get to my brink im starting to think what happens in every moment if im ever gone will people remember me or will I be known as a bigon I want to make me know I want to know what is home you know Im trying to let you know like this im trying to spit my shit I hurt all over and it feels like shit I don't know what people think of me I want my to be know as z or a king so
(Chorus)
These are my confessions don't know who be pressed on but I know Ima make a presence these are my confessions
