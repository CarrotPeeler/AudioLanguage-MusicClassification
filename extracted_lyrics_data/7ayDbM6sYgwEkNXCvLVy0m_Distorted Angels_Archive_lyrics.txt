Calling on motion
Fueling descending
Falling unending
Caught up in circles
Distorted angels
This place is crazy
God it’s so cold
I can see in your eyes
A stone up in your hair
You say when you’re mine
Praying praying for
With the sting
Of your tears
Burning through the ground
There’s a fear in your eyes
Enclose surrender
Breaking is tender
Sliding disfigured
Driving that death drum into your heart
Caught up in static dreams
Distorted angels sing

Cause you move through this world
As a stone up in your hair
And you hold in your hands
Dying dying for
A release from the tears
That holds you to the ground
Close the fear in your eyes
Violence is crushing
Rushing and played by
A brutal obsession
To shatter the buildings and throw out the line
Caught up with angels
Distorted angels
This dream is fading now it is gone
Cause you move from this world
With a stone left in your hand
You have in your eyes
Searching searching for
A feeling of the tears
That burnt you to the ground
There’s a fear
There’s a fear3Embed
