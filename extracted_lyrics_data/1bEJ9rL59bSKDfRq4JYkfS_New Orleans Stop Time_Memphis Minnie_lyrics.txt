Say, Bumblebee
Yeah?
Boy, where you been so long?
California
You didn't forgot that New Orleans stop-time, did you?
No, not at all
I want to see you do some of it
Okay Minnie
You don't mind, do you?
Not at all
Well, all right then, let's go
Okay
That's what you're talking 'bout?
Look at old Bumpy, ain't he super?
You know what I'd like to see you do?
What's that, man?
That old "snake hip", look like your bones break in two
Okay
Come on, give it to me now
Okay
All right
Ooh, look at that man, look like his bones break in two
How you like that, Minnie? That's new

Don't you know, you used to go dance too?
Well, I can do a little bit now
Can you?
Yeah
Well, how about a little break there, yeah?
What you want me to do?
I want you to do those "Shim-sham-shimmies"
"Shim-sham-shimmy?!"
Yeah, mix it up though, like you used to do
Well, all right
Okay, let's see you do it
How you like that?
That's tearing 'em up, Minnie
I do believe I'm adding a little new stuff, Minnie
Ooh-ooh
Colo-red, look at Minnie
Look at that, my God almighty
Yeah, everybody get some of it now
Everybody dance
Well, all right then
Yeah, look at that
