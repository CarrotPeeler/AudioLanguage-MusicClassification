Looking back now, I can see
The ghost of myself as I used to be
Looking back now, I can see
The ghost of myself haunting me

It's an undistinguished room with a single bed
I used to share with you at the weekend
Books and records, new wave and disco
We'll go for a swim and then the Cafe Picasso

Looking back now, I can see
The ghost of myself as I used to be
Looking back now, I can see
The ghost of myself haunting me

You can see them by the pub, rockabilly boys
Camera crews in Flood Street for the election
Mohicans, Sloanes, Clones go their own way
You packed up your stuff, I went to the V and A

Looking back now, I can see
The ghost of myself as I used to be
Looking back now, I can see
The ghost of myself haunting me
You might also like
Looking back now, I can see
The ghost of myself wondering what to be
Looking back now, I can see
The ghost of myself searching for the key

Haunted by my shy self, the things we used to do
The sudden ghost of myself getting it on with you

Looking back now, I can see
The ghost of myself wondering what to be
Looking back now, I can see
The ghost of myself searching for the keyEmbed
