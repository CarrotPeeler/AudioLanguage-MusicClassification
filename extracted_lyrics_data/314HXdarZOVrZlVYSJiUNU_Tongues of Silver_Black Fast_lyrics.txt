1 ContributorTongues of Silver LyricsAltars have burned
In wakeless states I've lapsed
Spires I've seen, crashing dreams
Of vapors and visions
Escaping, entranced
Coming to and though possession
Other forms and shattered worlds
Out of the wreckage, in the coming swarm
Beyond deprivation
Eradication of light interred
Silenced ghost sing unheard
Dying language, silver tongues
Conquered ancients spilling blood
Come the order, come the pain
Come neglect, into the fray
Come the reckoning, come the suffering
Subjugation, all enslaved
Frothing mouth, the river writhes
Clotting, the horror, swarming flies
Silver tongues, drowning floods
Claiming victims, putrefied
Seal it off, dealing death
Running out, sewing mouths
Starving lungs, depriving, explode and drown
The silver tongued ancients
Meeting reprise
Of silenced ghosts
