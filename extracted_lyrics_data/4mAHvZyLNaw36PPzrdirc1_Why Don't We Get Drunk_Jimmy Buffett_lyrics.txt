1 ContributorWhy Donâ€™t We Get Drunk LyricsI really do appreciate the fact you're sittin' here
Your voice sounds so wonderful
But your face don't look too clear
So barmaid, bring a pitcher another round o' brew
Honey, why don't we get drunk an' screw?
Why don't we get drunk an' screw?
I just bought a waterbed, it's filled up for me an' you
They say you are a snuff queen
Honey, I don't think that's true
So, why don't we get drunk an' screw?
Pick it, Coral Reefers, here we go
Why don't we get drunk an' screw?
I just bought a waterbed, it's filled up for me an' you
They say you are a snuff queen
Honey, I don't think that's true
So why don't we get drunk an' screw?
Yeah, now, baby, I say
Why don't we get drunk an' screw?You might also likeEmbed
