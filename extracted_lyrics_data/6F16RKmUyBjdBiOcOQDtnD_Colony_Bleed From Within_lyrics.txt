Without any one of you
There would be none of us
We said we won't let you down
That's why we're still here
Because of you we still have a reason
For believing in ourselves
We said, we said
Nothing would ever change
It was nothing that could break us
But nothing stays the same
We owe your lives to you
'Cause life can be forgiving when you're living for yourself
It feels like I'm on the right path for a change
We owe it all to you
So throw your fist in the air if we were on the same page
Scream as loud as you can if you can't feel a thing
I feel nothing without you
That's why we're still here
Because of you we still have a reason
For believing in ourselves
You might also likeWe said these were the dark days of our lives
But you shine a light on me to guide me through the dark
We owe our lives to you
'Cause life can be forgiving when you're living for yourself
It feels like I'm on the right path for a change
How can you say this is not for me?
Let me live my life in the way I want it to be
If only you can see this through my eyes
We owe it all to you
So throw your fist in the air if we were on the same page
Scream as loud as you can if you can't feel a thing
So throw your fist in the air if we were on the same page
Scream as loud as you can if you can't feel a thing
I feel nothing without you
Scream as loud as you can
Scream as loud as you can
But don't turn away
Giving up on everything is easier than you think
I'll never turn my back on you
You have become our legacy
You're the light that guides us through the dark days
You gave us hope, we thought it couldn't be saved
You're the light that guides us through the dark days
You gave us hope, we thought it couldn't be savedEmbed
