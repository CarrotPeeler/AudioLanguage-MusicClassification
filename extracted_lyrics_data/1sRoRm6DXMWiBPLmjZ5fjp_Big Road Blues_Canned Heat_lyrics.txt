Oh well, I ain't goin' down that big road by myself
Oh Lord now, I ain't goin' down that big road by myself
Lord, can't carry my baby, gonna carry somebody else

Oh well, the sun gonna shine into my back door someday
Oh yeah well, the sun gonna shine into my back door someday
Well, big wind's gonna come up and blow my blues away


Big Aida left Savannah, Lord, it did not stop you, what a sort of  daughter, fireman, went and got the ball of hardware
Reach in the corner, mama, hand me my travelin' shoes
Well, you know by that I've got them big road blues


Oh well, the sun gonna shine into my back door some
My back door some, someday, Lord
The sun gonna shine into my back door someday
Well, a big wind's gonna come up and blow my blues away

Oh well, I ain't goin' down that big road by my
I said by my, by myself, Lord
I ain't goin' down that big road by myself
Lord, can't carry my baby, gonna carry somebody elseSee Canned Heat LiveGet tickets as low as $41You might also likeEmbed
