10 ContributorsThe Black and White Lyrics
Mr. McCarthy killed the light
He didn't wake his lovely wife
He left the key inside the door
Woke on the wrong side of the bed
She can't remember what he said
But she sure knew what he had done

Little choices in a, a little town
Maybe a little man is right to be afraid
Biblic moralization, identity frustration
Biblic man cannot follow his heart
So he may be fucking her, but he's thinking about him

Catherine MacKinnon does exist
She likes to call herself a feminist
A crusader who fights the pat
But what she really hates is sex
Erotic images oppress
And debase women as a whole

Simple solutions created by black and white thinking
Too bad the world don't work that way
Catherine should get busy porkin' that dolt Andrea Dworkin
I think they need a good hard fuck
'Cause she may be off her back, now she needs to get off ours

The little man sits all alone
His sexuality's been cut in stone
He don't love her, she don't really care
Two victims of the black and white
The black and whiteEmbed
