But the truth be told you're about to fold
Funk the dumb stuff (Funk the dumb stuff)
You think you're hot, to hot to stop
But what you got, its about to flop
Funk the dumb stuff (Funk the dumb stuff)
You think you're bad, but ain't it sad
Realistically you can be had
Funk the dumb stuff (Funk the dumb stuff)
You think you're good, as good as gold
But you're jive trip be getting old
Funk the dumb stuff (Funk the dumb stuff)
If you funk with me, I'll funk with you
If you funk with me, I'll funk with you
If you funk with me, I'll funk you too!
You think you're hip, hip to the tip
But with all that lip, you're about to slip
Funk the dumb stuff (Funk the dumb stuff)
You think you're cool, too cool for school
But out of the pool, you're just a fool
Funk the dumb stuff (Funk the dumb stuff)
See Tower of Power LiveGet tickets as low as $62You might also likeYou think you're slick, so smooth and quick
On the real side, you're in a trip
Funk the dumb stuff (Funk the dumb stuff)
And you think you're bold, as bold as brass
But the truth be told we gonna kick yo
Funk the dumb stuff (Funk the dumb stuff)
If you funk with me, I'll funk with you
If you funk with me, I'll funk with you
If you funk with me, I'll funk you too!Embed
