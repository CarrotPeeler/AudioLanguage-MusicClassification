5 ContributorsDreamer Lyrics
Don't wanna hear no sad songs
I say to the darkness
But it doesn't respond
I ask if I sing a new one
Will I always sing alone?

So long I have known only sorrow
How could I fail to hear
The sound of all the sleeping hearts
The timid hopefuls
Waiting for a path to be cleared?

I can hear a sweet melody
Beneath it all
And it says

Brave dreamer
Dream anew
You won't always dream by yourself
You won't dream by yourself
Everybody's gonna sing along
You might also like
Loneliness has bit my heart
I know it's wounded your heart too
But our longing is our revolution
It's going to bring the world anew

Oh, I can hear a sweet melody
Beneath it all
And it says

Brave dreamer
Dream anew
You won't always dream by yourself
You won't dream by yourself
Everybody's gonna sing along

Is it possible?
I say, yes, it's possible
Made it possible

Oh, I can hear a sweet melody
Beneath it all
And it says
Be brave, dreamer
Dream anew
You won't always dream by yourself
No, hmm, you won't dream by yourself
No, no, you won't dream by yourself
Everybody's gonna sing along
HmmEmbed
