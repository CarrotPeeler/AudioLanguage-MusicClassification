4 ContributorsBlessings Lyrics
I'm really a three times felon, though (JTK, I'm really a three times felon, though)
It's crazy, I came home, I got all this jewelry, got all these Cuban link (Ayy, JB, you sauced up)
Got all this fuckin' money (I don't know how the fuck I get out early)

Three time felon, they let me make it out the block
Two-tone, trench baby, Cuban link with the rocks
I got some money, went and put switches on them Glocks
I got some money, everybody wanna be opps
It's a blessing (It's a blessing)
Young nigga made it out the hood, it's a blessing (It's a blessing)
And when I lost, I turned my L's into lessons (Into lessons)
I 'member all those times I ain't have it (Ain't have it), yeah, ain't have it (Ain't have it)
Three time felon, they let me make it out the block (They let me make out the block)
Two-tone, trench baby, Cuban link with the rocks (With the rocks)
I got some money, went and put switches on them Glocks (Glocks)
I got some money, yeah, everybody wanna be opps
It's a blessing (It's a blessing)

Somebody catch O'Jizzle killer and stretch him
Who ever thought I make it from Cross Weston (From Cross Weston)
Now I got money, bitches calling me best friend (Calling me best friend)
We ain't best friends (We ain't best friends)
Real members 'fore this rap shit, they'll get it done for me (They'll get it done for me)
I don't gotta pay for murders, they'll get it done for free (They'll get it done for free)
Never ran from a nigga when it was only one of me (When it was only one of me)
Even before all this money, niggas used to honor me (Used to honor me)
And they lyin' when they sayin' I put sixty on the opps (Sixty on the opps)
You must got me mixed up, I spent sixty on my watch (I spent sixty on a AP)
Another eight piece, you would hate me, I spent thirty on a Cartier (I spent thirty on a Cartier)
Another twenty on my Barbie, another ticket on her car (Another ticket on her car)
Before this rap shit, I was gettin' busy on the opps (Pew, pew)
You can't discredit my work, the shit I did, it hurt they heart (I did, it hurt they heart)
Fuck the system, fuck the Narcs, and when I did, I did it smart (When I did, I did it smart)
I'm forever gang, gang, fuck what you say, I did my part (I did my part)
I went from trap houses to mansions, slept at cribs, abandon
All you niggas crazy, gay as hell, fucking tranny's (Fucking tranny's)
Pay my momma to watch my kids before I pay a nanny (Before I pay a nanny)
I watch what I say around the kids 'cause I'm a daddy (I'm a daddy)
