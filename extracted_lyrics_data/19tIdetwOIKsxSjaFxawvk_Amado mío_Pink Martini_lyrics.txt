Amado mío, love me forever
And let forever begin tonight
Amado mío, when we're together
I'm in a dream world of sweet delight

Many times I've whispered
"Amado mío"
It was just a phrase that I heard in plays
I was acting a part
But now, when I whisper
"Amado mío"
Can't you tell I care by the feeling there?
'Cause it comes from my heart

I want you ever, I love my darling
Wanting to hold you, and hold you tight
Amado mío, love me forever
And let forever begin tonight


Many times I've whispered
"Amado mío"
It was just a phrase that I heard in plays
I was acting a part
But now, when I whisper
"Amado mío"
Can't you tell I care by the feeling there?
'Cause it comes from my heart

Amado mío, love me forever
And let forever begin tonight

And let forever begin tonight
And let forever begin tonightEmbed
