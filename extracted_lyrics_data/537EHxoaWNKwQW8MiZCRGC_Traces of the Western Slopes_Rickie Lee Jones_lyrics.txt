3 ContributorsTraces of the Western Slopes Lyrics
We go down around
The far side of the track
With Lolitas playing dominoes and poker
Out behind their daddy's shacks
Vacant-eyed, glue-faced boys
On a pearl splashing glass
If they give us any flack
If they come up on our ass
We'll just give 'em the go-by
The Cadillac pass

Take me now
From the blue and pale room I'd follow
Through the faces and the traces of
The treasure I keep hearing inside me
Madmen throw their voices
From pretty boys
And from the best ones
You pick up connections
As they hand you your directions
To the western slope (Yeah)

Well, I lied to my angel so I could take you downtown
Lie to anybody but there's nobody else around
Know what the people say about me
But I lied to my angel
I'm sorry
I saw him
I saw him
Laughing
I could hear them
Laughing
Alive
I could hear them

If you dial in
They're calling from the western Slope
Who's the thin thread of light
That keeps you strangled in the scenery?
That follows my voice—can you see me?
Well, then follow my voice

Who raised this banner?
That no one hears—the Jack
Beneath the axis
Digging under the current
I think someone's trying to get back
But who's qualified to retrieve
The soul's enduring song?
From the grottos of her eyes
And the clashing of the stars

Well, I lied to my angel so I could take you downtown
Lie to anybody but there was nobody else around
Know what the people say about me
Lied to my angel, so they can't find me
I'm sorry
I saw him
Laughing
I saw him
Laughing
We'll be laughing (I saw him)
Laughing (I saw him)
Laughing
I could hear them
E. A. Poe
And Johnny Johnson
If you dial in
They're calling from the western slope
Who's the thin thread of light
That keeps you strangled in the scenery?
That follows my voice—can you see me?
Well, then follow my voice—see me?
