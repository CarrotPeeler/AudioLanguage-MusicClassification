1 ContributorTo The Bone LyricsWhere do you go!
- gone until seven
Why that dreamy smile
Oh whatever
I wish I was somebody with all the moves
Wish I was someone that wouldn't
Get the blues
- I'm so paranoid
Way down all I know
Your loving pulls me through -
I owe it all to you
I know all can go
- and I'm worried to the bone that my
Lover is not my own
...(dont worry - love's going to save you)
Why you messing with me
- gone until seven
Please pick me up your phone
Oh whatever
I know they all want your warmth
Show off their moves
Hate how they cast their charm
Just giving me the blues
I'm so paranoid
Way down all I know
- your loving pulls me through -
I owe it all to you
I know all can go
- and I'm so worried to the bone that
My lover is not my own
...(dont worry - love's going to save you)You might also likeEmbed
