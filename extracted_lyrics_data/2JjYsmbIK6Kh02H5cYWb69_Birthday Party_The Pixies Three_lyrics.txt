5 ContributorsBirthday Party Lyrics
Birthday party!
Birthday party!
Birthday party!
Birthday party!

Gonna have a birthday party
Everybody's invited
Janie, Jimmy and Artie
Gonna make a night of it

Come on, come along
Tonight is the night

Got a whole lot of presents
And a beautiful cake
Gonna blow out the candles
Then a wish I will make

Help me celebrate, don’t be late
Tonight it’s a date
You might also like
I got the latest records we all know
(And we can dance to the radio)
I know that everything would will out right
Just walk down my street to the party lights

Come on, come along
Tonight is the night


I got the latest records we all know
(Or we can dance to the radio)
I know that everything will turn out right
Just walk down my street to the party lights

Gonna have a birthday party
Everybody’s invited
I can wait to get started
'Cause I’m so excited

Come on, come along
Tonight is the night
Happy Birthday to...
Birthday party!
Birthday party!
Birthday party!...Embed
