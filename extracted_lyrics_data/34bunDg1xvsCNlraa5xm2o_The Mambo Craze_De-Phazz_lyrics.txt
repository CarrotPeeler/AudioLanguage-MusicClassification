Why, Lucy, your eyes are filled with tears
My heart is strained with gladness
Oh look, the orchestra is getting ready
Dance with me, George!

Check the scene outside of Medellin
Make a fuss in Caracas
Big cigars in dark Havana bars
Mambo's slow Guantanamo
Was so glad, escape in Trinidad
Outside, down in Kingston town
Stole a car in the streets of Panama
Went too far in Bogota

Space cake brake at the Titicaca lake
Got some more in Ecuador
Out for a dance in a dive in Puerto Prince
Went too far in Bogota
A little weak, a little pale today
Looks like it's time for that certain holiday
A little weak, a little pale today
A little weak, a little pale today
You might also like
Rip 'em up

Space cake brake on the Titicaca lake
Got some more in Ecuador
Stole a car in the streets of Panama
Went too far in Bogota
A little weak, a little pale today
Looks like it's time for that certain holiday
A little weak, a little pale today
Looks like it's time
A little weak, a little pale today
A little weak, a little pale today
Looks like it's time for that certain holidayEmbed
