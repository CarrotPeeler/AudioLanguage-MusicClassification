Once in a while you'd be better listening to the fools for a change
I can see it in your eyes, it's the ones not like you you despise
I'm no different than you, it's just that I do whatever I want to
That's what sets us apart, I was free from the start, now you're leaving
Tell me whose heart is bleeding

So once in awhile you'd be better listening to the fools for a change

What comes around follows and the truth becomes harder to swallow
So bang bang they shoot you down, no one says a word as your body hits the ground
Oh pick her up and put her down the crowd screams aloud "She's not breathing!"
And the only hand that reaches is the one alone you've been cheating my friend
Tell me whose heart is bleeding again

So once in a while you'd be better listening to the fools for a change

Oh, once in a while you'd be better listening to the foolsYou might also likeEmbed
