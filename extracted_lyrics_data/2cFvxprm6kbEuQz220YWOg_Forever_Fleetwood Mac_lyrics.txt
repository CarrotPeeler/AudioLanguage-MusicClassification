6 ContributorsForever Lyrics
I like the way the light falls today
Slow, too lazy for anything
And I see boats that are sailing past me
You know
I wish this day could keep on going and last forever

(Forever and ever and ever and ever)
That's what I feel
(Forever and ever and ever and ever)
That's what I feel
(Forever and ever and ever and ever)
(Forever)

You know I like the way the light falls today
Slow, too lazy for anything
And I see boats that keep sailing past (But not too fast)
You know what?
I wish this day could keep on going and last forever

(Forever and ever and ever and ever)
(Forever and ever and ever and ever)
(Forever and ever and ever and ever)
Mmm, that's the way I feel
(Forever)

Don't fool around
Please don't fool with my happiness
Please don't fool around with my happiness
Don't fool with my happiness
You know I like the way light falls today
But please, please, please
Just let me stay that way
Too lazy, too lazy for anythingEmbed
