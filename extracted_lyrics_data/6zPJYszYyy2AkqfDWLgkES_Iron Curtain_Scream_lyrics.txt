1 ContributorWe Still Believe LyricsI'm a man of sorrows, acquainted with grief
When newborns die and blood fills our streets
And storms take lives
And hollywood says lies
And children cry
But I still believe
You can wash our streets
Set the captives free
And heal the leper lame
Whoa
And I won't stop
Calling on your name
Oh,oh, oh Call the broken ones
With all that they have lost
And all that they have seen
And all of those who mourn
And all of those who grieve
Tonight
Tonight's the night it rains red
Tonight
Tonight's the night it rains red
A dark and iron curtain screams things will never change
And a cross on a hill screams won't be the same
A kingdom is at hand and the rain will come again
As centuries past
But I still believe
You can wash our streets
Set the captives free
And heal the leper lame
Whoa
And I won't stop
Calling on your name
Oh,oh, oh Call the broken ones
With all that they have lost
And all that they have seen
And all of those who mourn
And all of those who grieve
Tonight
Tonight's the night it rains red
Tonight
Tonight's the night it rains red
In the desert, there's no clouds
Will the friendless, find a friend?
The skies can't hold back
The rain from heaven
These red stains will be washed white by red
Oh,oh, oh Call the broken ones
With all that they have lost
And all that they have seen
And all of those who mourn
And all of those who grieve
Tonight
Tonight's the night it rains red
Tonight
Tonight's the night it rains redYou might also likeEmbed
