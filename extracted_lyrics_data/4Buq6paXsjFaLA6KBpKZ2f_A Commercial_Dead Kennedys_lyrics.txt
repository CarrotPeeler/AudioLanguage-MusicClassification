Have we got a telethon for you
Coming soon on MTV
A rockin' bankroll extravaganza
Featuring all your vigilante rock stars:
Sammy Hagar (Yay!)
Sylvester Stallone
Clint Eastwood
This telethon is so important
We've even exhumed the bodies of Lynyrd Skynyrd (Wow!)
This ain't no sissy concert
To raise food for the needy
This concert's whipped up the American way
To raise money for guns for the greedy
So, stay tuned and dig in those heels
For USA for South Africa
It's USA for South Africa
'Cause those poor, sex-starved
Apartheid riot battalions
Need more machine guns
More tear gas, more nerve gas
And more electric fences
For those prison camps
They call "homelands"
You might also likeAnd who's going to give it to them?
We are! Every one of us
Every time we go to the bank
Every time we buy food at Theftway
Or those fancy chrome wheels
For your hot car
It's USA for South Ffrica!
Don't delay! Apartheid is a big business!
What would those American ladies do
Without those diamonds?
You have heard the White House... Don't miss it!
Have your rich parents' money ready
World hunger's gone forever
Once your check's in the mail
When MTV and the rock-and-racism connection
Bring you live, from Sun City
USA for South Africa!Embed
