All the World Nations, looking for the perfect beat
Mighty Zulu Nation, they have found the perfect beat
I’m Afrika Bambaataa, I possess the perfect beat
Beat, beat, beat, beat
Looking for the perfect beat (searching for the perfect beat)
Looking for the perfect beat (seeking for the perfect beat)
I must get mine (I'm out to get it)
I must get mine (I'm out to get it)
Now in this world of music, there are many different tones (tell 'em)
If there's no satisfaction, just take cause of action (listen out, listen out)
On your radio, you hear perfect beats playing (hey!)
If it makes you satisfied, just get up a pony and ride (giddy up!)
Well if you're looking for the perfect beat, people
Well here's a perfect beat for ya
Soulsonic’s main theme, with a chorus you can sing, round up!
Looking for the perfect beat (searching for the perfect beat)
Looking for the perfect beat (seeking for the perfect beat)
I must get mine (I'm out to get it)
I must get mine (I'm out to get it)
Looking for the perfect beat
Looking for the perfect beat
Looking for the perfect beat
Looking for the perfect beat
Say we like the body rockin' parties
Say we like the body rockin' parties
You like the body rockin' parties?
We like the MC poppin' parties
You might also likeStudents, of the music, at every single age
Must exercise the quotes of Shakespeare, with this life upon a stage
When we say life you know that's right, has a meaning
Our music keeps on pleasing
And all the things that we wanna keep teasin’, teasin’, teasin’, teasin’
Looking for the perfect beat, people
Well here's a perfect beat for ya
Looking for the perfect beat
Looking for the perfect beat
Looking for the perfect beat
Looking for the perfect beat
Looking for the perfect beat vibe, the one with the top sure shot mix
Stop a futuristic hit dance, just party (get loose, get loose)
Every time we get into it, it makes us speed our heartbeat
Brings out the very best in us, that is for real
Now this is what you gotta do (this is what you gotta do)
This is a thing you must to, round up!
Music is a must, as the rhythm moves the women
To a spacy romantic ocean that shows they’re high potent
At the spur of every moment there’s a space at your parade
With the psychadelic shades to make you party harty everybody
Now this is what you gotta do (this is what you gotta do)
This is a thing you must to, round up!
Mr. Biggs (looking for the perfect beat)
Now Pow Wow (looking for the perfect beat)
The G.L.O.B.E. (now has found the perfect beat)
People of the world (we're looking for the perfect beat)
All the boys and girls (looking for the perfect beat)
The Soul Sonic Force (have found the perfect beat)
Beat this!
Beat this!
Beat this!
Looking for the perfect beat, people
Well here's a perfect beat for ya
Soulsonic’s main theme, with a chorus you can sing, round up!
Looking for the perfect beat
Looking for the perfect beat
Looking for the perfect beat
Looking for the perfect beat
Get up on this rhyme, or you'll be left behind
Now say, say, say round up! (round up!)
Say round up (round up)
Say get the beat (get the beat)
The perfect beat (the perfect beat)
I gotta get mine (I gotta get mine)
I gotta get mine (I gotta get mine)
It's workin’ (It's workin’)
It’s workin’ (It’s workin’)
Say we like the body rockin' parties

You like the body rockin' parties?
We like the MC poppin' parties
Looking, looking, looking, Soulsonic Force
