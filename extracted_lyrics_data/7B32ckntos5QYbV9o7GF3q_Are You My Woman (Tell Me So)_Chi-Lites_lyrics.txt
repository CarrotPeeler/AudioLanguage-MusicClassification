6 ContributorsAre You My Woman? (Tell Me So) Lyrics
Seems to be a misunderstanding 'bout who you belong to
I'm tired of he-say, she-say and who shot John
I don't know where he came from, but he better go back where he's been
'Cause I don't want my heart broken, don't wanna commit no sin

'Cause I'm so, so tired, oh, you set my soul on fire
I'm so tired, well, you set my soul on fire

Are you my woman? Tell me so
Are you my woman? Tell me so
Well, are you my woman? Tell me so
Well, if you're not my woman, let me go (Just get on down)

Don't you know that I'll never be the same, no
'Cause you know that my life is in your name
Girl, I really, really hate to lose you
I just got to keep on moving

'Cause I'm so tired, because you set my soul on fire
I'm so tired, well, you set my soul on fire

Are you my woman? Tell me so
Well, are you my woman? Tell me so2Embed
