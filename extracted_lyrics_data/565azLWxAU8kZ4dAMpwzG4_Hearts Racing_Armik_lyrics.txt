I'm finally vicious, why do you not get it
Pretend that you hate me but you will regret it
These records i'm settin, the bar I just set it
If you try to exceed it , you will be headed
Bad to the bone, these rappers don’t know
I'm not even known, i'm taking the throne
Crash with your bitch, in your own home
Match all your flows, when im not in my zone
Chasin' paper like W.B Mason
Im a sick artist, but hommie I ain't tracin'
Im only being blunt like the one that im facin'
Smokin' on that good good, now my hearts racin'
Can't trust no hoes these days, signs can be misleadin'
They stab you in your back then they ask you why you bleedin'
Stick my dick up her ass, these bitches ain't conceiving
See me in my whip, boy I bet you'll catch me speedin'
My life's like a movie, full of actors in this bitch
But I rip those pages out,  and throw em down the ditch
You might not think so, but it easy getting rich
I'm getting money so fast like im throwin' a pitch

Money to the ceilin'
I just made a million
Hoes catching feelings but I ain't feel like dealin'
Ballin' like a Bull
Damn my pockets full
You only getting money cuz yo bitch is on my pole
You might also like
Finally Vicious, Finally Vicious, Finally Vicious
Finally Vicious, Finally Vicious, Finally Vicious
Finally Vicious, Finally Vicious, Finally Vicious
Finally Vicious, Finally Vicious, Finally Vicious

BBP balllin' and i'm just getting started
If you think my rhymes dumb, then you must be retarded
I'm hittin' these targets, like I just darted
Runnin' full speed, no energy is regarded
Call me the flash cause I dash past the faint hearted
Use my hulk smash to bash against logic
I am white rapper with skills, you can't stop it
If you hear me rap you'll know i'm a prospect
I am the prophet, the prophecy for this project
The cash is nice but I really don't want it
This show isn't over but I already won it
Yall at the bottom and i'm at the summit
Pussy is erotic, this bitch is exotic
Time is money but you know I don’t clock in
I relax in the tropics, poppin' narcotics
Almost everyday, you can call it periodic

They used to say, I was coming to weak
So I became a beast, known on the streets
Forget bout the heat, Droza light up the east
I spit holy water, you should call me a priest
You remind me of a slitherin' snake, brothas be fake
We do it mob-style, put a kiss on your face
You'll be sleepin' with the fishes in a river or lake
Treat your bars like a Kit Kat and give em break
Coming at me was a bad mistake
Man, you and me, we do not equate
Theres no debate, you I can take
So many shots you'll call me Steve Blake
Boy your hand i never will shake
I'm the head of this game and your just a flake
Pushin' these trees like my arm is a rake
Put your armies away, don’t be afraid

Finally Vicious, Finally Vicious, Finally ViciousEmbed
