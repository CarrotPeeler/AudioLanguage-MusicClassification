Breathe, oh breathe, now smother me, so
Clever me, I'm onto you
My, oh, my, now testify, I'm
Guilty by my clouds on you
Where you been? How far'd you get?
I got this sin I saved for you
I don't need your remedy, I
Wanna be right, sick of you

Sweet as torture, at least we were alive
Cringe and burn, but mark my words, so

Save your breath, save your breath
Save your breath, 'cause it's mine
Save your breath, save your breath
Save your breath, 'cause it's mine

Open wide, my crucify, I
Wanna ride my lungs on you
Nervous we, oh, jealousy, it's
Gonna be their debt to you
Bang! Bang! Bang!
Ain't no time!
Bang! Bang! Bang!
Ain't no time!
You might also like
Sweet as torture, at least we were alive
Cringe and burns, but mark my words, so

Save your breath, save your breath
Save your breath, 'cause it's mine
Save your breath, save your breath
Save your breath, 'cause it's mine
Nice!


Bang! Bang! Bang!
Ain't no time!
Bang! Bang! Bang!
Ain't no time!

Sweet as torture, now mark my words and

Save your breath, save your breath
Save your breath, 'cause it's mine
Save your breath, save your breath
Save your breath, 'cause it's mine
Save your breath, save your breath
Save your breath, 'cause it's mine
Nice!1Embed
