1 ContributorCandy Paint Lyrics
I don't fuckin' like talking about this shit, for real
Fuck
Alright, there's some shit that happened last year, I haven't told too many people about
And, I don't do that good with explaining shit to people so, I guess I've gotta fuckin' rap it
Fuck it
Yea

Winter time’s the hardest anyways, I need a great escape
Maybe this lil piece of lead can take me to a better place
They got me on all these fuckin’ meds, and plus I like to drink
They told me this lexapro would fix fuckin’ fucked up brain
Better sober up before I lose it, fuckin’ go insane
Wouldn’t wanna do some shit that I’d regret, I better think
Lookin’ at this white couch, wonder how it would fuckin’ stained
Don’t want her to leave, but I told her I could fuckin’ change
Alcohol can’t do it, hope these bullets help me ease the pain
Sit down on the couch, can’t give myself the time to fuckin’ think
Homies step in puddles of the shit that was just in my veins
The typa shit that look like candy paint
I’m an atheist, my family ain’t
Shoulda known I couldn’t be a saint
I been privileged, though, I can’t complain
I’m pourin’ shit that look like purple rain
You might also like
I don’t wanna hurt you, but this anxiety’s so tough
I swore I won’t desert you, but just lovin’ you is not enough
I don’t know why I’m so sad, prolly ‘cause I’m on a lot of drugs
It feels like I’m down bad, right as I was comin’ up

Why am I so fucked up, couldn’t even call you up
That shit wasn’t lettin’ up
Fall, but then I’m gettin’ up

Winter time’s the hardest anyways, I need a great escape
Plus I’m fat as fuck, nobody likes me, need to get in shape
White kid tryna rap, I sucked, I guess I need to know my place
Didn’t want my girlfriend to be sad, so I pushed  her away
I was ‘bouta do it, cocked the pistol, pointed it my way
You think about a lot of shit when you about to blow your brain
Cryin’ out for help, I think my mother thought I’d gone insane
The night before I did it, told my bitch that I just needed space
Wanted her to hate me when I did it, at the time I wanted God to take me, I admit it
Hoped angels would pull up to give me safety when I’m finished
I’m glad I didn’t do it, tho, I think I found repentance
The shit I thought was pressin’ me at the time is gone
I was fuckin’ up like I ain’t know right from wrong
They said I needed therapy, I put it in a song
Now they playin’ it and I think that it’s catchin’ on
I don’t wanna hurt you, but this anxiety’s so tough
I swore I won’t desert you, but just lovin’ you is not enough
I don’t know why I’m so sad, prolly ‘cause I’m on a lot of drugs
It feels like I’m down bad, right as I was comin’ up

Why am I so fucked up, couldn’t even call you up
That shit wasn’t lettin’ up
Fall, but then I’m gettin’ upEmbed
