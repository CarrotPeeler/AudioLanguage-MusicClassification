5 ContributorsModern Day Delilah Lyrics
Yeah, yeah
I still remember when I saw your face across the room
Told me to take you but the price of love would seal my doom

I know the way you made the others break
But loving me would be your first mistake

Same old way, same old ways
Modern Day Delilah
Each time you learn to give
Queen to slave
Modern Day Delilah

Listen
You lived your glory in a liars haze you called the truth
The same old story of a social plan from wasted youth

You thought that you could bring me to my knees
But who's the one who's crying baby please

Same old way, same old ways
Modern Day Delilah
Each time you learn to give
Queen to slave
Modern Day Delilah
You might also like
Hey
Just like the trigger of a loaded gun
You were the reason for the damage done
Too many lovers like a hunter's prey
Not today

I know the way you made the others break
But loving me would be your last mistake
Each time you learn to give

Same old way
Modern Day Delilah
Shame, shame, shame, on you girls
Queen to slave
Modern Day Delilah

Yeah, yeah, each time you learn to give
Same old ways, same old ways
Modern Day Delilah
Queen to slave, loves decayed
