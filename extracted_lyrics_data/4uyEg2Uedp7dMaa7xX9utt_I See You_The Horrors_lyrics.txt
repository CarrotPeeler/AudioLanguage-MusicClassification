3 ContributorsI See You Lyrics
Through the summer, you can breathe the air
Rest forever cause there's nothing else
See the way the valley starts to grow
Every movement seems to be for you

I can see your future in it
I can see it there
I can see your future in it
I can see it there
I see you
I see you
I see you
I see you
And all the things you might do
All the things you might do
All the things you might do
I see you
I see you

Through the summer, you will soon forget
Days get longer but the sun still sets
You're so fair while love is yours to choose
Life is fragile, don't you let it go

I can see your future in it
I can see it there
I can see your future in it
I can see it there
I see you
I see you
I see you
I see you
And all the things you might do
All the things you might do
All the things you might do
I see you
I see youEmbed
