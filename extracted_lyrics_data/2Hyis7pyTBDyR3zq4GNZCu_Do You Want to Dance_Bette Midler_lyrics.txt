7 ContributorsDo You Want to Dance? LyricsDo you wanna dance, and hold my hand?
Tell me you're my lover man
Oh baby, do you wanna dance?
(Dance, dance)
We could dance under the moonlight
Hug and kiss all through the night
Oh baby (Baby), tell me, do you wanna dance with me, baby?

Do you (Do you), do you, do you (Do you), do you want to dance?
Do you (Do you), do you (Do you), do you want to dance?
Do you (Do you), do you, do you (Do you), do you want to dance with me, baby?
Ah, that's right, ah, ah, ah
Do you wanna dance (Do you?) under the moonlight?
Hug me, kiss me, baby (Do you?), all through the night
Oh baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby (Baby)
Tell me, do you wanna dance?
Whoa-oh, do you (Do you), do you, do you (Want to groove)
