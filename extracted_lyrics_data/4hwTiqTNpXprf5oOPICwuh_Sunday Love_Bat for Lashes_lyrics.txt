14 ContributorsSunday Love Lyrics
See her in blue eyes, numb and shining
In the face of strangers in the city lights
Grey is climbing, Cupid's diving
And I know that she's come to spend the night

I see her in every place I go
Sunday love is so cold
Even though I'm falling apart
I want Sunday love in my heart

See her in blue eyes, still and shining
In lonely lovers on bed sheets white
Grey shapes sliding, I've been pining
She's in my bedroom, now I can't fight

I see her in every place I go
Sunday love is so cold
Even though I'm falling apart
I want Sunday love in my heart

I see her in every place I go
Sunday love is so cold
Even though I'm falling apart
I want Sunday love in my heart
You might also like

I see her in every place I go
Sunday love is so cold
Even though I'm falling apart
I want Sunday love in my heartEmbed
