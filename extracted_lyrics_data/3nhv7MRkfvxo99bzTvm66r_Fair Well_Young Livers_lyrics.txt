1 ContributorFair Well LyricsI wish these were the first words that I heard
"Welcome in dear stranger,"
But the red ran fast of their hands
Slight of hand receive/emit the coarse
And timely candor
With forked tongues and unkind eyes
It wastes in smiles
Wrapped in tooth and fang
Designed deception
Hanging like the lit neon signs
Have we all come unhinged
Faceless apathetic
I thought once we were as one
But now
Most seems focused on the aesthetics
Wrought with indecision. Iron lines draw a hard division
We are not alone
We are not alone
Raise up fall fast once more around
We are not alone
We are not alone
Raise up fall fast once more around
We are not alone
We are not aloneYou might also likeEmbed
