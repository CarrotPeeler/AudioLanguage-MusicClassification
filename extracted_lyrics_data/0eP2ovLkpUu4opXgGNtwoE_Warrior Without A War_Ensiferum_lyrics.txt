6 ContributorsWarrior Without a War LyricsOnly change is unavoidable
A brave new chapter is getting closer
Without a shroud of doubt he walked
The road, so long, one dream, now gone
What are you more afraid to find
Something to live or something to die for?
In the end, how will you fall?
As a hero or a warrior without a war?
Why you withhold the pain but need those scars?
How will you leave to the unknown shores?
As a hero of a warrior without a war?
The one who is now forgotten
Carries the weight of a mountain
No one can see how solemn
Is the burden of the fallen
Memories, ruthless like old guilt
Choices, accept or be haunted
No past, no future means a thing
The very moment is all there is
What are you more afraid to find
Something to live or something to die for?
In the end, how will you fall?
As a hero or a warrior without a war?

How will you face your final dawn?
As a hero or a warrior without a war?
The one who is now forgotten
Carries the weight of a mountain
No one can see how solemn
Is the burden of the fallenEmbed
