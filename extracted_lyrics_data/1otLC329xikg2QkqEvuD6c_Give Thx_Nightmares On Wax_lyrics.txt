Thank you father for all the love you give
Guide me gently when my light falls dim
Thank you mother
Powers from within
Through each day all the thanks that i'm giving
Thank you fother for all the love you give
Guide me gently when my light fall dim
Thank you mother power from within
Through each day all the thanks that I give
Ahh oh

Ahh ohhh
Thank you father for all the love you give
Guide me gently when my light falls dim
Thank you mother for the power from within
Through each day all the thanks that i'm giving
When my light grows dim
And the darkness comes
