Hey you, I've seen your face before
It's you in the picture
Which hangs on my bedroom wall
Is it true, all of those things
That they say about you?
So tell me, tell me, tell me
What am I supposed to do?

In the name of love, yeah
In the name of love
In the name of love, yeah
In the name of love

Well, it's fun to think that
I'm having the time of my life
And it's true, if all this around us
Is paradise (Paradise, paradise, paradise)
But now, I want to be left here
With nothing at all
Even the picture has fallen away
From the bedroom wall

In the name of love, yeah
In the name of love
In the name of love, yeah
In the name of love
