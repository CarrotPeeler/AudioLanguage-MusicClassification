2 ContributorsBenevolence LyricsVerse 1:
He got to much arrogance
He ain’t even got no relevance
Girl you know he’s incompetent
He don’t deserve your benevolence
The way you look at him is evident
Let me marvel at your excellence
Cause’ you lookin’ fine and elegant
Beautiful, amassing and eloquent
Amazing, clever and intelligent
Your playin’ with my heart like am experiment
My heart‘s in bits like a sediment
You can hang me like an ornament
Your pullin’ my strings like an instrument
I don’t care if my songs sound all dissonant
The melody of our story is so consonant
Over my heart yeah your always dominant
Chorus (x2):
Cause’ everything can change
You know I’m playing your game
All this is driving me insane
Let us share our pain
You might also likeOh all these twisted game
I wanna play again
Girl let me hold you hand
You can share my name
Verse 2:
Let me just start with this preface
My tears were pretty obvious
Not being with you is my weakness
You always left me speechless
Of him I was always jealous
With out you I feel so helpless
Theses days seem endless
I hope you were here to see this
Why’d I have to be so jealous
I was always so reckless
If you got hurt he couldn’t care less
But If you did I’d be stressed
Bridge:
My reputation proceeds me
In this game I am knee deep
But I don’t wanna be needy
All theses rumours I can’t see
Of my feet you just sweep me
But I don’t just wanna be
The guy don’t wanna see
I don’t want you hatin’ me
Chorus (x2):
Cause’ everything can change
You know I’m playing your game
All this is driving me insane
Let us share our pain
Oh all these twisted game
I wanna play again
Girl let me hold you hand
You can share my name
Outro:
Don’t want this game to ends
Wish we could make amends
It’s just the same old trend
I’m always just your friendEmbed
