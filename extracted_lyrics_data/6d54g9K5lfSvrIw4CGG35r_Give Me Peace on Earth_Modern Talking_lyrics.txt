6 ContributorsGive Me Peace on Earth Lyrics
Love is easy, hate is wrong
Find the way babe, way back home
Give your heart, love never die
Oh, a little cloud will cry
Be a dreamer, be a fool
Come and break all these rules
Better late than never done
For the children we need a home

Give me peace on earth
Give me all your love
Say, that we want fighting
For the peace of all
Give me peace on earth
(Let the children sing)
Give me all your love
(Give me all your love)
For the little children
For the peace of all

Come together, turn a dream
For the children, love's all we need
All the wrongs don't make it right
For the children we will fight
You might also like
Give me peace on earth
Give me all your love
Say, that we want fighting
For the peace of all
Give me peace on earth
(Let the children sing)
Give me, give  me all your love
(Give me all your love)
For, for the little children
For the peace of all
Give me peace on earth
(Let the children sing)
Give , give  me all your love
(Give me all your love)
Say, that we want fighting
For the peace of allEmbed
