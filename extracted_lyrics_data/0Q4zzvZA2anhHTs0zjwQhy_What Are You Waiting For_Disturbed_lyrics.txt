13 ContributorsWhat Are You Waiting For Lyrics
(So, what you waiting for?
So, what you waiting for?)

I have never compromised
I never gave in
And so, I have welcomed
Every challenge in my life
And I have never wandered blind
I'm led by hunger and so I
Savor every drop
Each minute I'm alive

Leave nothing left behind

So, what you waiting for?
Tell me, what you waiting for?
Don't stand by and deny it
So, what you waiting for?
Tell me, what you waiting for?
Break new ground and defy it
Don't let the world outside
Leave you cornered and alone
So, what you waiting for?
Tell me, what you waiting for?
Let them all be reminded

Don't let them undermine
Your dreams can never be stolen
Don't leave them stagnant
Rotting on the vine
Say goodbye
To anyone who tries
To bleed you dry
You will show them
You're blessed
With an unlimited supply

Leave nothing left behind

So, what you waiting for?
Tell me, what you waiting for?
Don't stand by and deny it
So, what you waiting for?
Tell me, what you waiting for?
Break new ground and defy it
Don't let the world outside
Leave you cornered and alone
So, what you waiting for?
Tell me, what you waiting for?
Let them all be reminded
(So, what you waiting for?)

So, what you waiting for?
Tell me, what you waiting for?
Don't stand by and deny it
So, what you waiting for?
Tell me, what you waiting for?
Break new ground and defy it
Don't let the world outside
Leave you cornered and alone
So, what you waiting for?
Tell me, what you waiting for?
Let them all be reminded

So, what you waiting for?
So, what you waiting for?1Embed
