20 ContributorsThat’s Why You’re Beautiful Lyrics
Diamonds used to be coal
Look young 'cause they got soul
That's why they're beautiful
And my heart used to be cold
'Til your hands laid on my soul
Baby, and that's why you're beautiful

I'm not wonderin' why the sky's blue
That's not my business
All I know is I look up and tell myself
"Be patient, love, that could be us"

Lovers used to make love
And die just to give us
Their piece of the beautiful
Remember when we made love?
Love
Wasn't it beautiful?

Don't ask me why the sky's blue
That's not my business
All I know is I look up and tell myself
"Be patient, love (Be patient, love)
That could be us" (That could be us)

Diamonds used to be coal (Be coal)
Look young 'cause they got soul (Got soul)
And my heart used to be cold (Be cold)
'Til your hands laid on my soul (My soul)
Somebody's got to stay deep in love
That could be us
That's why we're beautiful (Ooh)
That's why you're beautiful
Ooh, ooh, oh

Why, why?
Oh (Oh)
Why, why?
Why, why?
That's why you're beautiful
That's why you're beautiful
That's why you're beautiful6Embed
