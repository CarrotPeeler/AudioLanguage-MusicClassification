1 ContributorMercenary Man LyricsGive him a gun and he'll fight your battles
Give him the money and he'll fight the world
He doesn't think twice about you or me
And one or two more and he'll kill for free
Mercenary man
You better get it while you can
'Cause you ain't necessary, mercenary man
Mercenary man, mercenary man
You better get it while you can
'Cause you ain't necessary, mercenary man
With your motor cars and color TV's
You earn your living without a degree
With money in your pockеts and blood on your hands
And what do you do about the tax man
Mercenary man
You bеtter get it while you can
'Cause you ain't necessary, mercenary man
Mercenary man, mercenary man
You better get it while you can
'Cause you ain't necessary, mercenary man
Mercenary man
You better get it while you can
'Cause you ain't necessary, mercenary man
Mercenary man, mercenary man
You better get it while you can
'Cause you ain't necessary, mercenary man

You better get it while you canEmbed
