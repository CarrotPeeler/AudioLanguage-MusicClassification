1 ContributorCandy Darling Lyrics

Fell in love with herself
Couldn't really fall for anyone else
Now I can't that I blame her
No, I won't say that I blame her
For taking just one more look

But the saddest thing, I have to say it
There's no one that can ever stay so strong
And that is why she had to die
Candy darling, so long
Candy darling, so long
