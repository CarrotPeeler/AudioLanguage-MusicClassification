Alright
This is the last one

Oh
Who are the bands, where are the bands
Who's able to make believe?
Go with the gang, hiding the slang
Spreading the old disease

You look the same
Yeah, you all look the same
You look the same
Yeah, you all look the same
You look the same
Yeah, you all look the same

My revelation
My revelation
My revelation

You've got the face, baby
I've got the taste
 taste, taste, taste, taste
The feeling is good and healthy
I know you could attract me
Instead you attacked me, I'm trapped in a taxi
No-oh
You might also like
My revelation
My revelation
My revelation
My revelation
My revelation
My revelation
My revelation
My revelation

Who are the bands, where are the bands
Who's able to make believe?
Go with the gang, hiding the slang
Spreading the old disease

You look the same
Yeah, you all look the same
You look the same
Yeah, you all look the same
You look the same
Yeah, you all look the same
You look the same
Yeah, you all look the sameEmbed
