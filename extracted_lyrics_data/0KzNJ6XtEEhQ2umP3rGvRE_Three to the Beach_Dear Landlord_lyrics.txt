2 ContributorsThree To The Beach LyricsNot tonight, don't make that awful sound
It's dragging me farther down
Taking out all the fight, holding me to the ground
Making my enemies proud, and what gives you the right?
We're not that hopeless, we're not as fucked as you think
In short lived moments we can do anything
The fucking joke is we're winning when you blink
In short lived moments lousy with victory
We're both sort of right, I don't have much to show
I'll die penniless, alone
I'll do what I like and you'll do what you know
Never hungry, broke or cold, it's the weight of things I suppose
It's really just the passing of these days that's gonna leave us all set in our ways
We don't have to take that lying down
And I'd be lying if I didn't say that it's been getting harder to relate
And keep myself from drowning in the crowd
And I still believe that we're not that hopeless, we're not as fucked as you think
In short lived moments we can do anything
The fucking joke is we're winning when you blink
In short lived moments lousy with victory
We're not that hopeless, we're not as fucked as you think
In short lived moments we can do anything
The fucking joke is we're winning when you blink
In short lived moments lousy with victory
