I won't pretend that I intend to stop living
I won't pretend I'm good at forgiving
But I can't hate you
Though I have tried
Ah, ah

I still really really love you
Love is stronger than pride
I still really really love you
Hmm, mmm

I won't pretend that I intend to stop living
I won't pretend I'm good at forgiving
But I can't hate you
Although I have tried
Mmm, ah

I still really really love you
Love is stronger than pride
I still really really love you
Mmm, mmm, mmm

Sitting here wasting my time
Would be like waiting for the sun to rise
It's all too clear things come and go
Sitting here waiting for you
Would be like waiting for winter
It's gonna be cold, there may even be snow

I still really really love you
Love is stronger than pride
I still really really love you
Love is stronger
I still really love you
Love is stronger than pride3Embed
