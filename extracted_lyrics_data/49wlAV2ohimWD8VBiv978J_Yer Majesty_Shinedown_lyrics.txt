10 ContributorsYer Majesty Lyrics
Come closer inside
There's something I need you to see
It's just a picture
Of what the ignorant believe
I've come so you can know me
I'm here to make you proud
I've come to wreck and guide you
I'm here to show you how

You know I'm coming for you
'Cause I got nothing to lose
And yeah I'm still on my way
For the pay

So you wanted to be free
From everything you've done to me
And you wanted to be known
So you wouldn't feel so alone
And you wanted to believe
That you still had integrity
And I'm sorry you're on your knees
But you can't blame me, your majesty

Let's take a moment
I need to spoil who you are
I played your game once
You sold me out with no regard
I've come so you can know me
I'm here to make you proud
I've come to wreck and guide you
I'm here to voice out loud

You know I'm coming for you
'Cause I got nothing to lose
And yeah I'm still on my way
For the pay

So you wanted to be free
From everything you've done to me
And you wanted to be known
So you wouldn't feel so alone
And you wanted to believe
That you still had integrity
And I'm sorry you're on your knees
But you can't blame me, your majesty
So you wanted to be free
From everything you've done to me
And you wanted to be known
So you wouldn't feel so alone
And you wanted to believe
That you still had integrity
And I'm sorry you're on your knees
But you can't blame me, your majestyEmbed
