1 ContributorBeauty Never Fades LyricsEach step I take the shadows grow longer
Padded footfalls in the dark I wander
Come to steal your lifeblood away
Looking for a beauty that never fades
See a glimpse inside the pool, it's hollow
Come to know a time when he will haunt you
Snapping at my heels made me live
Someone take me back to the angel realm, today
Each step I take the shadows grow longer
Padded footfalls in the dark I wander
Come to steal your lifeblood away
Looking for a beauty that never fades
See a glimpse inside the pool, it's hollow
Come to know a time when he will haunt you
Snapping at my heels made me live
Someone take me back to the angel realm, todayYou might also likeEmbed
