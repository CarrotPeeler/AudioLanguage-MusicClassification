8 ContributorsNaked Lyrics
I lie awake, hesitate, between love and hate
I know you've been feeling my infatuation
I can see, you and me, doing things we shouldn't be
I can't seem to stop my imagination

I can feel your eyes all over my body
I can read the signs, they're sexual
I can read your mind and I can see you want me
Something in your eyes so sensual

You make me feel naked
Undressing me with your eyes
You make me feel naked
Oh, hypnotized (Oh, hypnotized)
I feel naked, naked

In between you and me, there is sensuality
I can feel your eyes, I can feel the tension
Hurling me to the ground, turning me upside down
I could lose myself without redemption

I can feel your eyes all over my body
I can read the signs, they're sexual
I can read your mind and I can see you want me
Something in your eyes so sensual
You might also like
You make me feel naked
Undressing me with your eyes
You make me feel naked
Oh, hypnotized (Oh, hypnotized)
Naked, so naked

I feel your lips, your finger tips
Get inside, play with my mind
I feel myself begin to melt
Don't look at me, don't stop
(Chorus to fade)Embed
