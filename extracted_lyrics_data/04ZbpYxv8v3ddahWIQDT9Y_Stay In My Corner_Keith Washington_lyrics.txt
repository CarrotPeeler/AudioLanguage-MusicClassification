Take a look at me
Can’t you tell
That I’m alone without you in my life
Now I know for sure, this is love
My ole sweet love
You’ve been with me through thick and thin
You stood right here ‘till the end
And now I can say, you’re all that I need
No one knows what I’ve been through
I’ll give my all, I promise to
Forevermore
I’ll give you love

Stay in my corner
I won’t let us down
I need you around
Hold me close, never let me go
Stay
Stay in my corner

There’s been times I felt
Like givin’ up
But inside I knew that someday
It would all work out
“Keep thе faith”
My heart would say
You’ve been right herе through it all
And seldomly complained to me
I truly can say
There’s no better woman
And when it comes to lovin’ me
You give your all tenderly
What more
Can I ask for
You might also like
Stay in my corner
I won’t let us down
I need you around
Hold me close, never let me go
Stay
Stay in my corner
Stay in my corner
I won’t let us down
I need you around
Hold me close, never let me go
Stay
Stay in my corner

Don’t you know I need your love
And can’t you see that I’m
I’m so into you
By now you should know
My love grows and grows
More for everyday
Baby please
Say you’ll stay
‘Cause I love you
I won’t lie to you
No, no
Stay in my corner
I won’t let us down
I need you around
Hold me close, never let me go
Stay
Stay in my corner
Stay in my corner
I won’t let us down
I need you around
Hold me close, never let me go
Stay
Stay in my cornerEmbed
