6 ContributorsStar Lyrics
So they made you a star, now your head's in a cloud
Now you're walking down the street, with your feet off the ground

They read in the press, all about your success
They believe every word they've been told

After all you've been through, tell me what will you do
When you find yourself out in the cold?

Ah tell me
Ah tell me

When you appear on the stage, there's a standing ovation
You really live out your performance, you're the biggest sensation

You breeze through the door, and when you take the floor
You expect to have it all to yourself

After all you've been through, tell me what will you do
When you find yourself back on the shelf?
You might also like
Ah tell me
Ah tell me

You breeze through the door and when you take the floor
You expect to have it all to yourself

After all you've been through tell me what will you do
When you find yourself back on the shelf?

Ah tell me
Ah tell me
