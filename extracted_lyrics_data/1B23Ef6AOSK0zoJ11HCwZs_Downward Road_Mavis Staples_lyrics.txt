2 ContributorsDownward Road LyricsThe world out there is like a hornets' nest
It draws the life out of the good and feeds their blood to the rest
You'll be a memory soon baby, and so will I
So kiss me open-mouthed, 'cause we're too young to die

We're on the downroad road
We're on the downroad road
We're on the downroad road
Crawling towareds the bitter end
Things are going fine now, but your luck could change
You could find yourself the victim of someone's unholy rage
So put your pretty lips where they can do some good
You might think that you shouldn't
But I really wish you would

Yeah we're so close now, I'm in as deep as I'll get
Your hair is soaked, your skin is slippery wet
The world outside our window is about to explode
Well, so am I sugar, so baby save my soul
