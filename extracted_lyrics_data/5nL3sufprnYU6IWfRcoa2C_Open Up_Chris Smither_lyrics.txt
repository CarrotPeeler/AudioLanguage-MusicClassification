1 ContributorBe On Lyrics
I ain't tryna be known
I'm just tryna be on
I'm barely ever at home
Money always on my phone
I ain't tryna be known
I'm just tryna be on
Foreign cars parked it all on my home

I ain't tryna be known
I'm just tryna be on
I'm barely ever at home
Money always on my phone
I ain't tryna be known
I'm just tryna be on
Foreign cars parked it all on my home
Pulled up, and whole roof gone
I ain't tryna be known...

Working on the vision, tryna make it what I planned for
This is all I need, really I cannot demand more
So much fucking money, make me question what I stand for
Started from the bottom, and you know I'm finna transport
Going up to the top though
Hating me cause I got dough
I'ma be on movie sets
I ain't giving you props though
Taking shots like the cops though
Fans be loving my hot flow
Now they saying I direct the streets
I ain't never gonna stop though
Greenlight my checks fam
My looks sharper than X-Man
Got the money in the right hands
Got ya girl in my left hand
Life's great, man things change
One day, I'ma see fame
Buying drinks like T-Pain
Love my squad up in GA
Chris Smith and Brett too
Wesley, that best crew
Wassup Rob, shouts to Josh
Many more that I'm next to
I'm love ya'll, I'm going up
TNT, I'm blowing up
I'm winning now, it's such a blast
Many chances finna open up
You might also like
I ain't tryna be known
I'm just tryna be on
I'm barely ever at home
Money always on my phone
I ain't tryna be known
I'm just tryna be on
Foreign cars parked it all on my home
Pulled up, and whole roof gone
I ain't tryna be known...

Say that I can't rap, but I'm busting in the cyphers though
Said I couldn't do it, so I hit 'em with the finer flows
Hating on me now cause I'm decked out in designer clothes
Hanging with the legends, yeah I guess I had to find them ropes
Run this game nonstop
Like K.Dot, I'm the Top Dawg
Yeah I got them major keys
But got my future on lock
Everybody tryna pop off
Undefeated, no socks off
Spitting flames on all these hoes
They crackling like some pop rocks
Got dreams, I do though
Fight for this like sumo
Nothing is M-Possible, that made stacks, so kudos
Yeah
She said that it's real
So I hit that bitch up, for a Netflix and Chill
I got goals ahead that I'm straining for
Got purchases that I'm saving for
But ya'll wouldn't even say hey to me
So what the fuck am I waving for?
Made some cash, I'm craving more
Hot tracks, creating more
Told Sam we gon' get this shit
He told me what am I waiting for?
I ain't tryna be known
I'm just tryna be on
I'm barely ever at home
Money always on my phone
I ain't tryna be known
I'm just tryna be on
Foreign cars parked it all on my home
Pulled up, and whole roof gone
I ain't tryna be known...

I ain't tryna be known
I'm just tryna be on
I'm barely ever at home
Money always on my phone
I ain't tryna be known
I'm just tryna be on
Foreign cars parked it all on my home
Pulled up, and whole roof gone
I ain't tryna be...Embed
