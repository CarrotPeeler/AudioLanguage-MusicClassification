Stuck in the pits of Cape Coral
Really gave me the blues
Being stuck in one place too long
Makes me itchy to move

There's gotta be a better place, there's got to be
So let's get on the move

Let's go, let's go
Let's go, let's go
Let's go, let's go away

No matter where ever I go
It seems always the same
Got to find a new world
Before I start going insane

There's gotta be a better place, there's got to be
So let's get on the move

Let's go, let's go
Let's go, let's go
Let's go, let's go away
Let's go, let's go
Let's go, let's go
Let's go, let's go awayYou might also likeEmbed
