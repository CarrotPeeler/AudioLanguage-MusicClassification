Like all immortals, I will make my way
I've seen the riddles, and heard the songs
I am immortal, must I obey?
I can smell the fire, hear the hammers and the wheels
I can feel the fear inside of me
No birds are singing, no sound of the trees
The growing darkness all around me
Third immortal
The lord and the servant
Do I have to ride? there are others in need
Must I call the Lords of the Skies?
I know my heart, and I know my way
This is where the end shall begin
The greater light, shall I obey?
Like all immortals, I will make my way
I've seen the riddles, and heard the songs
I am immortal, must I obey?
Raining ashes, tears of doom
Dead leaves along the road
It is not a trick of the light
Crimson colors in the sky
You might also likeI could hide, I could run away
I am here for the cause
The great plan shall remain
For the reason I will stay
Third immortal
The lord and the servant
Spirit of the old
From the light of the ghost
I have been away for too long, but now I know
It is my time, I shall bow to the greater light
Like all immortals I made my way
I have been hiding all the powers
I am a servant I will obey
This will be my finest hour
This will be my finest hourEmbed
