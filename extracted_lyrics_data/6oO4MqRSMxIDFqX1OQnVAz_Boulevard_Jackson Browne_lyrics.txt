Down on the boulevard they take it hard
They look at life with such disregard
They say it can't be won
The way the game is run
But if you choose to stay
You wind up playing anyway
It's okay

You know the kids in shock up and down the block
Their folks are home playing beat the clock
Down at the Golden Cup
They set the young ones up
Under the neon light
Selling day for night
It's alright

Nobody rides for free (Nobody, nobody)
Nobody gets it like they want it to be (Nobody, nobody)
Nobody hands you any guarantee (Nobody, nobody)
Nobody baby
No, nobody baby

The hearts are hard and the times are tough
Down on the boulevard the night's enough
And time passes slow
Between the storefront shadows and the streetlights' glow
Everybody walks right by like they're safe or something
They don't know
You might also like
Nobody knows you (Nobody, nobody)
Nobody owes you nothin' (Nobody, nobody)
Nobody shows you what they're thinking (Nobody, nobody)
Nobody

Hey, hey, baby
Got to watch the street and keep your feet
And be on guard
Make it pay, baby
It's only time on the boulevard
It's like this
I mean it's the way it is (On the boulevard)
Yeah yeah yeah yeah baby (On the boulevard)
It's only time on the boulevard1Embed
