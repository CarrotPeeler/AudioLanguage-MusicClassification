3 ContributorsCowboy Junkies Lament LyricsBaby hit the back door breathin' real heavy
Said the boys in the alley wouldn't leave her alone
Mama did her make-up in a terrible hurry
She finally got ready, but the boys were gone
Mama, don't you worry, night's approachin'
There's a hole in heaven where some sin slips through
Just close your eyes and dream real steady
Maybe just a little will spill on you
Dark don't lie, dreams come true
Could be a few will see it through
Old lady Rose lookin' down her nose
At lonely Miss Lily hiding in the hall
Lily's just praying for the trial to be over
Lady Rose just waiting for the axe to fall
Show me off on the way to town
The sky's still shining and the earth's still brown
Tell the judge I'm ready for the vases
Gonna dance in their faces when the guitar sounds
Won't be long, I won't be gone
Been leaning toward the shadows all along
You might also likeThose in the know say so it goes
You plan on reapin', you better sow
You plan on sleepin', you better keep movin'
Sleepin' ain't allowed around here, you know
Tell me please when the rollin's over
Me and my baby gonna have some fun
Bury our backs in a bed of clover
Smile in style while the sun goes down
Snake eyes cry, boxcars sigh
Seven's stuck in the middle, just wonderin' why
Dark don't lie, dreams come true
All it takes is one or two
Maybe just a few will see you throughEmbed
