3 ContributorsSix Ways To Sunday LyricsI'm gonna love you six ways to Sunday
I wanna do it like it's never been done
I'm gonna love you six ways to Sunday
I wanna hear that woman speaking in tongue
Brother I've been back siding us a little too long
You think I know by now what's right and what's wrong
Living it up when the sky's ain't blue
Chasing my tail a couple other one's too
I'm gonna love you six ways to Sunday
I wanna do it like it's never been done
I'm gonna love you six ways to Sunday
I wanna hear my baby speaking in tongue
Honey I'll pick up mistakes and drink the straight line too
Long as I get a chance to lay my hands on you
I got my mind right, toeing the line
Look up and tell me does my halo shine
I'm gonna love you six ways to Sunday
I wanna do it like it's never been done
I'm gonna love you six ways to Sunday
I wanna hear that woman speaking in tongue
You knocked the angel right out off of my shoulder
Right away my little devil took over
Woman if you need a disciple
We can have a little revival
