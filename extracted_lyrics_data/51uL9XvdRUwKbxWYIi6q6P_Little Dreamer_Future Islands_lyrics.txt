I caught you sleeping here, all wrapped in wool
I caught you sleeping here, almost broke my heart
I found you dreaming
I'm dreaming of you always, always

When I was just a child, a lonely boy
I held onto my dreams, like they could run from me
The hopes I harbored fled - as they often do
But I still dreamed of you
And now my dream's come true


And as we say goodnight, I hold you close and tight
No more raging suns, only waning ones
Like the waxing scar where my lonely heart --
Once bloomed  -- before, I met you

My little dreamer, I'll always
Always, dream of you
My little dreamer, I'll always
Always, dream of youSee Future Islands LiveGet tickets as low as $139You might also like5Embed
