4 ContributorsMonkey Boogie Lyrics
A snake, a fake, he's lame, he's in this game
For the money and for the fame
A spin, a grin, he's on and then we yawn
Steals the credit then he is gone
He's the man with a plan and first he'll seem helpfull
To make sure that you're on the hook
He's so full of bull and he sure will pull
Some strings to make things go his way
And everything will go his way

(We're in the monkey biz)
The monkey boogie is nothing new
(The monkey biz)
And he'll be doin' the dance with you
(We're in the monkey biz)
Yeah the monkey boogie is nothing new
(The monkey biz)
And he'll be doin' that dance, doing that dance with you

Humble, mumble, stumble don't think so
That is not the way to go
Connect, collect, correct, now what did you expect?
Did you think that he seriously cares for you?
Do the monkey boogie, orangu-tango, baboon!

The monkey boogie is nothing new

And he'll be doin' the dance with you
(We're in the monkey biz)
Yeah the monkey boogie is nothing new
(The monkey biz)
And he'll be doin' that dance, doing that dance with you
Yeahaa!

(We're in the monkey biz)
The monkey boogie is nothing new
(The monkey biz)
And he'll be doin' the dance with you
(We're in the monkey biz)
Yeah the monkey boogie is nothing new
(The monkey biz)
And he'll be doin' that dance, doing that dance with you
(We're in the monkey biz)
The monkey boogie is a monkey-talking man
(The monkey biz)
And he'll be doin' that dance, doing that dance with you
