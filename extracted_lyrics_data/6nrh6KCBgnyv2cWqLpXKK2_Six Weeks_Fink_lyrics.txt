3 ContributorsSix Weeks LyricsSo much changes
And I know this in ages
Now I've been busy
Killing time, yeah
They ask my brothers
How long have I got
Now it's out there
On the clock
Now she said it
Killing time, yeah
So much changes
In a single word
So much changes
In a single word
Girlfriends have spoken
Six weeks before
A spell is broken
Just make sure you
Mean it when you say it
Six weeks time
So much changes
In a single word
