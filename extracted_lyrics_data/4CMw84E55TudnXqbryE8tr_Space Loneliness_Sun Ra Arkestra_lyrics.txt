1 ContributorSpace Loneliness LyricsWell it ain't the time
Ain't the time, ain't the time
For your excuses
Well it ain't the time
Ain't' the time, ain't the time
To 
Had about enough of you lying baby
Now it's time to say goodbye
Tell me who
Who do you think you are
Trying to play with my sweet heart
Now now now
Who do you think you are
Trying to sell me that pie in the sky
Had about enough of your lying baby
Now it's time to say bye bye
So like how you walked right in
You can walk right out
Like how you walked right in
You can walk right out
Sugar like you walked right in
You can walk right out
Baby like you walked right in
You can walk right out
It's been real good to know you
It's just time to say bye byeYou might also likeEmbed
