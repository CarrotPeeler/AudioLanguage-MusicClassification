"Well, you're magic," he said
But don't let it all go to your head
'Cause I bet if you all had it all figured out
Then you'd never get out of bed
Well, no doubt
Of all the things that I've read, what he wrote me
Is now soundin' like the man I was hoping
To be
I keep on keepin' it real
'Cause it keeps gettin' easier, he'll see
He's the reason that I'm laughing
Even if there's no one else
He said, you've got to love yourself

He said, you shouldn't mumble when you speak
But keep your tongue up in your cheek
And if you stumble onto somethin' better
Remember that it's humble that you seek
You got all the skill you need
Individuality
You got somethin'
Call it gumption
Call it anything you want
Because when you play the fool now
You're only foolin' everyone else
You're learnin' to love yourself
Yes you are
You are, yes
You might also like
You
You
You

There's no price to pay (No, no)
When you're givin' what you take
That's why it's easy to thank

You
You
You
You
You
You

Let's say take a break from our day
And get back to the old garage
Because life's too short anyway
But at least it's better than average
As long as you got me and I got you
You know we got a lot to go around
I'll be your friend, your other brother
Another love to come and comfort you
And I'll keep reminding
If it's the only thing I ever do
I will always love

You
You
You
You
You

It's true, our love is true
It's you I love, it's you I love, it's you
It's you I love
It's true, our love is true, our love is true
It's you I love
It's you I love, it's you I love, it's you
It's you, I love you, I do
Ooh it's you I love
(It's you I love, it's you I love, it's you, it's you I love)
Ooh it's you I love
(It's true, our love is true, our love is true, it's you I love)
(It's you I love, it's you I love, it's you, it's you I love)
Love, love, love, love
I will love, love, love
It's you I love, it's you
It's you I love, I love, I love
It's you I love, I love, I love
It's you I love, I love, I love
Ohh

Climb up over the top
Survey the state of the soul
You've got to find out for yourself
Whether or not you're truly trying
Why not give it a shot?
Shake it, take control
Inevitably wind up finding for yourself
All the strengths you have inside still rising
Climb up over the top
Survey the state of the soul
You've got to find out for yourself
Whether or not you're truly trying
Why not give it a shot?
Shake it, take control
Inevitably wind up finding for yourself
All the strengths you have inside still rising
Climb up over the top
Survey the state of the soul
You've got to find out for yourself
Whether or not you're true
(Whether or not you're truly trying)
It's you I love
(Why not give it a shot?)
Oh, it's you I love
(Shake it, take control)
Oh, it's you I love, I love, I love, love
(Inevitably wind up finding for yourself)
I love, I love you, yes, I do
(All the strengths you have inside still rising)
Climb up over the top
Survey the state of the soul
You’ve got to find out for yourself
Whether or not you’re truly tryin'
Why not give it a shot?
Shake it, take control
And inevitably wind up finding for yourself
All the strengths that you have inside of you5Embed
