2 ContributorsThereâ€™s So Many (Demo) Lyrics
There's so many things to think of
Why not think about my true love
And even though I can't be with her
I can still fantasize
There's so many girls to love
It's like tryin' to count the stars above
You love one's arms and another one's charms
With unique personalities

Darling
Why is it taking so long?
Darling
You know where you belong
Your face up in the sky, where angels fly
Up in the sky
Where planets are turning around

There's so many songs to sing
I'm thankful for the love they bring
To those who have broken hearts
They're gonna find brand new starts

Darling
You know where you belong
Darling
Why is it taking so long?
To get you in my arms
To feel your heart that feel you're strong
Where planets are turning around
You might also like
There's so many songs to sing
I'm thankful for the love they bring
To those who have broken hearts
They're gonna find brand new starts
