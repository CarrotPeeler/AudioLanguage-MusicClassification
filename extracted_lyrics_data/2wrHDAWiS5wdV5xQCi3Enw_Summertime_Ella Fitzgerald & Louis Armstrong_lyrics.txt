Summertime
And the livin' is easy
Fish are jumpin'
And the cotton is high
Oh, your daddy's rich
And your ma is good lookin'
So hush, little baby
Don't you cry

One of these mornin's
You gonna rise up singing
Yes, you'll spread your wings
And you'll take to the skies
Mmm, but 'til that morning
There's nothin' can harm you
Yes, with daddy and mammy standin' by

Summertime
And the livin' is easy
Fish are jumpin'
And the cotton is high
Oh, your daddy's rich (Daddy's rich)
And your ma is good lookin' (Your ma is good lookin')
So hush, little baby (Oh, yes)
Baby, don't you cry
You might also like
Oh, don't you cry
Oh, don't you cry (Don't you cry)
Oh, don't you cry
Oh, don't you cry2Embed
