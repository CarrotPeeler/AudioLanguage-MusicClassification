Are you close enough to kiss?
Are you brave enough to fail?
Are you strong enough to kill for what you love?
We are a home; we are the heart
That beats the backbone
And the spine
We are alone, we are the heart
That beats
Standing eye to eye
Are you rotten to the core?
Are you dead on the inside?
Are your failures not enough?
Are you strong enough to kill for what you love?
Love is love it's not enough to kill
