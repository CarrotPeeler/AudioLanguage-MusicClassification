3 ContributorsIf It Feels Good (Let It Ride) LyricsI don't know why you're here
You like the way I move
I like the face you wear, but let's not talk it away
I've got the whole night to tell you
Friendship to formula
Where will we both leave off?
Why don't we try to go slow?
Put all your numbers aside and let's start off with hello
Chorus:
And if it feels good, let it ride
Take a good long look at yourself and let it slide
I don't want to spend all day
On what may come tomorrow
And if it feels good, let it ride
Take a good long look at yourself and let it slide
I don't want to spend all day
On what may come tomorrow
Pick up the good stuff
If you left it outside
You've got your best friend to tell you
If it makes it rise, let it ride
Oh, let it ride, oh, let it ride
Oh, let it ride, oh, let it ride, oh, let it ride

If it feels good to you
What could be wrong if it's so right?
You'll pick it up like a child
I'm gonna teach you all night
Repeat Chorus
On what may come tomorrow
On what may come tomorrowEmbed
