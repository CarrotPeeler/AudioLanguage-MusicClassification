1 ContributorA Broken Whisper Lyrics
Silence slowly comes to me
Embraces me so tight to keep me cold
A thought that's drifting through my mind
Struggles to be free and wails alone

Embraces me
So tight
Struggles to
Be free
We turn to stone
We don't find home

Can you hear this broken whisper?
Can you hear it how it calls?
We turn to stone
We don't find home

Embraces me
So tight
Struggles to
Be free
We turn to stone
We don't find home
You might also like
Can you hear this broken whisper?
Can you hear it how it calls?
We turn to stone
We don't find homeEmbed
