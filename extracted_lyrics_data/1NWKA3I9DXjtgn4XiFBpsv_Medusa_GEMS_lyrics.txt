We'll leave it behind in a memory

I touch your face with all the spark
I see your shadow feeding slowly in the dark
I lay awake and I'm caught in between
What we lost, I'm afraid we'll never be

I used to feel so free, the way we used to be
Time got away from me
I used to feel so free, the way we used to be
Time got away from me

If you cry out, I'll be there now
I'll be there now
If you cry out, I'll be there now
I'll be there now
If you cry out, I'll be there now
I'll be there now
If you cry out, I'll be there now
I'll be there now

Now every night I lay awake in my bed
While these dreams turn to stone in spite of me
No will to fight and I'm trapped in my head
All these dreams become haunting memories
You might also like
I used to feel so free, the way we used to be
Time got away from me
I used to feel so free, the way we used to be
Time got away from me

If you cry out, I'll be there now
I'll be there now
If you cry out, I'll be there now
I'll be there now
If you cry out, I'll be there now
I'll be there now
If you cry out, I'll be there now
I'll be there now

You're so far away
You're so far away
You're so far away
You're so far away
You're so far awayEmbed
