5 ContributorsKnock You Out LyricsSomebody to rough you up
Somebody to make it tough
Somebody to beat you
Somebody to love, but wait..
Is it still love you want?
Somebody to pamper
Somebody to blame it on
Somebody to love, but wait...
Baby, Baby I want to be true
You gotta knock me out some other way
And I want to be with the sun and the moon
I've been hopeless, I've been out on a (give me 1, 2)
Baby, Baby I want to be true
You gotta knock me out some other way
And I want to be with the sun and the moon
I've been hopeless, I've been out on a limb
Somebody to take you out
Somebody to show you how
Somebody to train you
Somebody to love, but wait..
Is it still love you want?
Somebody to put you down
Somebody to smack you round
Somebody to love, but wait...
