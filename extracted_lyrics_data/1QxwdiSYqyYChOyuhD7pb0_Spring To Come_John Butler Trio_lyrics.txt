4 ContributorsSpring To Come Lyrics
Lost my love, lost my light
I can't find them anymore
If there's something I could give
I would have given it before now, because

I came back a little broken
Things don't fit anymore

And I wait for spring to come
But how long?
Tell me how long
'Cause I wither at my post
I'm walking like a ghost, alone
How long?
Tell me how long
How long?

Somewhere out there on the horizon
Maybe there's a glimmer of hope
Maybe it's just a mirage
'Cause you never know
You might also like
And maybe things have changed
Storm clouds pass, take their rains

And I wait for spring to come
But how long?
Tell me how long
'Cause I wither at my post
I'm walking like a ghost, alone
How long?
Tell me how long
How long?

Out of the darkness, only light can come
After a lonely, long night comes the sun
Out of the darkness, only light can come
After a lonely, long night comes the sun
Out of the darkness, only light can come
After a lonely, long night comes the sun
Out of the darkness, only light can come
After a lonely, long night comes the sun1Embed
