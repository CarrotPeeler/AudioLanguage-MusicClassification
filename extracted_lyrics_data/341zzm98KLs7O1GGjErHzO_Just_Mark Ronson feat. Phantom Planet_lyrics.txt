Can't get the stink off
He's been hanging 'round for days
Comes like a comet
Suckered you but not your friends

One day, he'll get to you
And teach you how to be a holy cow

You do it to yourself, you do
And that's what really hurts
'Cause you do it to yourself, just you
You and no one else
You do it to yourself
You do it to yourself

Do it, do it to yourself

Don't get my sympathy
Hanging out the fifteenth floor
You've changed the locks three times
He still comes reeling through the door
You might also like
One day, I'll get to you
And teach you how to get to purest hell

You do it to yourself, you do
And that's what really hurts
'Cause you do it to yourself, just you
You and no one else
You do it to yourself
You do it to yourself


You do it to yourself, you do
And that's what really hurts
'Cause you do it to yourself, just you
You and no one else
You do it to yourself
You do it to yourself
You do it to yourself
Oh, to yourself
You do it to yourself

Do it to yourself, do it to yourself, do it to yourself
You do it to yourself
Do it to yourself
Do it, do it, do it to yourself
Do it, do it, you do it to yourself
Do it, do it to yourself
Do it, do it to yourself
Do it to yourselfEmbed
