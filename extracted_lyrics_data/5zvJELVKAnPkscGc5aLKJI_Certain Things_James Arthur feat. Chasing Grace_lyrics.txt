23 ContributorsCertain Things Lyrics
Something about you
It's like an addiction
Hit me with your best shot, honey
I've got no reason to doubt you
'Cause certain things hurt, and you're
My only virtue and I'm virtually yours

And you keep coming back, coming back again
Keep running 'round, running 'round, running 'round my head

And there's certain things that I adore
And there's certain things that I ignore
But I'm certain that I'm yours
Certain that I'm yours
Certain that I'm yours

There's something about you
It's when you get angry, you have me at
Your mercy, oh
And you're like the shoulder to turn to
'Cause certain things mend us when we're
Hanging on for dear life, we held on so tight

And you keep coming back, coming back again
Keep running 'round, running 'round, running 'round my head

And there's certain things that I adore (Certain things that I adore)
And there's certain things that I ignore
But I'm certain that I'm yours
Certain that I'm yours (I'm certain that I'm yours)
Certain that I'm yours (Certain)

There's certain things that I adore (There's certain things that I adore)
And there's certain things that I ignore (Let's ignore them, let's ignore them)
But I'm certain that I'm yours
Certain that I'm yours (I adore you, I adore you)
I am certain that I'm yours
(Let's ignore them, let's ignore them)

I am certain I adore you (I adore you, I adore you)
I am certain I adore you (Oh, I adore you, I adore you)
I am certain I adore you
(Let's ignore them, let's ignore them)
Let's ignore them, let's ignore them (Let's ignore them, let's ignore them)
I'm certain that I'm yours1Embed
