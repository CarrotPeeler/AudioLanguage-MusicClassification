1 ContributorGonna Get You Someday Lyrics
Oh no baby your love's killing me
I know I’m gonna get you someday

Treat me bad and bring me pain
Making me feel like I'm insane
Watching you day and night but that's hardly a crime
I don’t think all this is fair
Putting me away on mental care
Feeding me sedative pills until I'm out of my mind
I'm going crazy

Oh no baby your love's killing me
I know it will get me someday
I'm banging the walls but I just can't penetrate
Oh no it's gonna blow me away
I know I'm gonna get you someday

My roommate was a businessman
Killed his friend with a frying pan
Now he’s been walked in the yard two times a day
You might also likeThis place gives me the creeps
And the nurse from Hell is getting down on me
She looks like you in a cold sadistic way
(And she says) "I’m gonna get you"

Oh no baby your love's killing me
I know it will get me someday
I’m banging the walls but I just can't penetrate
Oh no it's gonna blow me away
I know I'm gonna get you someday

If my mind is getting clear
I’m gonna get me out of here
Then there's nothing more to fear
For you

Oh no baby your love's killing me
I know it will get me someday
I'm banging the walls but I just can't penetrate
Oh no it's gonna blow me away
I know I'm gonna get you someday
Oh no baby your love's killing me
I know it will get me someday
I'm banging the walls but I just can't penetrate
Oh no it's gonna blow me away
I know I'm gonna get you somedayEmbed
