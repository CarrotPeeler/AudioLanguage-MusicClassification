6 ContributorsWhen I Say Jump, You Say How High Lyrics
Things felt so perfect, was it worth it?
People talk and they talk I'm so sick of it
I've made a monster, love gone wrong
I'll pay for the past and the things I've done

You'll never let this go
You're still hooked on mistakes I've made
Mistakes that I've made
Just give it time
This feeling haunts my mind
Just give it some time

I'll scream
Look away, close your eyes
Your voice changes reveals what's inside
Cold-hearted tears that lie
Waste away four whole years of my life
And you're gone into the past
I've done all that I can
I'm gone, you're gone

I won't regret relieving
Myself of this feeling
Now begins the healing
And it's my time you were killing
I'm the reason you have changed
A harlot that makes this a broken clich√©
I'll fall if I give into you
You'll lie and you'll steal my identity's truth
You might also like
You'll never let this go
You're still hooked on mistakes I've made
Mistakes that I've made
Just give it time
This feeling haunts my mind
Just give it some time
You'll never let this go
You're still hooked on mistakes I've made
Mistakes that I've made
Just give it time
This feeling haunts my mind
(This feeling haunts my mind)
(Just give it some time)

(This feeling haunts my mind)
(Just give it some time)
The sooner you're off my mind, the better
The sooner you're off my mind
The sooner you're off my mind1Embed
