1 ContributorA Dying World LyricsStanding high above the crawling wasted
World
Another day goes by and still we carry
On
Run another stretch of road that knows
No end
Watch the fires burn beneath the
Blackened sky
Standing high above the crawling wasted
World
Look close as cities fall
Stark white the bombs explode
And we carry on, and still the story
Goes
For there is no end, no shelter from
This age
Bright the running lights remind me of
My home
But blackened steel and bitter dust
Still call my heart
Shadowed hands tight beneath the
Blackened sky
Shadowed words hold true and
Nothing stands as strong before this
Storm
As life is so short and tomorrow might
Not come for us
I will not fall, no pain can hold, and
Still I have a smile
You might also likeIn a world decayed we walk against the
Fall
Watching as the past burns down, and
Future builds a future bold
I live to breathe, to feel As real
For death looks on an ever changing
