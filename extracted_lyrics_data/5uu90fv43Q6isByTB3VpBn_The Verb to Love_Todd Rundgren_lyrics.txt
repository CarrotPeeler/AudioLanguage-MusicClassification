3 ContributorsThe Verb “To Love” Lyrics
Some people tell me that love is a feeling
Or a possession
Somehow it seems so cold
Somehow it seems so cold
And when they say love is sweet, does it mean that you eat it?
Maybe you drink it?
Does it fill up an empty hole? Yeah

(Looking for a love)
I'm looking for a love and I may not find it
(Looking for a love)
You know it doesn't mean a thing without some action behind it, yeah

(Please come home)
I can hear them calling "please come home"
(Please don't leave us all alone)
Your mama and your papa are crying all alone
You better let it magnetize, learn to sacrifice
'Til we get the true version of the meaning of the verb "to love"

(What does it mean to love?)
The meaning of the verb "to love"
(What does it mean to love?)
You might also like
And when somebody needs love do they spend some money?
Say something funny?
Ask for some tenderness? Only tenderness?
And when you want to touch love do you lie on your back?
Stand on your head?
How do you feel it best? Woo hoo hoo

(Looking for a love)
I'm looking for a love with no strings attached
(Looking for a love)
To take me like I am, that's the only catch, yeah yeah yeah

(Please come home)
I can hear them calling "please come home"
(Please don't leave us all alone)
Your wife and your lover are crying all alone
You better let it magnetize, learn to sacrifice
'Til we learn the true version of the meaning of the verb "to love"

Does it mean any more the more you talk about it?
(Sing another song of love)
Is it anymore real if you jump around and shout it?
I'm sick and tired of hearing 'bout everyone without it and
Too much talking sends me walking
Night is falling and everybody's calling for love

(Looking for a love)
Everybody's lookin' for their one and only
(Looking for a love)
It's only just a game 'cause they're scared to be lonely
Woo hoo hoo

(Please come home)
I can hear them calling "please come home"
(Please don't leave us all alone)
Your brothers and your sisters are crying all alone
You got let it magnetize, learn to sacrifice
'Til we get the true version of the meaning of the verb "to love"
