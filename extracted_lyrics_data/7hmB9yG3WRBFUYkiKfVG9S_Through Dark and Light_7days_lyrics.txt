1 ContributorAnd It Was Good Lyrics
In the beginning, God created the heavens and earth

You sang 7 notes, the big bang in your throat, framed in creation and proclaim that it's dope
The word was God and the beginning when He spoke
Through the quote of a quote, the quote of a quote
You sang 7 notes, the big bang in your throat, framed and creation and proclaim that its dope
The word was God and the beginning when He spoke
Through the quote of a quote, the quote of the quote

On the first day of creation, he created the light

(it's day 1) It all started with a formless void, until the Lord clapped His hands together, joy jumping outta the noise
Heard the face of the deep water reflected His poise, while He hovered over silence, still selecting His choice
Touch His hands to His eye just to ready His sight and let His voice rang out "now let there be light"
And it was good, dark split apart quick fast leavin' thus He separated the morning from the evening
Breathe in another gale force into His chest, called the light day, God almighty still described it best
He called the dark night like only He could
(Yeah, 1 day down and He saw that it was good)

On the second day, he created the firmament

And when the morning face came in and blow kisses to its ebony now mister and misses, this is a new birth
Water was broken, yoke equally given to earth when His word was spoke, separation, expansion from land to sky
Was now made in His perfect plan, so when we see the stars, a view from a collection of atmospheric sessions
We recognize His blessings, it's not a simple thought, we brainstorm in clouds as He delivers every thunderous rain, it's all now
I'm seeing, all of this shall work as it should
(Yeah, 2 days down and he found that it was good)

On the third day, He created the land, trees and the waters

There was evening and morning, it came without warning, in perfect series the earth was dawnin', from one thought, everything
One breath is all of breathing, words can't come close to the gifts You were leaving, in one hand, every mountain
The other, all the seas, You thunder-clapped them together, flooded it with trees
The rocks hug side by side and packed themselves in dirt and hold on for life to build the earth for what it's worth
The seas stretched out fingers grasping for the rivers, the crops bow down to the sun so fruit that can deliver
At first light the invention, earth and water has been glued
(3 days down and He saw that it was good)

On the fourth day, He created the sun, moon and stars

Diggin' deep, both hands in the sky's expansion, the shimmerin' glimmer deliver lights that's dancin'
The flash and the crack, deep space looking desolate, the night He called it a day, ripped 'em until they're separate
The light of the world with darkness to kill, marking days into years, before it, time stood still
Sun for the measurement, moon like it's heaven sent, reason for the season and He made where the weather went
The moon took over when the sun need a getaway, licked his palm, smudged the stars in the milky way
Two lights govern, night and morning understood
(4 days down and He said that it was good)
On the fifth day, He created the fishes of the mighty deep and the birds of the air

Day 5, I watch as the waters explode with a swell, the breath of life blown across the sea floor shelves
Every kind of sea creature from marlins to whales, from sharks to dolphins and manatees to snails
God prevails in His timing and precision creating all species so I stay careful to listen
Not a single one missin' 'cause I've counted 'em all and I look up to the sky 'cause I hear Him sounding the call
With a rush I see airborn life in a winged form, He told them to be fruitful so new seeds could be born
He spoke life with authority and all was understood
(5 days down and He found that it was good)

On the sixth day, He created the animals and late that evening He made man in His own image and man became a living soul

4 rivers convened in the garden of Eden, all the brush needs tending and the soil needs seedin'
Rain never left a cloud, this world reflects its infancy, the moisture from the ground manifested in its destiny
One being of flesh to monitor the harvest, to name all the beasts, no job could be hardest, the Master said to do it
It was no questions asked, he had respect for his Maker and his difficult task, fell into a deep sleep, awoken with help
A beautiful creation built from inside of himself, the two became flesh as God said that it should
(6 days down and He saw that it was good)

The artist is divine, reclined on the downs, the grass spilled a dewy hill that pillowed His crown
He blew a cloud billow, r.e.m. sleeping so sound, stretched His legs across a winding river finding the ground
Six days grinding down, finally surrounded Himself with the masterpiece of peaceful renown
No equal found and He knew that it was perfect, so He set apart the seventh day for worship
The cure fit to recharge the circuits, starving for their purpose, we're the many verses in this lullaby to earth
It's slumbered in the thunder, heaven's under the hood
(7 days down and He said that it was good)
You sang 7 notes, the big bang in Your throat, framed in creation the genesis of our hope
The word was God in the beginning when He spoke
