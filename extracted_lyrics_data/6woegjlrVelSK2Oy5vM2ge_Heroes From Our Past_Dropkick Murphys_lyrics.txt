5 ContributorsHeroes from Our Past LyricsAnd so the story's told of a hearty group of men
It's a tale of their triumphs and their woes
Be it raids and melees ancient or the modern workers struggle
And inspires men to stand up for their rights
And should we fall down by the wayside in this ever-changing world
We can look back to these heroes of our past
With their staunch determination and ferocious iron will
No tyranny would quell them in their task
It's an age old situation with an ever present message
That time and tide waiteth for no man
So with out fear of confrontation and the consequence of outcome
It's for freedom and for happiness they toiled
And in looking to the future we can see a better place
Where we can shake the yoke of tyranny for all
It's been paved by generations who have gone now to their rest
It's just remembrance of their dignity we ask
(chorus) so come on rally 'round this brave and valiant cause
With tradition pride and honor at it's core
With swords drawn to defend stood these noblehearted men
Faugh-an-ballagh clear the way me boys
Under perilous conditions with small hope of success
They left behind the lives that they once led
And by virtue of their fortitude and singleminded strength
They cleared the way for the people of today
So when we think back to our ancestors respectfully we hark
And thank the men whose struggle broke the chain
It's a long road up ahead of us let's forge on while we're strong
And leave our mark of honor once again

With tradition pride and honor at it's core
With swords drawn to defend stood these noblehearted men
Faugh-an-ballagh clear the way me boys
And so the story's told and it comes now to an end
It's setting any era any land
When abusive tyrants force the hands of matters great or small
It inspires men to stand up for their rightsEmbed
