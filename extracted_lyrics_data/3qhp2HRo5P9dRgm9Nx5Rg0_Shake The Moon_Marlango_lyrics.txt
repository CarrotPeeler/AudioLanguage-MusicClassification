1 ContributorShake The Moon LyricsShake the moon
Shake the moon inside your glass
Fit the sky
Make the sky fit into your eye
Stomp the floor
Brake the floor when you pace along
Scratch the air when you laugh
Squeeze the universe
Between your fingers
It all fits inside a little boys pocket
Car, stone
Space rocket
Moth, fly
Gun, match
Grab a match
And burn the universe
Pebble, doll
Flower, stone
Knife, a war
Grab a stone
And brake the universeYou might also likeEmbed
