6 ContributorsStar Bellied Boy Lyrics
He said he wanted to
Just touch you
He said he wanted to
Just touch you

Star bellied boy, different from the rest
You're so different from the rest
Prove you're different from the rest
You're no fucking different from the rest

And then he said "Why won't you fuck me?"
And then he said "Do me, do me, do me,"
And then he said "I'll be your best friend,"
And then I said

"Why do I cry every time that I cum?"

I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't cum
I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't cum
I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't cum
I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't cum
