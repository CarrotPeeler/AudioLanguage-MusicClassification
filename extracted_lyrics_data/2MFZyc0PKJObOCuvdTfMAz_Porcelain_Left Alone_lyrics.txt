Blue eyed girls never seem to wanna talk
Never thought she'd ever wanna piece of my heart
Cause guys like me never end up on top
Never thought she'd ever wanna piece of my heart
Blue eyed girls never seem to wanna talk
Never thought she'd ever wanna piece of my heart
Cause guys like me never should end up on top
Cause I want you to feel
Everything that was real in my heart love
She's an angel that fell from the top
Cause I want you to feel
Everything that was real in my heart love
She's an angel that fell from the top
Never thought I'd ever learn to love hate now
But that comes easy after what you put me through
Never thought I'd ever learn to forget you now
Seems nothing you said was ever true
Cause I want you to feel
Everything that was real in my heart love
She's an angel that fell from the top
Cause I want you to feel
Everything that was real in my heart love
She's an angel that fell from the top (fell from the top)
Cause I want you to feel
Everything that was real in my heart love
She's an angel that fell from the top
Cause I want you to feel
Everything that was real in my heart love
She's an angel that fell from the top (fell from the top)You might also likeEmbed
