6 ContributorsFalse Start Lyrics
On a point in time, present undefined
And it's getting cold outside
Situation statical for reasons you don't know
Just short of indecision and it's getting cold outside
And it's getting cold outside

For you own trepidation, refer to new perspexion
See yourself as others see you, in reverse, red can appear blue
Wanna go outside?
Don't you wanna go outside?

Been stuck inside your room
So stranded-like and full of doom all year
Time out for good behavior
Adds up to what you want it to
What you wanna, what you wanna do

What informs a motivation? Casual or obligation
Factitious circumstance suspending all your future plans
Wait for you outside
If this false started motion believes its own propulsion
Transcending space and time, then I'll wait for you outside
Then I'll wait for you outside
You might also like
Been so long since I've seen you
So much has changed, you sound the same
We're meeting at this place
I wanna see you see your face again
We're all waiting, we're all waiting hereEmbed
