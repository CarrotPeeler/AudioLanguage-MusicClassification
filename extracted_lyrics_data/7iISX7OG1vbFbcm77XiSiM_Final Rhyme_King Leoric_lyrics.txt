3 ContributorsActual Proof LyricsHook: Awon
Everybody said the game needs a boost
Shit is too sweet water down with the juice
Ghostwriters and beat makers who can't produce
Awon and Phoniks the actual proof
(x2)
Verse 1: Awon
This is that shy day dining lights, spitting gangsta shit on designer mics
Not knowing niggas can rhyme alike
I spazz on contemporary jazz with champagne in my glass
L to the face, the soul in the past
My arrogance is a compliment, sign of respect
I acknowledge my enemies before I catch rek
Mask off fuck it, live with no regrets
Means are easy kill when the machetes on your neck
Better protect your hustle, I'm coming for your checks
I'm Deebo, every four bars like a kilo
The elephant to your ego, I play the game Cerebro
Steph Curry for free-throw
Hook: Awon
Everybody said the game needs a boost
Shit is too sweet water down with the juice
Ghostwriters and beat makers who can't produce
Awon and Phoniks the actual proof

Stepping in my Stan Smith's
Writing rhymes in my hand style, so they can't read what they can't spit
I'm King Midas, with lyrical gifts I'm spitting Kryptonite
So even Superman could get clipped if I get the mic
Today couldn't be more bright, my glasses are transition
Google Maps on mission, peep this while I'm fishing
On tracks I'm flipping like Olympic gold gymnasts, I ice skate
I burn rappers to they soul cuz they lightweight
My tight face is bold and my veins bleed gold, my tears are nitrate
Sodium chloride, a nuclear reactor
I'm ready to blow, let's fallout for rappers
Threw it all I'm dapper, but keep a rugged face
Cuz it's hard to master, the final steps to greats
Lyrically a beast complete absorb knowledge
Either you gon' want this war or pay homageEmbed
