1 ContributorSure of Love Lyrics
(Sure, so sure, so sure of love)

I need no stars to guide me
I need no sun to shine
Long as you're near beside me
No greater love could be mine

I need no Swallows to cheer me
I hear no music in the streams
While your tender words are falling
I'm sure of love in all my dreams

I need no kingdom
I need no throne
With you I have my treasure
It's mine, mine alone

Long as your near I'm happy
I'm happy night and day
Now that you're near beside me
I'm sure our love won't fade away
You might also like
(Sure so sure so sure of love)
