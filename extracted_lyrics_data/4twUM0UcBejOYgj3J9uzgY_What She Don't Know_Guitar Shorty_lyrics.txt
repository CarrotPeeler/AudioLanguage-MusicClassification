1 ContributorDigital LyricsThings today are not what they seem
You wouldn't like to look behind the scenes
That girl is not what she appears to be
When she appears on your TV
Airbrushed autotuned and pretty as can be
I don't have to sing my notes on key
Because a robot sings it right for me
Because the robot sings it right for me
Hey didn't you know
That it's digital
A million tiny pixels
Buzzin' before your eyes
Kid you've got the look of a star
It doesn't even matter how good you are
To speak these words into that mac
Something 12 year olds will like
We'll put you up on silver screens
We'll make your voice sound like a scream
Don't worry you don't have to sing on key
The robot sings right as right can be
The robot sings right as right can be (x3)
The robot will sing it right for me
Hey didn't you know
That it's digital
A million tiny pixels
Buzzin' before your eyes
Hey didn't you know
That it's digital
A million tiny pixels
A million little lies
(short guitar solo)
Hey didn't you know
That it's digital
A million tiny pixels
Buzzin' before your eyes
Hey didn't you know
That it's digital
A million tiny pixels
A million little liesYou might also likeEmbed
