6 ContributorsAnimal Games LyricsYour heart is like a dough
You shape it how you want
I can't stop thinking of
How that makes me want you at all
Now you're playing all these games
That I don't know how to play
Now you say you love me
But next you're going away
So I find new love
'Cause that is what I do
Now you're scaring off the doe
Killing off the sparrow
Howling like a wolf
Poisoning the arrow
You shake the rope I'm walking
Just to catch me when I fall
Turn while I'm still talking
Next time I'll be gone
A red kiss in a letter
That is all you'll find

Killing off the sparrow
Howling like a wolf
Poisoning the arrow
Now you're creeping in the reeds
Spying like an eagle
Fighting like a rooster
Blood is in the water
Now I'm playing all these games
I'm getting better and better
I'm getting better and better
Yeah, I'm getting better and better
So I find new love
'Cause that is what I doEmbed
