5 ContributorsDo Me Good Lyrics

Got back together with my man last night
But I think I was dreaming, he didn't feel quite right
I pressed his chest under my fingertips
Beside myself, I sighed
I'm reminded of his lips

I'm confused and quizzical
Bunny wants you now
I just wanna get physical
Let me tell you how

Do me good, I'll tell you anything you want to hear
(Do me good, do me good, do me good, do me good, we out)
Do me good and all this craziness will disappear
(Do me good, do me good, do me good, do me good, we out)

It's like he was designed with me in mind
He's so broad from behind, he's beautifully defined
I missed him most of all when it got late
Attempt to hear him breathing
Or feel his shifting weight
You might also like
So I'm confused and quizzical
Bunny wants you now
I just wanna get physical
Let me tell you how

Do me good, I'll tell you anything you want to hear
(Do me good, do me good, do me good, do me good, we out)
Do me good and all this craziness will disappear
(Do me good, do me good, do me good, do me good, we out)
Do me good, I'll tell you anything you want to hear
(Do me good, do me good, do me good, do me good, we out)
Do me good and all this craziness will disappear
(Do me good, do me good, do me good, do me good, we out)
Do me good, I'll tell you anything you want to hear
(Do me good, do me good, do me good, do me good, we out)
Do me good and all this craziness will disappear
(Do me good, do me good, do me good, do me good, we out)

Do me good, I'll tell you anything you want to hear
Do me good and all this craziness will disappear
Do me good, I'll tell you anything you want to hear
Do me good and all this craziness will disappear1Embed
