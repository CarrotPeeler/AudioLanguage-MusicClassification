7 ContributorsNot the Same Lyrics
On this day where you're so messed it's clear
Can't explain the world you roam
Anyone who's been
As I walk with you, it chills me so
To hear you say it's come to this
And that it's okay

In a dream, I always talk to you
You seem fine again, my sweet
Feels alright to me
Is it right for you?
Flipping out I try to call to you
Do you call to me?
Tell me what to do
And I know it's not the same, there's no blame - still I bother you
And you say it's not your deal, it's mine to feel - follow along with you

Come alive I know you'll sing to me
I won't' sing to you
It is not a thing I do
Has it been a different feel for you?
The whole time this was going on
Or is it something new?
You might also likeAnd I know it's not the same, there is no blame - still I'm bothering you
And you say it's not your deal, it's mine to feel - you would not pull me through
Anyway, you're not the same, it's the blame - follow along with you

It's a lingering that comes through me
Does it come to you?
Are we really through?
Any guy would do this thing for me
It's not much to ask
Why can't you?
I'm not going to say I have had my way
You sure saw to that
But what else can I do?
You promised so much that I would never touch
I believed in you
For the last timeEmbed
