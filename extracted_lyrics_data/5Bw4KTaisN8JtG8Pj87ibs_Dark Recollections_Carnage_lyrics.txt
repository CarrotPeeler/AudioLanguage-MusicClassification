1 ContributorThe Rolling Massgrave LyricsTwo bands are sitting in a car
Going very fast on the highway
Drinking many beers and eating chips
One of the boys sees a bomb in the backseat
Bomb in the car, carnage!
Blow up the boys, bloodbath!
The car is all bloody, oh yea!
Carnage!
The car turned into a rolling massgrave
Dark recollections on the stereo
Scattered bodies float in blood and beer
The chips are glowing in the gore
The chips are glowing in the gore
The car is still going very fast, everyone is dead
The police cannot stop them 'cause the driver has no head
Some earplugs fell out from a broken window
The police got mad and started shooting at the carYou might also likeEmbed
