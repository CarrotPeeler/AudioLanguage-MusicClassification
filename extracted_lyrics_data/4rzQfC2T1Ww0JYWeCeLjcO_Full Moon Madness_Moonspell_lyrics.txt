Lobos que foram homens e o tornarão a ser
They awake for flesh
Choose pain as a path
Refuse a light to blind you and me
Full moon madness
We are as one and congregate
Full moon madness
We rise again to procreate
Somos memórias de lobos que rasgam a pele
Lobos que foram homens e o tornarão a ser
Ou talvez memórias de homens
Que insistem em não rasgar a pele
Homens que procuram ser lobos
Mas que jamais o tornarão a ser
They awake for flesh
Choose pain as a path
Refuse a light to blind you and me
Full moon madness
We are as one and congregate
Full moon madness
We rise again to procreate, to seal our fate

And eternity lost its sex forever
And under the same heaven they voted emptiness
They still celebrate under a full moon madness
They awake for flesh
Choose pain as a path
Refuse a light to blind you and me
Irreverence was cast out from the sky
And eternity lost its sex forever
And under the same heaven we voted emptiness
We still celebrate under a full moon madnessEmbed
