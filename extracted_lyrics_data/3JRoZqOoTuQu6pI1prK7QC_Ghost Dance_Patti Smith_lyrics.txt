What is it children that falls from the sky
Tayi taya tayi aye aye
Manna from heaven from the most high
Food from the father tayi taya aye
We shall live again we shall live again
We shall live again shake out the ghost dance
We shall live
Peace to your brother, give and take eat
Tayi taya dance little feet
One foot extended snake to the ground
Wave up the earth worm turn around
We shall live again we shall live again
We shall live again shake out the ghost dance
We shall live
Stretch out your arms now dip and sway
Bird of thy birth tayi taya
The oe of the shoe the ou of the soul
Dust of the word that shakes from the tail
We shall live again we shall live again
We shall live again shake out the ghost dance
We shall live
You might also likeHere we are, Father your Holy Ghost
Bread of your bread host of your host
We are the tears that fall from your eyes
Word of your word cry of your cry
We shall live again we shall live again
We shall live again shake out the ghost dance
We shall live
What is it Father
In your eye
What is this wisdom
Eyes of God
That makes me feel
Just what I need
You supply me
Ways of speed
What is it Father
Holy that night
What is it Father...Embed
