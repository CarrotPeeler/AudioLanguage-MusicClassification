23 ContributorsThe Chauffeur Lyrics
Out on the tar plains, the glides are moving
All looking for a new place to drive
You sit beside me, so newly charming
Sweating dew drops glisten, freshing your side

And the sun drips down, bedding heavy behind
The front of your dress all shadowy lined
And the droning engine throbs in time
With your beating heart

Way down the lane away, living for another day
The aphids swarm up in the drifting haze
Swim, seagull in the sky, towards that hollow western isle
My envied lady holds you fast in her gaze

And the sun drips down, bedding heavy behind
The front of your dress all shadowy lined
And the droning engine throbs in time
With your beating heart

And the sun drips down, bedding heavy behind
The front of your dress all shadowy lined
And the droning engine throbs in time
With your beating heart
You might also like
Sing blue silver

And watching lovers part, I feel you smiling
What glass splinters lie so deep in your mind
To tear out from your eyes with a word to stiffen brooding lies
But I'll only watch you leave me further behind

And the sun drips down, bedding heavy behind
The front of your dress all shadowy lined
And the droning engine throbs in time
With your beating heart

And the sun drips down, bedding heavy behind
The front of your dress all shadowy lined
The droning engine throbs in time
With your beating heart

Sing blue silver
Sing, sing blue silver

"Known as Albert Schweitzer
There's more to this kind of camouflage, more than just colour and shape
Who's crawling now in the tall grass near my tent?
