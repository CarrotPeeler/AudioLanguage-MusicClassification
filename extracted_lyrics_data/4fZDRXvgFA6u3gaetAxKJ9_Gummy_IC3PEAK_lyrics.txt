I can not stir
I hear my heart beat
All is still
All but my own heart
I can not stir (All is still, all but my own heart)
I hear my heart beat (I can not stir, I hear my heart beat)
I can not stir (All is still, all but my own heart)
I hear my heart beat (I can not stir, I hear my heart beat)


All is still
All but my own heart
I can not stir
I hear my heart beat
All is still
All but my own heart
I can not stir
I hear my heart beat
I can not stir
I hear my heart beat
All is still
All but my own heart
