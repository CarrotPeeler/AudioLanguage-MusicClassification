1 ContributorOverboard LyricsI really love it here, and I hope you know that I mean that
My ex-life is but a greeting card, or a sitcom show on the TV set
But your apartment is very "you", and I woke in the wrong room
I miss the drives we took, and I wonder when I look back
Why you said you could go for a few hours if I want
When your apartment's so very "you", it seems pointless
Open the doors
Pick up your bags and file through
Settling scores
Settling who I am without you
Because it's over if you say so
It's such fun to live a life that isn't "yours"
But I went overboardYou might also likeEmbed
