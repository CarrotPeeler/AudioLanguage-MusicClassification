5 ContributorsAfterworld LyricsDanger up ahead
Just ignore the warning signs instead
Toughen up and break the rules that hold you down
Smash the glass, shoot straight
Don't look back, we wear the mask of fate
Just live your life loud and proud
Don't back down
Live your life, take a risk
We'll never die in the afterworld
In the end, start again
We'll stay alive in the afterworld
Live your life, take a risk
There's no goodbye in he after world
In the end, start again
We'll never die in the after world
Die
When we wanna, you know we're gonna
Die
When we wanna, you know we gotta
Die
When we wanna, you know we will
Die

We'll stay alive in the afterworld
Live your life, take a risk
