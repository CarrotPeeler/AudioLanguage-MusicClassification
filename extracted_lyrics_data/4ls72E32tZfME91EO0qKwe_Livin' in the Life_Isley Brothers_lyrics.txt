5 ContributorsLivinâ€™ in the Life Lyrics
Somebody said, I was livin' in the life
Somebody told me, I was livin' in the life
Think that you might know, you find that you're reading me wrong
My patience come and go, but my livin' has got to go on

And if you think it's easy, it's only 'cause
You ain't me, and I ain't you
Check out the difference between the two

Somebody said, it was easy in my life
Somebody told me, I had made it in my life
Try to understand my determination when
You can only stand on the outside looking in

And if you think it's easy it's only 'cause
You ain't me, and I ain't you
Ha, check out the difference between the two

Somebody said, I was livin' in the life
Somebody told me, I was livin' in the life
Try to understand my determination when
You can only stand on the outside looking in
You might also like
Oh, you ain't me, and I ain't you
There's a helluva difference between the twoEmbed
