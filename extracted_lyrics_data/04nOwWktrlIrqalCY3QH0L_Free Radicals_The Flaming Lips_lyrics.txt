You think you're so radical
I think you ought to stop (Say what?)
But you're going international
They're going to call the cops (No, no, no)
You're turning into
A poor man's Donald Trump
I know those circumstances
Make you want to jump
Oh no

You think you're radical
But you're not so radical
In fact, you're fanatical
Fanatical
You think you're radical
But you're not so radical
In fact, you're fanatical
Fanatical

Woah!
I'll tell you right now (Right now)
You ought to change your mind (Yes!)
All of your friends are (Uh-huh)
Standing in a line
They're getting tired of
Your attitude fast
(Da-da-da-da-da)
(Da-da-da-da-da)
Without all your bodyguards
How long would you last?
Not long (Not long)
