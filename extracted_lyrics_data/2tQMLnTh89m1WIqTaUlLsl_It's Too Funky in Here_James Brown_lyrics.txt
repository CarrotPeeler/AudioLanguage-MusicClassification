Bass needs a little watering down

Guitar could use a little cool-uh sound-hyuh!
Uh!

Open up the window, y'all! Let out some!

Too funky in here! Woo!

Gimme some air!

Here are the man ain't leaving no slack-uh! Ha
Horns ain't holding nothing back! Ooo, uh
Whole band knows that they getting down
The air's polluted with a fun-kay, fun-kay sound

Now say it again
(Too funky, funky in here)
Bleegy deeky, bleegy deeky
(Funkity-funk, funk-funkity-air)
Say it again, I can't hear you
(Too funky, funky in here)
Open the door, gimme some!
(Funkity-funk, funk-funkity-air)
In the bridge, y'all!

Guitar man!! Put it in you funky hand
And play!
Getting down tha's right!
My name is Brown, let's go

Too funky, too funky in here, say it
(Too funky, funky in here)
Gimme some air, say it
(Funkity-funk, funk-funkity-air)

Disco soul when you hit this thing
Doing the bak ah, nobody wants to change
If somebody soon don't open the door
Lotta people goin' knocked out on that bedroom floor

And say it's too
(Too funky, funky in here)
Open the door, let me, let me
(Funkity-funk, funk-funkity-air)
Too funky, too funky in here
(Too funky, funky in here)
Open the door y'all, give me some air
(Funkity-funk, funk-funkity-air)
Too funky in here

(Too funky, funky in here)
(Funkity, funk, funk up the air)
Too funky in here
Gimme some air
Too funky in here, hear me
Gimme some air

Doing it, say it, funky in here
(Too funky)
The air
(Too funky, funk up the air)
Gimme some air
(Too funky)
Body heat, body body body
(Too funky, funk up the air)
Body, body
(Too funky)
Dika dika
Now rock on from side to side
(Too funky)
Do your, do your, do your disco dance and...
(Too funky, funk up the air)Embed
