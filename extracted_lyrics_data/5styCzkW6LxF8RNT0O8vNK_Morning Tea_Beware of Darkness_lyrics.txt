3 ContributorsMorning Tea LyricsI think my mother died today
Or was it yesterday?
It’s hard to say
I found it odd when she never came
To bring my cup of morning tea
I think my girlfriend left today
'Cause I forget her face when she waved at me
It’s such a plain face
It’s hard to see
But I think her name was Grace
All I want to do is disappear
Into the darkness of my room
Come away
I am numb
You can be numb too
Disappear slowly
De-attach now
Slip into nothing
Nothing at all
I went to buy some tea today
But couldn’t understand
A single word
He said to me
I could hardly breathe
And I left without my tea
You might also likeI met my counselor today
She said you got the grades for a college degree
Academic life is the one you bleed
Your futures looking bright
All I want to do is disappear1Embed
