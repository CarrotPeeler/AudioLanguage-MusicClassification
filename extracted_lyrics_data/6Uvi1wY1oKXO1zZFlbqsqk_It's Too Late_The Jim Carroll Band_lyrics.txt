6 ContributorsItâ€™s Too Late LyricsIt's too late
To fall in love with Sharon Tate
But it's too soon
To ask me for the words I want carved on my tomb
I think it's time
That you all start to think about gettin' by
Without that need to go out and find somebody to love
It's too late
There's no one left that I even wanna imitate
You see, you just don't know
I'm here to give you my heart, and you want some fashion show
But it ain't no contribution
To rely on the institution
To validate your chosen art
And to sanction your boredom and let you play out your part

It's too late
You know, when they got nothin' to give
They only part their legs for what's negative
They're so decadent
Until their daddy's money from home's all spent
You might also likeSo I think it's time, 'cause it's too easy to rely
On worshipping devils and strangers in bed
Though they do get good drugs, and they do give good head
It's too late
You shoulda realized I was worth the wait
Ah, but you didn't hesitate
When he took you off, you let him seal our fate
So I think it's time
That you all start to think about gettin' by
Without that need to go out and find somebody to loveEmbed
