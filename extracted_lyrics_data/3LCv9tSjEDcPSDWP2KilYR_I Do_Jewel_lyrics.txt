2 ContributorsI Do Lyrics
We've been doing this war dance together
For sometime, I know
And treating love like a battlefield
And taking it slow
Will you blink? What do you think?
The union we propose is dangerous, I know

Love is a game until it's played
And if it's lost it can't ever be saved
We have heaven to gain and hell to lose
But the difference is up to me and you
So if you will, I will stop sayin' I won't
And start sayin' I do

But life can take a long time
If you make the wrong choice
Time sure seems to fly by
When I hear your voice
Mistakes are hard
I hope we find
The courage to believe
We will succeed
You might also like
'Cause love is a game until it's played
And if it's lost, it can't ever be saved
We have heaven to gain and hell to lose
And the difference is up to me and you
So if you will, I will stop sayin' I won't
And start sayin' I do

Well, our hearts are locked inside an iron box
We're both too afraid to reveal our most tender parts, oh

Because love is a game until it's played
And if you lose, you can't ever be saved
We have heaven to gain but hell to lose
The difference is up to me and you
So if you will, I will stop sayin' I won't
Stop sayin' I can't
'Cause if you do, I doEmbed
