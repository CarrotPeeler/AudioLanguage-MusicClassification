Rhyme Molesters
North East representing
One time, for your mind
Check it

Ey yo, I'm known for spending mines on a fresh three piece
And getting blown by nine dimes is the best release
Sipping these fine wines, grown from grapes in Nice
The King of Greece ain't bringing the peace
And certainly leaving your chief deceased
And see, I never be getting these hands dirty
I get flirty round my wife, we living the throws life but mine is certy
My mind and bodies rash and keeping the body and Bogaty stash
In every hell hole, I roll on every (??)
Having these head tops clean off with sharp 'chetes
Scranning spaghetti , cruising in Chevy's whilst extorting levy's
Importing heavy, 'caine change hands every day or so
The dough never comes slow when blow flow
The Don Scragjon mafioso, living so so
You'll never go getting a sight of my head if you was a go-pro
(??) fillers with bona fide killers
Who dice a dozen tough uns and stuff 'em nice into five chillers
It's Splints who keeps the 12 gauge pumped
And jumped from behind tents, shells dumped
Another chump slumped
A psychopath stalking broads on the cycle path
Been helping her getting his life on track and showing him to stifle his graft
Whacking a rat like ping pong, I'm King Kong
Drinking Perignon, wheres the twat to grace the long dong
Replace your thoughts and think on
Pour a drink on, you're looking distressed
Your checking your vest, before I test don't bring one
Catches snitches like Potter and Bummy
Blotter in my veins, holding the reigns of the sulphuric bone rotter
It's so pure I gotta, use it sparingly and warily
Aware of the consequence and the contents impairing me
A job for Splints, enjoying after dinner mints
Eating Beluga caviar from a golden jar that glints
A rich taste mobster, red lobster from the fair sea's
I kill for chilli chicken
This kicking, coming from fat key's
You might also like
Yo okay, listen
Yo

Bow down and say now, head into your master
Calling out a king is gonna bring about disaster
I'm cooking up a storm to reign it down upon you bastards
A race to put the pace and I'm the mutton dons of dastards
Steady stepping, give a fuck of who you're repping
We're here to break it down like Brittany in 0-7
I see you shaking now and your brow, you started sweating
And your phone you keep on checking cause you're shook up in my presence
So here's a lesson from the critter known as Splinta
I'm eating out of rubbish bags and lighting up a binja
You shitty little spitters give up, you're not about it
I'll make your Mum and Dad split up, then laugh about it
Relax around ya, blowing smoke out my apertures
A pro amongst the amateurs, my spirit animals Slazenger
A hold of the bars and still free, feeling the cold with no P
Realise something that ain't B, that ain't making no sense G
My inner voice it tells me, what was it worth?
As I think about the charges, that I incurred
That I remained undeterred, lick the crumbs out my fur
Rising up out the dirt, I throw a spanner in the works
I take your pain and your hurt but my brains so absurd
I spit flames on the verse and throw your whole game into reverse
Respect for trying but there's surely no denying when it comes to dropping bars
Well, I'm not the best of all time but when I flow, it's tidal
DJ spin that vinyl, keep it tight now lie low
Ain't no body that I know, has high hopes for this tri-toking
His minds dope and he shines potent
Divide rhymes like mitosis and no lie, I'll die showing ya's
So who's next, come bring your crews best and prepare yourself for a chin aptitude test
We're so persistent and defiant on a mission
So before you cross our path you better stop, look and listenEmbed
