Oh
Sweet dreams are made of these
Who I am to disagree?
I travel the world
And the seven seas--
Everybody´s looking for something
Some of them want to use you
Some of them want to get used by you
Some of them want to abuse you
Some of them want to be abused
Uuuh

Sweet dreams are made of these
Who I am to disagree?

Everybody´s looking for something
