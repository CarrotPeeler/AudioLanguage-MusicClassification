I am
Disintegrating
As I set fire (set fire)
To the
Life that I once knew
In my last stand (last stand)

To break free (To break free, to break free)
From the ghost of me (ghost of me)
I burn it down (burn it down, burn it down)
A past life to the ground, to the ground

A skyline's severance
Cleave from creation's hands
A skyline's severance

Dying
Seemed appropriate
For the old me (old me)
Living
Was so much harder
Lone and longing (longing)

To break free (to break free, to break free)
From the ghost of me (ghost of me)
I burn it down (burn it down, burn it down)
A past life to the ground, to the ground

A skyline's severance
Cleave from creation's hands
A skyline's severance

It hurts
So much to feel alive
To feel the tide
Breaking down, these waves will drown

It hurts
So much to feel alive
To feel the tide
Breaking down, these waves will drown

A skyline's severance
Cleave from creation's hands
A skyline's severance

Cleave from creation's handsEmbed
