The kids don’t call ‘em that but they’re go go boots alright
I was just a little boy the first time they come around
But my sister had her some and she wore ‘em up town
And she did the dirty dog and the boogaloo all night
Go go boots are back and I think that’s out a site
Lava lamps were fun but I never wanted one
‘Cause I had a little psychedelic thing of my own
Is it really any wonder that I never finished school
‘Cause I’m wanderin’ the hallways and I’m grinnin’ like a fool
And I never needed any kinda artificial light
But go go boots are back and I think it’s outasite
Wrap yourself around me like a circle ‘round the sun
Take me up the country where the crimson waters run
‘Cause the road goes on forever and a circle never ends
Everything that goes around comes back around and then
Mirror shades are in and I’m wearin’ ‘em again
They keep the mornin’ out and the mystery in
Quick - tell me if my eyes are brown or if they’re blue
‘Cause when you look inside all you’re gonna see is you
But you’ll know where I’m goin’ and where you been alright
And go go boots are back and I think it’s outasiteYou might also likeEmbed
