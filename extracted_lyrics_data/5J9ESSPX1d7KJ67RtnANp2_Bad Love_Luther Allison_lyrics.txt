1 ContributorBad Love LyricsIntro
Gone out every evening
Out to the pretty show
I ask her what was showing
She said I don't even know
Bad love
Bad love and never in
I'm getting sick and tired
Of all of this secred scenes
Came back in the morning
Her hair was all a mess
Her hips they was still shaking
She had on a different dress
Bad love
Bad love and never in
I'm getting sick and tired
Of all of this secred scenes
Came home no mooding lovin
She don't even know the reason why
I asked her why she was gone
And then she prompt right there and she start to cry
Bad love
Bad love and never in
I'm getting sick and tired
Of all of this secred scenes
SOLO

I'm getting sick and tired
Of all of that woman's secred scenes
