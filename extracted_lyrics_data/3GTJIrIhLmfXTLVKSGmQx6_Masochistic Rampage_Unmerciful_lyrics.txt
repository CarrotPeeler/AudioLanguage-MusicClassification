1 ContributorMasochistic Rampage LyricsNo recollection of any events from the night
Fake, numb reality
I sense evil, inhuman psychotic treachery
What did I do to thee?
Then I can see your body next to me
Face sewn to the carpet and hooks through your hands and knees
Art done so masterfully
I want to kill, masochistic rampage, slay
I attempt to contain myself, but drive a wedge through your head
Splattering brains and blood on every inch of your dominion, kill
Suddenly, all I see, your corpse laying beautifully
Artwork not complete, need a file to grind down your teeth
I slit groin to sternum, intestines call to me
I string your insides about the floor, excitement consumes me
Every single day I felt you suffocating me
You should've known I'd have my revenge
I unleash sheer ferocity, torturing your soul for all eternity
Although you're dead, ready for your grave
I'm not ready to bury you yet, I have needs that I must release
Your cadaver begs from between your thighs
Laying on your exposed chest cavity, crossing the lines of obscenity
I proceed yet
I inject pure wretchedness into your fast decaying bloody womb
Observing you, I now see the sutures ripped from your rotted flesh
Ruined art, simply trash thrown down the stairs like all the rest
Unavailing mass
You might also likeI've slit your groin to sternum, intestines called to me
I've strung your insides about the floor, excitement consumed me
I envision perfection, my canvas disappoints
I've strung your insides about the floor, it shall not end until it's doneEmbed
