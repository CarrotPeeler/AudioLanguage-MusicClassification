2 ContributorsThis Time LyricsLove makes us laugh
Love makes us cry
We're up and we're down
We don't understand why
But we take it
We're just trying to make it
Sometimes we lose touch
With our feelings inside
Put up our walls
When we injure our pride
And we break up
Only to make up
Easy
Love has never been easy
And I've been searching
Trying every door
'Til I finally found what I was looking for
And it takes what it takes
We all make mistakes
There are so many Mountains to climb
Bit I know that our love will survive
Baby this time
We heal from the pain
We learn from the past
The future is ours
Now we found it at last
We both know it
Can't help but show it
There were so many times
When the road got rough
Thought that we'd both had enough
But we kept it alive
Somehow the love wouldn't dieSee Curtis Stigers LiveGet tickets as low as $105You might also likeEmbed
