Dime (X24)
My girl is a dime

First of all let me say
What makes my girl a dime
Is more than what you see
And not because her body is fine
She stuck by me
When nobody will come around
She lifted me up
When I was down
That's what makes her beautiful
If I get out of line she let's me know
And she don't need no magazine
To help her build up her self-esteem
And what she wanna be touched it's only me
I'm back to fulfill her fantasy
This girl is a keeper
I swear I wanna keep her

My girl is a dime
Dime dime dime...
My girl is a dime
Dime dime dime...
Man I got a dime
Dime dime dime...

When I'm working on a job
I'm thinking about her all day long
And when I get catch a scent of her and
I can't wait until I get home
And before I can make inside
She's running to me arms open wide, cause I miss her, I love her, I let her know why, cause my girl is dime

My girl is a dime
Dime dime dime...
My girl is a dime
Dime dime dime...
Man I got a dime
Dime dime dime...

Girl you're so incredible stay with me
I will treat you right
Cause you're all I ever need
Won't never let go
Forever our love will always be
You are a perfect ten
And you made a man out of me

My girl is a dime
Dime dime dime...
My girl is a dime
Dime dime dime...
Man I got a dime
Dime dime dime...Embed
