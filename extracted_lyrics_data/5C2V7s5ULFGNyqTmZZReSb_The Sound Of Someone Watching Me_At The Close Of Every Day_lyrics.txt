1 ContributorThe Sound Of Someone Watching Me LyricsI kidnapped truth right outside your door
On the first date
You did not care or at least I thought
Was it worth the wait
It's allright
It's allright

That I was what you were looking for
I guess it hides in all of us
Is it worth the wait
It's allright
It's allright
It's allright
It's a perfect way to end it all
I hear the sound of someone watching meYou might also likeEmbed
