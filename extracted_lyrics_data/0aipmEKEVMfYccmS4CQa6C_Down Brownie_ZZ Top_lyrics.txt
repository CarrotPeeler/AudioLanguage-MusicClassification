2 ContributorsDown Brownie Lyrics
When I woke up this morning
Had a smile run across my face
My baby from town just had to get down
Come and drag me all over the place

Gone to drive on a flatbed trailer truck
Down on Highway Fifty-Nine
I had the blues and my baby, she knew
She's holding little piece of mind

Down brownie
My brownie downtown
Down brownie

Got my share and I'm a black
Hand cotton field
Just to try and keep myself alive
Eating red beans and rice
With the right sauce, it's nice
Or anything you want to try

Now I'm hitching a ride back from Brownie
I'm kind of sad but I feel alright
The cold night it stings
But I got me some wings
I'll be flying into Houston tonightSee ZZ Top LiveGet tickets as low as $68You might also likeEmbed
