1 ContributorLotus Eaters LyricsSpikey lady shiny queen
Don't you tell them what you've seen
Plastic people silicon
Never let them in your home
Don't become a middle man
Keep your mouth shut if you can
Don't you tell them what you know
They will go anyway the wind blows
Be my best friend be my baby
I'll be there for you maybe
Don't get on the roller coaster
Ya burn your fingers on the toasters
Just a fair weather friend
Gone when the summer end
They will look into your eyes
Tell you pretty perfume lies
Slinky slimy lotus eaters jeepers creepers
Get a load of those peepers
Talking all that mumbo jumbo
People pass in solo limbo
See them slip see them slide
But have you seen the nasty side
With all the smiling and kissing
Listen to the hiss hiss hissing
You might also likeShe slip she slide
She don't know why she hide
Dizzy little missy
With a twinkle in her eye bye bye
Finger lickin' good
Kill you if she could
Dig it when you're down
Send in the clown
Don't let them poke don't let them peek
Their friendly chat is cheap
You look so fine you look so hip
Your styling makes me trip
Take your place if they could
These are the people in your neighbourhood
She slips she slides
She don't know why she hide
Poking peeking sneaking cheating sniffing sliding
A running and hiding, creeping crawling
Feeling and mauling
Fickle little tickles
Brains like pickles
She slip she slides
She don't know why she hide
Dizzy little missy
With a twinkle in her eye bye bye
Finger lickin' good
Kill you if she could
Dig it when you're down
Send in the clown
She slip she slide
She don't know why she hide
Dizzy little missy
With a twinkle in her eye bye bye
Finger lickin' good
Kill you if she could
Dig it when you're down
Send in the clown
She slip she slides
She don't know why she hide
Dizzy little missy
With a twinkle in her eye bye bye
Finger lickin' good
Kill you if she could
Dig it when you're down
Send in the clown
She slip she slide
She don't know why she hide
Dizzy little missy
With a twinkle in her eye bye bye
Finger lickin' good
Kill you if she could
Dig it when you're down
Send in the clown
She slip she slide
She don't know why she hide
She slip she slide
She don't know why she hide
She slip she slide
She don't know why she hide
Dizzy little missy
With a twinkle in her eye bye bye
Finger lickin' good
Kill you if she could
Dig it when you're down
Send in the clown
She slip she slide
She don't know why she hide
Dizzy little missy
With a twinkle in her eye bye bye1Embed
