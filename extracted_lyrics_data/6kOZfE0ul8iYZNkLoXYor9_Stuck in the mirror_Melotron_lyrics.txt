1 ContributorStuck In The Mirror LyricsFeeling the rabbel
Oz met a girl upstairs, but she wanted
Do you know what happens there?
I can hear her
I can feel her
Rising sun was going down behind her smile
Her flaming lips - her killing style
I can see you, but I can't remember
What is love when I love to hate you?
We're still the same
We're stuck in the mirror
Where is heart when it hurts to love you?
We still in shame
We're stuck in the mirror
2x
The feeling rebel has died with a smile on the first floor
The last chance was stuck behind the red door
Behind the red door
Try to dance if you think it will help to forget
If nothing works go kill yourself now
Go kill yourself now and you will remember
You might also likeWhat is love when I love to hate you?
We're still the same
We're stuck in the mirror
Where is heart when it hurts to love you?
We still in shame
We're stuck in the mirror
