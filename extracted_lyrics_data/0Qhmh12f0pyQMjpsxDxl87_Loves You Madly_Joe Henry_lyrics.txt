1 ContributorLoves You Madly LyricsThe ground wants you back
The ground wants you badly
The ground wants you still
Like some lover, so madly
It pulls at your feet
Gets into your nose
Onto your bed
And under your clothes
Loves you madly
So madly
Madly
Loves you madly
The sun wants you deep
The sun has a need
To take you in then
Spit you out like a seed
The sun has a plan
You know nothing about
In the dark when the light
Of your heart has gone out
Loves you madly…
This floor has a lean
It gives to the side
Where marbles and water
Roll and collide
In the fashion of something
You think couldn't fall
The floor tricks your step
Throws you to the wall
Loves you madly...
You might also likeOh, God loves a sinner
God loves a crook
God loves you frail
And splayed out like a book
God loves you bent
And weck at the knee
When the lesser of you
Gets the better of me
Loves you madly…Embed
