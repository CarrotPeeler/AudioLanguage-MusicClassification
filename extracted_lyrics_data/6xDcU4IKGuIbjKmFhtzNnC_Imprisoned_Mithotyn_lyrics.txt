1 ContributorImprisoned LyricsOh, cruel destiny
Is this what you had in mind
Is this where my trail ends
I think back on what went wrong
Have I not done noble deeds
And been an honourable man
Behind these prisonbars I hear
The distant cries of a falcon
Riding the eternal winds
I long so to just breath fresh air
And to take a walk in the wild
Will I ever look upon the sun again
Chained to hunger and loneliness
Inside this filthy dungeons
I will see my son nomore
I wish not to be looked upon
Since I am not the man I was before
God of wisdom
God of knowledge
I now pray to you;
Save my soulYou might also likeEmbed
