5 ContributorsMake Me Believe Lyrics
Ain't no man to be found
I know you ain't B.S.'n
So just remember that I'm hip to the lip
Before you ask any questions
I ain't no young silly girl
So move out of your hard-rappin' world
You're gonna be downright in shame
If I find that you're playin' any games

Make me believe in you
(Make me believe in you)
Show me your love can be true
(Show me your love can be true)
Anything you want me to do
(Anything you want, I'll do it)
Just make me believe in you
(Make me believe in you)

Hey, I can't deal with temptation
You know it leaves me with no inspiration (No inspiration)
Another man playin' on me (Let's just play)
May have a hard time succeeding, you see (You don't seem to see)
You don't seem quite like the others
Which gets you respect from me, brother
But it will be awful, awful sad
To give love and you treat me so bad
You might also like
So make me believe in you
(Make me believe in you)
Show me your love can be true
(Show me your love can be true)
'Cause anything you want me to do
(Anything you want, I'll do it)
Just make me believe in you
(Make me believe in you)
Hey, hey, hey hey

Make me believe in
Make me believe in
Make me believe in
I need you to
Make me believe in
Make me believe in
Make me believe in
Make me believe in

So make me believe in you (Make me believe, hey)
(Make me believe in you)
Show me your love can be true
(Show me your love can be true)
'Cause anything you want me to do (Anything you want, anything you need, hey)
(Anything you want, I'll do it)
Just make me believe in you
(Just make me believe in you)
So make me believe in you
(Make me believe in you)
Show me your love can be true ('Cause I can't deal with temptation)
(Show me your love can be true)
'Cause anything you want me to do (It leaves me no inspiration)
(Anything you want, I'll do it)
Just make me believe in you
(Make me believe in you)
Hey, hey, hey hey

'Cause ain't no man to be found
I know you ain't B.S.'n
So when you come around
You just keep it real with meEmbed
