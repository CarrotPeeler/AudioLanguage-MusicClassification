1 ContributorMy Fellow Riders LyricsPleasantly removed
Into lush darkness
Into the dreamless place
I begin to sing this song
Staying loud enough
To drown out any noise
In presence of strangers
I begin to sing this song
It appears to be done
For the pleasure of the doing
But I'm no better shape
Than my fellow riders
Every now and then
I'm slipping back again
Empty and mortal
I begin to sing this song
My mind is moving fast
Trying to make connections
Taking short-cuts
Noting events
Listing all
Filing away
Along with opinions
Making connections
Taking short-cuts
Noting events
Listing all
Filing away
Along with opinions
Making connections
Taking short-cuts
Noting events...
It appears to be done
For the pleasure of the doing
But I'm no better shape
Than my fellow riders...You might also likeEmbed
