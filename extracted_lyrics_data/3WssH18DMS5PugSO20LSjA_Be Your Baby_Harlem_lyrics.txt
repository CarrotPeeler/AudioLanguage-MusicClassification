2 ContributorsBe Your Baby Lyrics
I just wanna be your baby
I don't mean maybe
I just wanna be your baby
And if I could be your darlin'
You gotta start fallin'
For all the bullshit I give you

Take a card from A to B
Play guitar from G to C
That's all about how much you hate me

I just wanna be your baby
I don't mean maybe
I just wanna be your baby
And if I could be your darlin'
You gotta start fallin'
For all the bullshit I give you

Take a card from A to B
Play guitar from G to C
Write a song about how much you hate me
You might also like
You call me up
At the hotel
Be in the van
I wish you well
I said "Hi, girl"
You said "With who?"
Do I change your mind or do I change my tune?

I just wanna be your baby
I don't mean maybe
I just wanna be your baby
And if I could be your darlin'
I just gotta start fallin'
For all the bullshit you give meEmbed
