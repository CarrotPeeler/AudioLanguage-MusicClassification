Robin, 
What is so rare as June in the air?
Summer is a comin' in
Old man goin' out fishin'
Puttin' worms in a tin
Look at him go so easy and slow
Summer is a comin' in
What's all the hurly-burly?
There's an oil, there's mighty queer
Could it be school's out early?
Could it be laughter I hear?
Feel a strange kind of stirrin'
Some thing's bound to begin
The world is dressed in her Sunday best
Summer is a comin' in
What is so rare as June in the air?
Summer is a comin' in
Look at him go so easy and slow
Summer is a comin' in
What's all the hurly-burly?
There's an oil, there's mighty queer
Could it be school's out early?
Could it be laughter I hear?

Some thing's bound to begin
The world is dressed in her Sunday best
Summer is a comin' in
Gee, I like to go fishin'Embed
