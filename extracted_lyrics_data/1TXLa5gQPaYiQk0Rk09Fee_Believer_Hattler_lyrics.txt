1 ContributorNew Masons Lyrics
Living life grinding on level nine
Lost in this feelin its not what i think it is
Sight covered by the night sky
And we all saw different
Calm and belligerent
I’ll tell you what it really is
Stars and oblivion
Scars, how we live again
Start to carve out the infinity
This was ours before anybody given it
Pile up the coal
Hit a match like
Mics be glowin low
No cold suppers in my camp sight
Alright, I've been on the go runnin laps like
Gunnin for the gold
No runner upper in my pack, aight
Still at it, spittin what I’ve written last night
Been flowin like a know it from a past life
Old soul, divine, flow Christ like
Shining out my own mind
No one matching how we bent light
You might also like
Adding fire to forge
Learn from those before
Watch em spire from the floor
Kickin with my shawty
She be lightin up my core
All this giggins lookin boring
I stay quiet and record, aye
Feeling this limitless
Spill out my fingertips
Dont need a reason
As long as there's willingness
Really we’ve been tearing down the brick
Re-building in obsidian
And leaving your’s eclipsed
I, I grab the mic

Open up my presence like a landmine
Get wide
Open up the crevice like a cat's eye
About to live another life because of Bandai
And I’m finishing this sentence with the last lie
Not mistaken when I demonstrate it
Oh man, have some ladies mad at who I fornicate with, oh
Use to count the stars but now I coordinate em
Wanna catch me mad but no I don't debate em
Why you prone to hatin?
In New Haven livin out a flick, feeling it
Ain't nobody taking hits for me,  all our own
Just Jeff and I inside the pic, I’ve been feeling this
Ain't nobody writing hits for me
So so alive you can die and live again
You could add you half, never be the dividend
Dancin on the glass, she’s been spinnin with the ceiling fan, get it fam
Pulled together cameras cause she said we can

Adding fire to forge
Learn from those before
Watch em spire from the floor
Kickin with my shawty
She be lightin up my core
All this giggins lookin boring
I stay quiet and record, aye
Feeling this limitless
Spill out my fingertips
Dont need a reason
As long as there's willingness
Really we’ve been tearing down the brick
Re-building in obsidian
And leaving your’s eclipsed
I, I grab the mic
Like there's something to kill
Clutching Valerian steel
Rockin my element
Got a problem I'm yelling it
Bitches don't act how the feel
Recognize real
Never a mask but a shield
Better get hands on the wheel
Swear I've been telling em
Shot out the sky playing Galaga
Shuttered but loving the chill
I’ll burn what I feel

I burn what I
I burn what I feel
I burn what I
I burn what I feel

I am the last of the samurai
Damned if i ever give up on my ways
Still stuck in this maze
Relevant stuck in a faze
That's irrelevant, fuck it I'm blazed
Aye
These lions are lying
I am trying, stuck in a cage
Reciting whats up on my page
Till i'm up on my plays
In this game
Where everything's different
But nothin has changed
While they're bluffin its nothing
Like it's something up in my brain
Changes the solution
The next stage of evolution
Cause if we learn to turn the page
Then we can stage a revolution
Can you taste the air pollution? I mean wavelengths
Got rappers switchin styles trynna save face
Even if they're hatin on my track, its still a pay-play
But I'm just frequent eatin up these beats, no time to say grace
Aye
Lord please surrender me
I got my piece defending
Rollin on my own I lock and load
And now there's ten of me
Its like i brought my friends with me
You know i got some enemies
An ever since they hated on me
I said it was them or me dummy
Mentality
Its funny, It’s fallacy
I’m stuck on all these drugs cause I'm numbing reality
I’m coming, and hell's with me
I brought my book of spells with me
These high elves with me say hear what the spirits telling me
Aye
Now let me center my chakra
Phantom, enter the opera
Ex-Anbu black ops on the vodka
Cause the mission isn't over till the end of the op huh?
I felt a lot of things in this game, it is not love
And that is not to be debated
I am not to be related to these non-believer haters
Please don't talk to me I'm faded
This is not to be restated
But I could take it
Break it down, then properly relaying

Break it down brick by brick then rebuild it
I could break it down brick by brick and then rebuild it
We could break it down brick by brick and then rebuild it
So lets break it down brick by brick then rebuild it
Oh
Red cloud through the sun rays
Morning star, dawning light, come in one day
Drinkin ham, wrong way down a one way
Broken hearts, lost souls on the run way
[Hook 2: ILL Silla
Addin fire to the forge
Learn from those before me
Watch em spire to the floor
Kickin with my shawty
She be lightin up my core
All this giggins lookin boring
I stay quiet and recording
Feeling this limitless
Spill out my fingertips
Don't need a reason
As long as there's real in this
Really we’ve been tearing down the bricks
Rebuilding in obsidian
Leavin your’s eclipse
I - I grab the micEmbed
