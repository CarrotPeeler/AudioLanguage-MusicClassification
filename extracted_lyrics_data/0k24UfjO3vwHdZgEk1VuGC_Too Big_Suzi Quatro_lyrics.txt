3 ContributorsToo Big LyricsSay
Sugar honey
You gotta act like me
You can take a passion lovin' panther
Make him weak at the knees
You can shake him like a rattle
And roll him like a dice
But honey you know I'm too big to be nice
I gave away my independence to all them evil guys
And when I got too hot they put my lips on ice
Now I don't hold out with wise guys
I see through their diguise
'Cause honey
I'm to big to be fooled twice
Well
I don't know all the answers
But I guess I know my share
And I've taken all the chances
But I never really cared
Because I'm too big to be used
You know I'm too big for my boots
You know I'm too big to be abused
And honey
I never lose
Now listen baby watch the way you walk
And when it comes to talkin; watch the way you talk
He'll tear you down and break you
And make you if he can
But honey you're too big too big for that man
You know he can't understand you

He's tried so hard to land you
Just send him back to school
Because you're too big to be used
You know you're too big for your boots
You know you're too big to be abused
And honey you'll never lose
Because I'm too big
To be used
You know I'm too big for my boots
You know I'm too big to be abused
And honey I never lose
