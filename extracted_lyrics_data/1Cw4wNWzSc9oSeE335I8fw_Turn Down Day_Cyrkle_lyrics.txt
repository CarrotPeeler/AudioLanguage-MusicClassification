7 ContributorsTurn Down Day Lyrics
It's much too groovy a summer's day
To waste runnin' 'round in the city
But here on the sand I can dream away
Or look at the girls if they're pretty

It's a turn down day, nothin' on my mind
It's a turn down day, and I dig it
There's nothin' easier I can do
Than lyin' around doin' nothin'
It's a turn down day, just a turn 'round day
It's a turn down day, and I dig it


Soft summer breeze and the surf rolls in
To laughter of small children playin'
Someone's radio has the news tuned in
But nobody cares what he's sayin'

Don't you know, it's a turn down day, nothin' on my mind
It's a turn down day, and I dig it
Things that are waitin' to mess my mind
Will just have to wait 'til tomorrow
It's a turn down day, just a turn 'round day
It's a turn down day, and I dig it
You might also like
It's a turn down day, nothin' on my mind
It's a turn down day, just a turn 'round day
It's a turn down day, just a turn 'round dayEmbed
