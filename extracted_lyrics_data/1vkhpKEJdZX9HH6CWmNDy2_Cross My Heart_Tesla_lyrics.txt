2 ContributorsCross My Heart Lyrics
Come on now

Well, I’ve been trying to call you, honey
Cause I know you’re all alone
Meanwhile I’m stuck in Albuquerque
While you’re taking care of home
Every time it goes to voice mail, can’t get you on the line
So I’m just sending you this message to ease your worried mind

I promise you my friend when we’re apart
I will be faithful to the end, cross my heart
I swear to you my friend right from the start
I will be there for you to the end, cross my heart

I see you tried to call me back wile I was up on stage
Sometimes I feel like an animal who’s locked up in a cage
As the days, the weeks, the months turned to years gone by
Too many bad excuses, baby, not even one good reason why


I wanna let you know
You are the only one, I’ll never let you go
You might also like + 

You know it’s true, babyEmbed
