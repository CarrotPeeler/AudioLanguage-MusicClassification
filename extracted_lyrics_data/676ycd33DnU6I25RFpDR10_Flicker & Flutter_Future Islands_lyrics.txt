3 ContributorsFlicker & Flutter Lyrics
You'll never know me, 'cuz you gave that up
And I was taken out with the trash
Taken out with the good
You're holding onto nothing, file me away
With all your broken dreams
'Cuz that's what you are to me

Take me out, take your ring
You gave to me and I lost
Between the seats
Take me out, take your ring
And everything you ever gave to me

You'll never know me, or crawl so slow
This place is my home, now moving too late
You in the lantern, flicker and flutter
Sigh in my chest hair, "Where are you going?"
And "When are you leaving?"
I'm leaving tomorrow. You can't stop me
Is that honesty? Is that enough for you?
It's enough for me. File me away
With your broken dreams
'Cuz that's what you are to me

Take me out, take this spider ring
You gave to me and I lost
Between the seats
Take me out, take your ring
And everything you ever gave to me

How's that for honesty?
How's that for honesty?
Take your ring...Embed
