A flashing star
A rag tag congregation is
Gathered at the bar
Searching for salvation for
Just an hour or two
While the jukebox in the corner
Plays the blues
It's midnight communion
Down on Second Avenue
They take the wine 'til closing time
A fellowship of fools
Confessions heard, forgiveness given
From twelve o'clock 'til two
Midnight communion
Down on Second Avenue
There's one old fallen angel who's
Lost the will to fly
But her broken wings still have the
Strength to hold you when you cry
Lord knows it's not the best place to
Lay my burdens down
But someone's always good for
One more round
You might also likeIt's midnight communion
Down on Second Avenue
They take the wine 'til closing time
A fellowship of fools
Confessions heard, forgiveness given
From twelve o'clock till two
Midnight communion
Down on Second AvenueEmbed
