1 ContributorDo My Thing LyricsNever said I was perfect but trust me baby I'm worth it
Connected in the circuit
I'm allergic to the circus
I'll curse you out in cursive to show you I got a purpose
Benihana money in the park n lot I'm eating church's
Whoever that I'm versus no mercy homie fonitó
They call me el fuegó this pure dope from a kilo
I get it off and reload stay, pray, and stay out the way
Broke this shit so many times I had to throw my heart away
They know me like Tim Hardaway
Back then I stayed with the heat
Prime timе like Deion but I'm in the fiеld without the cleats
Put ya money where ya mouth is boy I'm
Vic Damone Jr
What my money talk What
This is not a rumor
From match box to slap box to black Glocks
To stash spots with crack rocks the trap hot
Imma DO it till OD young OG that'll GO
Ten toes down all around by the G-Code
If death ain't involved ain't no need to be crying
If you sincere with ya faults ain't no need to be lying
You can't help em' if they don't help they self I stopped trying
Fuck a job I can still get work without applying
Got the heart of a lion I'm allergic to cowards
Probably hit a lick in Dade and blow the money in Broward
I said that  I'm allergic to cowards
Probably hit a lick in Dade and blow the money in Broward

Imma keep it real witcha I just pray you do the same
Make a little change now they claiming that you changed
I can't argue with a lame I'm just tryna
Do My Thing
The money come and go but the loyalty remain
Imma keep it real witcha I just pray you do the same

Do My Thang
So let me do my thang
Screaming out money ain't a thang
Top down switching lanes on a lame
So let me do my thang
Ya girl calling me like lil Zane
Phone blowing up I'm selling cocaine
So let me do my thang
I spit fire like dylon
Ball like zion
Stand up nigga you know the type you can rely on
After the ball hit the pylon I'm just tryna kick it
Ducked off with a chick fine like a ticket
I ain't been broke in a minute boy
Hour or second
The way I feel you the first to lose if you come second
You know the mamba mentality
Drug dealer salary
Drop em like a mixtape
Or I burn em like some calories
The money come and go but the loyalty remain
Imma keep it real witcha I just pray you do the same
Make a little change now they claiming that you changed
I can't argue with a lame I'm just tryna

Screaming out money ain't a thang
Top down switching lanes on a lame
So let me do my thang
Ya girl callin me like lil zane
Phone blowing up I'm selling cocaine
So let me do my thangEmbed
