3 ContributorsSunny LyricsSunny, yesterday my life was filled with rain
Sunny, you smiled at me and really eased the pain
Now the dark days are bright, and the bright days are here
My sunny one shines so sincere
Sunny one so true, I love you
Sunny, thank you for the sunshine bouquet
And Sunny, thank you for the love you've brought my way
You gave to me your all and all
And now I feel ten feet tall
Sunny one so true, I love you
Yeah!
Sunny, thank you for the smile upon your face
Sunny, thank you for that gleam that flows with grace
You're my star of nature's fire
You're my sweet complete desire
Sunny one so true, I love you
Sunny, yesterday my heart was filled with rain
Sunny, you smiled at me and really eased the pain
