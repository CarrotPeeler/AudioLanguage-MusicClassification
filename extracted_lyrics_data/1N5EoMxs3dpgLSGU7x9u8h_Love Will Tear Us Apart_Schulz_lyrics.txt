2 ContributorsLove Will Tear Us Apart LyricsWhen routine bites hard, and ambitions are low
And resentment rides high, but emotions won't grow
And we're changing our ways, taking different roads
Then love, love will tear us apart again --
Why is the bedroom so cold? You've turned away on your side
Is my timing that flawed - our respect run so dry?
[or in the Peel and Bains Douches versions:
Is my timing that flawed - have our feelings run dry?]
Yet there's still this appeal that we've kept through our lives
Love, love will tear us apart again --
You cry out in your sleep - all my failings expose
There's a taste in my mouth, as desperation takes hold
Just that something so good just can't function no more
When love, love will tear us apart again --You might also likeEmbed
