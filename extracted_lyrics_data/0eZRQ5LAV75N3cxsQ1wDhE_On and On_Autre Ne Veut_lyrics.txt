She's like a child
You won't know
Carry a light
But then you don't know what's worthwhile
Feels like this time is the place for me
Your faith goes on and on babe
This way goes on and on babe, on and on babe, on and on babe
Babe, babe, babe...
You won't know
Carry a light
But then you don't know what's worthwhile
And you said
"Feels like this time is the place for me"
Your faith goes
On and on babe 
Your faith goes on
Your faith goes on, on, on, on, on
And I love the way you make me think
Said push me harder baby baby babe

Love the way you make me think
Said push me harder baby baby baby babe
Said push me harder baby baby baby babe
Don't wanna make it that do that, eh
Um, um, um...
