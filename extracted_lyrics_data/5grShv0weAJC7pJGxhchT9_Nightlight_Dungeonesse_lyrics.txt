1 ContributorNightlight LyricsClose, tries
It looks good, he knows until he moves in light
I, try, to tell you everything
But never told you why
So we came, been satisfied
In the love way
It’s too, right
We never gets whole, I never get alive
Told you alright, and I told you bout...
We’re falling in love and we’re falling over
The plan is stay tonight, I can see your ...moving
And ... night, night, nightlight
Feels right
Night, night, night, I will fly
So right, right
You give anything you know I’m gonna quit goodbye
Why do I have, ...is it your love I need
I want you in my mind
So we came, been satisfied
In the love way
It’s too, right
We never gets whole, I never get alive
Told you alright, and I told you bout...
We’re falling in love and we’re falling over
The plan is stay tonight, I can see your ...moving
And ... night, night, nightlight
