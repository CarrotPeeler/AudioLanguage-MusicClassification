Ah, Ah
Ooh

Sunrise...
And the new day's breaking through
The morning...
Of another day without you

And as the hours roll by
No one's there to see me cry
Except the sunrise
The sunrise and you

Ah, Ah
Ooh

Tired eyes...
Drift across the shore
Looking...
For love and nothing more
See Uriah Heep LiveGet tickets as low as $94You might also like
But as the sea rolls by
There's one there to see me cry
Except the sunrise
The sunrise and you

Sunrise, bless my eyes
Catch my soul
Make me whole again

Sunrise
New day heed my song
I'm tired...
Of fighting and fooling around
But from now till' who knows when
My sword will be my pen
And I'll love you, love ya
For all of my time, yeah

Sunrise, bless my eyes
Catch my soul
Make me whole again
Sunrise, bless my eyes
Catch my soul
Make me whole again
Sunrise, bless my eyes
Catch my soul
Make me whole again
Sunrise...1Embed
