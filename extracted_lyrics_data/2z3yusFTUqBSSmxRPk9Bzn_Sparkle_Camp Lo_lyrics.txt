Sparklin'
Lo-a, Lo-a
Lo-a, Lo-a

Got the bubbly (Lo-a) pourin' through me (Lo-a)
Got the bubbly (Lo-a) pourin' through me (Lo-a)
(Sparklin') Bubbly (Lo-a) pourin' through me (Lo-a)
Got the bubbly (Lo-a) pourin' through me (Lo-a, sparklin')

Diamond runners, strangers in paradise
Hobo flats, sugar cane alley-scats, Lo in parade
With the Black Spades, Courvoisier spillin' on the rocks
Intoxicating the satin dolls with his private dance

And it don't stop 'til the midnight, this glass got me right
Only live Lo light, then drown in the Mo' Dom
On to the disco, Sisqo got me laced
Scorch a half a quart, then E&J get chased
Bronx vigilantes, call us big wheelers
Diamond crook avengers, Sheba doll stealers

Give me sunshine, dada, a twenty-one convincer salute
For the Africana, Midnight Express, how we do
Hold my razors, beaucoup, jiggas and figures of Coolie facin'
Shadow boxers, undercover faggot lovers
Dig my Satin Struthers, Coolie High way up in the sky
Throw in the fly, car wash bubble out
In a grandstand land, Goldie everyday
Sip the slick in the style, stick ya self, stick ya self, swap out
You might also like
Every district bring the mischief, sing the Sweetback
Blaze the skama, drop the rag, push the seat back
Diamanté catch reflect off the chrome rim
Private stock drenched me, I can't stop from bubblin'
Alley cat anthem, always bless the 'istol
Jungle Brown and C-Smoke complete the Lo official (Sparklin')

Got the bubbly (Lo-a) pourin' through me (Lo-a)
Got the bubbly (Lo-a) pourin' through me (Lo-a)
(Sparklin') Bubbly (Lo-a) pourin' through me (Lo-a)
Got the bubbly (Lo-a) pourin' through me (Lo-a)
(Sparklin') Bubbly (Lo-a) pourin' through me (Lo-a)
Got the bubbly (Lo-a) pourin' through me (Lo-a)
(Sparklin') Bubbly (Lo-a) pourin' through me (Lo-a)
Got the bubbly (Lo-a) pourin' through me (Lo-a)

Welcome to Chardonnay heaven, it's the seven layers of pleasure
My genuine draft with the Lo-a accurate measures
Precision on beats if your Camp is wanted wherever
I'm bringin' the rain, clappin' rhythms to stormy weathers

Bruh, kissin' to Quiet Fire, higher will get us lower
Starfish and Coffee diggin', riggin' in shattered lifers
We only jive talkin', razor keep cotton squawkin'
Blazin' the loose cannons on top of white diamond sands
Street corner symphonies spillin', course there's a lower twistin'
Brown Hornet keepin' it nappy, keeps on keepin' on
Curious shades of black gleamin' off the roof of the 'Ac
Don't know how to act, wildin' with a nonchalant pack
Slappin' the theives with the unbelieves that'd be
Shakin' your block with the six million dollar bot
Just stop the bloodclot tears, for years, we airtight
Another flight into the Fahrenheit, Harlem night
I'm shankin' your thoughts, keepin' the Lo blade sharp for life
It's a jungle masquerade and we forever stone trife

Now check out the con comin' from the island of ice
No contact with shiest bubblin' with Mr. Midnight
And talkin' the jive, flirt-acious with cases of slick
And shovelin' herb, hip-tone from Black Belt Jones
That Ebony junction that be the function, yo, dig it
Time to shake a leg, get up in the wind suga (Sparklin')

Got the bubbly (Lo-a) pourin' through me (Lo-a)
Got the bubbly (Lo-a) pourin' through me (Lo-a)
(Sparklin') Bubbly (Lo-a) pourin' through me (Lo-a)
Got the bubbly (Lo-a) pourin' through me (Lo-a)
(Sparklin') Bubbly (Lo-a) pourin' through me (Lo-a)
Got the bubbly (Lo-a) pourin' through me (Lo-a)
(Sparklin') Bubbly (Lo-a) pourin' through me (Lo-a)
Got the bubbly (Lo-a) pourin' through me (Lo-a)

(Sparklin') It's the Lo-a pourin' through me
It's the Lo-a pourin' through me (Geechi Suede)
It's the Lo-a pourin' through me (Sparklin')
It's the Lo-a pourin' through me (With the Cheeba)
Get the drizzy on, get the drizzy on (How we do it)
Get the drizzy on, it's the Lo-a (Sparklin')
Courvoisier, Alizé, uh
Yeah, get your drizzy on
How we flow, team, get the drizzy on
For the Tri-state, get the drizzy on
(Sparklin') Yeah
Get the drizzy on, get the drizzy on1Embed
