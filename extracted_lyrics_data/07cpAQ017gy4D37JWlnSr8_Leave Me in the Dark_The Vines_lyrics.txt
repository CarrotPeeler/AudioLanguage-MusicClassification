Crying at the moon
Everybody in a hurry
Without any clue
There is a feeling that I get around you
There is a feeling that I get alone, honey
They got no reason that they get to hurt you
'Cause everyone has got a right to live, honey
Leave me in the dark
Crying at the moon
Everybody in a hurry
Without any clue
Leave me in the dark
Leave me in the darkYou might also likeEmbed
