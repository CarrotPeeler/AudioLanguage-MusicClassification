11 ContributorsWith Our Love Lyrics
It's just a look
And it makes the boys quiver
Yes, it's the look
And now they remember

Had they forgotten
What this all means?
I think they want to forget
And they hope that this time
Not this time

I won't look
I've got other things to do now
I forgot what it was
I've got to get to work now
They set an example for us, I see it
It can happen to me too
And it didn't make any difference to us
But I forgot the trouble, that's the trouble
Forgot the trouble, that's the trouble
Forgot the trouble and that's the trouble
With our love
With our love
With our love
You might also like
They hear the words
Such as "You're really special"
And they can't face that feeling
And they can't really tell

And I look out the window, and I
I call that education, and I
I see all my friends standing out there, and I
I call that educationâ€”sophistication

They're not so busy that they
They won't be affected because
Things come and go and I see 'em, but I
I won't be neglected
Not this time

I won't look
I've got other things to do now
I forgot what it was
I've got to get to work now
They set an example for us, I see it
It can happen to me too
And it didn't make any difference to us
But I forgot the trouble, that's the trouble
Forgot the trouble, that's the trouble
Forgot the trouble and that's the trouble
With our love
With our love
With our loveEmbed
