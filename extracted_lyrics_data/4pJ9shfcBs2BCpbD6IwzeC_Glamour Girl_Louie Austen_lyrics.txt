Everyday After Work
I Go To A Book Store Around The Corner
I`m Going To Look in For The Glossy Magazines
About Fashion And Style!
And Hope You`Re Inside
Ummmm Hmmmm
When You Walk, I Feel Like Dancin`
All I Want, Is Making Love To You
When You Move,The World Gets Groovy
All I Do, Is Dream Of You
You Are Great, You`re The Top
You Are Grand, You Are My Star
