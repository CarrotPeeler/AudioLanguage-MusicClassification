6 ContributorsCrystal Days Lyrics
Here am I, whole at last with a golden view
Looking for hope and I hope it's you
Splitting my heart, cracked right in two

The pleasure of pain endured to purify our misfit ways
And magnify our crystal days

Where are you? In shadows only I can see
Looking for hope and you hope it's me
Tattered and torn and born to be

Building a world where we can purify our misfit ways
And magnify our crystal days

Pure and to magnify

Here am I, whole at last with a golden view
Looking for hope and I know it's you
Splitting my heart, cracked right in two
You might also like
The pleasure of pain and joy to purify our misfit ways
And magnify our crystal days
Purify our misfit ways
And magnify our crystal

Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
