1 ContributorMasquerade LyricsSitting here and reading your thoughts, my heart sinks once again
'Cause I caught you in another lie, find no truth in what you said
You say that you'll hurt my feelings
You say I won't understand
I say you're just a coward
Just a counterfeit friend
And all the times I've been there, they didn't mean a thing
At least not to you, but I know they meant something to me
And I wish that I could give up, is that what you want from me?
Because I'm still your friend even if you don't want me to be
My promises are haunting me, not so easily shoved aside
And yet I keep on trying to finally justify
Taking every single word back, every pledge I ever made
Because the friend I swore them to was nothing but a masquerade
And all the times I've been there, they didn't mean a thing
At least not to you, but I know they meant something to me
And I wish that I could give up, is that what you want from me?
Because I'm still your friend even if you don't want me to be
Then you ask if something's wrong
If only you could hear this song
You'd just make up some lame excuse
So it's no use (it's no use) listening to you
You might also likeAnd all the times I've been there, they didn't mean a thing
At least not to you, but I know they meant something to me
And I wish that I could give up, is that what you want from me?
Because I'm still your friend even if you don't want me to be
What do you do when you're not lying, do you have other words to say?
Why do I have to try so hard to keep from pushing you away?
I wish that I could give up, is that what you want from me?
Because I'm still your friend even if you've never been one to meEmbed
