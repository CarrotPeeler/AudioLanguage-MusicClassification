Baby, oh, baby
Boogaloo down Broadway (Broadway), yeah (funky, funky Broadway)
Baby, oh, baby
Boogaloo down Broadway (Broadway), yeah (funky, funky Broadway)

Come on Sally, come on Sue
All day long we're gonna boogaloo
But when the sweat begins to fill the air
We're gonna funky Broadway ev'rywhere

Uh, ooh
Baby, oh, baby
Boogaloo down Broadway (Broadway), yeah (funky, funky Broadway)
Baby, hey, baby
Boogaloo down Broadway (Broadway), yeah (funky, funky Broadway)

Come on, baby, it ain't hard to do
You've been doin' it ever since you were two
That's it, baby, now you've got the swing
Come on, baby, and shake that thing

Um, ooh
Baby, oh, baby
Boogaloo down Broadway (Broadway), yeah (Broadway)
Baby, wow, baby
Boogaloo down Broadway (Broadway), yeah (Broadway)

Everybody in your town
Gonna be boogalooin' and Broadway bound
So get your partner, get in line
We're gonna have ourselves a heck of a time

Um, ooh
Baby, oh, baby
Boogaloo down Broadway (Broadway), yeah (funky, funky Broadway)
Baby, heh, baby
Boogaloo down Broadway (Broadway), yeah (funky, funky Broadway)
That's it, baby, huh
You got the swing
Come on, baby
Shake that thingEmbed
