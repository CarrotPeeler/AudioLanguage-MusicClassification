FADE IN:
1 INT. BARBERSHOP--PARRIS
ISLAND MARINE BASE--DAY
Marine recruits having their heads shaved with electric clippers. The hair piles up on the floor.

2 INT.
BARRACKS--DAY
Marine recruits stand at attention in front of their bunks.
Master Gunnery Sergeant HARTMAN walks along the line of blank-faced recruits.
HARTMAN: I am Gunnery Sergeant Hartman, your Senior Drill Instructor. From now on, you will speak only when spoken to, and the first and last words out of your filthy sewers will be "Sir!" Do you maggots understand that?

RECRUITS (in unison): Sir, yes, sir!

HARTMAN: Bullshit! I can't hear you. Sound off like you
got a pair.
RECRUITS (louder): Sir, yes, sir!
HARTMAN: If you ladies leave my island, if you survive recruit training ... you will be a weapon, you will be a minister of death, praying for war. But until that day you are pukes! You're the lowest form of life on Earth. You are not even human fucking beings! You are nothing but unorganized grabasstic pieces of amphibian shit!
Because I am hard, you will not like me. But the more you hate me, the more you will learn. I am hard, but I am fair! There is no racial bigotry here! I do not look down on niggers, kikes, wops or greasers. Here you are all equally worthless! And my orders are to weed out all non-hackers who do not pack the gear to serve in my beloved Corps! Do you maggots understand that?
RECRUITS (in unison): Sir, yes, sir!
HARTMAN: Bullshit! I can't hear you!
RECRUITS (louder): Sir, yes, sir!

HARTMAN: What's your name, scumbag?
SNOWBALL (shouting): Sir, Private Brown, sir!
HARTMAN: Bullshit! From now on you're Private Snowball! Do you like that name?
SNOWBALL (shouting): Sir, yes, sir!
HARTMAN: Well, there's one thing that you won't like, Private Snowball! They don't serve fried chicken and watermelon on a daily basis in my mess hall!
SNOWBALL: Sir, yes, sir!
JOKER (whispering): Is that you, John Wayne? Is this me?
HARTMAN: Who said that? Who the fuck said that? Who's the slimy little commode of shit twinkle-toed cocksucker down here, who just
signed his own death warrant? Nobody, huh?! The fairy fucking godmother said it! Out-fucking-standing! I will P.T. you all until you fucking die! I'll P.T. you until your assholes are sucking buttermilk.

HARTMAN: Was it you, you scroungy little fuck, huh?!
COWBOY: Sir, no, sir!
HARTMAN: You little piece of shit! You look like a fucking worm! I'll bet it was you!
COWBOY: Sir, no, sir!
JOKER: Sir, I said it, sir!

HARTMAN: Well ...no shit. What have we got here, a fucking comedian? Private Joker? I admire your honesty. Hell, I like you. You can come over to my house and fuck my sister.
Sergeant HARTMAN punches JOKER in the stomach. JOKER sags to his knees.
HARTMAN: You little scumbag! I've got your name! I've got your ass! You will not laugh! You will not cry! You will learn by the numbers. I will teach you. Now get up! Get on your feet! You had best unfuck yourself or I will unscrew your head and shit down your neck!
JOKER: Sir, yes, sir!
HARTMAN: Private Joker, why did you join my beloved Corps?
JOKER: Sir, to kill, sir!
HARTMAN: So you're a killer!
JOKER: Sir, yes, sir!
HARTMAN: Let me see your war face!
JOKER: Sir?
HARTMAN: You've got a war face? Aaaaaaaagh! That's a war face. Now let me see your war face!
JOKER: Aaaaaaaagh!
HARTMAN: Bullshit! You didn't convince me! Let me see your real war face!
JOKER: Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaagh!
HARTMAN: You didn't scare me! Work on it!
JOKER: Sir, yes, sir!
Sergeant HARTMAN speaks into cowboy's face.
HARTMAN: What's your excuse?
COWBOY: Sir, excuse for what, sir?
HARTMAN: I'm asking the fucking questions here, Private. Do you understand?!
COWBOY: Sir, yes, sir!
HARTMAN: Well thank you very much! Can I be in charge for a while?
COWBOY: Sir, yes, sir!
HARTMAN: Are you shook up? Are you nervous?
COWBOY: Sir, I am, sir!
HARTMAN: Do I make you nervous?
COWBOY: Sir!
HARTMAN: Sir, what? Were you about to call me an asshole?!
COWBOY: Sir, no, sir!
HARTMAN: How tall are you, Private?
COWBOY: Sir, five foot nine, sir!
HARTMAN: Five foot nine? I didn't know they stacked shit that high! You trying to squeeze an inch in on me somewhere, huh?
COWBOY: Sir, no, sir.
HARTMAN: Bullshit! It looks to me like the best part of you ran down the crack of your mama's ass and ended up as a brown stain on the mattress! I think you've been cheated!
HARTMAN: Where in hell are you from anyway, Private?
COWBOY: Sir, Texas, sir!
HARTMAN: Holy dogshit! Texas! Only steers and queers come from Texas, Private Cowboy! And you don't look much like a steer to me, so that kinda narrows it down! Do you suck dicks?
COWBOY: Sir, no, sir!
HARTMAN: Are you a peter-puffer?
COWBOY: Sir, no, sir!
HARTMAN: I'll bet you're the kind of guy that would fuck a person in the ass and not even have the goddam common courtesy to give him a reach-around! I'll be watching you!

HARTMAN: Did your parents have any children that lived?
PYLE: Sir, yes, sir!
HARTMAN: I'll bet they regret that! You're so ugly you could be a modern art masterpiece! What's your name, fatbody?
PYLE: Sir, Leonard Lawrence, sir!
HARTMAN: Lawrence? Lawrence, what, of Arabia?
PYLE: Sir, no, sir!
HARTMAN: That name sounds like royalty! Are you royalty?
PYLE: Sir, no, sir!
HARTMAN: Do you suck dicks?
PYLE: Sir, no, sir!
HARTMAN: Bullshit! I'll bet you could suck a golf ball through a garden hose!
PYLE: Sir, no, sir!
HARTMAN: I don't like the name Lawrence! Only faggots and sailors are called Lawrence! From now on you're Gomer Pyle!
PYLE: Sir, yes, sir!
PYLE has the trace of a strange smile on his face.
HARTMAN: Do you think I'm cute, Private Pyle? Do you think I'm funny?
PYLE: Sir, no, sir!
HARTMAN: Then wipe that disgusting grin off your face!
PYLE: Sir, yes, sir!
HARTMAN: Well, any fucking time, sweetheart!
PYLE: Sir, I'm trying, sir.
HARTMAN: Private Pyle, I'm gonna give you three seconds--exactly three fucking seconds--to wipe that stupid-looking grin off your face, or I will gouge out your eyeballs and skull-fuck you! One! Two! Three!

PYLE: Sir, I can't help it, sir!
HARTMAN: Bullshit! Get on your knees, scumbag!

HARTMAN: Now choke yourself!

HARTMAN: Goddamn it, with my hand, numbnuts!!

HARTMAN: Don't pull my fucking hand over there! I said choke yourself! Now lean forward and choke yourself!



HARTMAN: Are you through grinning?
PYLE (barely able to speak): Sir, yes, sir!
HARTMAN: Bullshit! I can't hear you!
PYLE (gasping): Sir, yes, sir!
HARTMAN: Bullshit! I still can't hear you! Sound off like you got a pair!
PYLE (gagging): Sir, yes, sir!
HARTMAN: That's enough! Get on your feet!

HARTMAN: Private Pyle, you had best square your ass away and start shitting me Tiffany cuff links... or I will definitely fuck you up!
PYLE: Sir, yes, sir!

PYLE: Sir, no, sir!
HARTMAN: Then you did that on purpose! You want to be different!

Prepare to mount! Mount!

HARTMAN: Port... hut!

HARTMAN: Pray!
RECRUITS (in unison): This is my rifle. There are many like it, but this one is mine. My rifle is my best friend. It is my life. I must master it, as I must master my life. Without me my rifle is useless. Without my rifle, I am useless. I must fire my rifle true. I must shoot straighter than my enemy who is trying to kill me. I must shoot him before he shoots me. I will. Before God I swear this creed. My rifle and myself are defenders of my country. We are the masters of our enemy. We are the saviours of my life. So be it... until there is no enemy but peace. Amen.
HARTMAN: Order... hut!

HARTMAN: At ease!

JOKER: Sir, the private said "No, sir," sir!
HARTMAN: Why, you little maggot! You make me want to vomit!

DISSOLVE TO:
27 EXT. RIFLE RANGE--DAY

HARTMAN: The deadliest weapon in the world is a marine and his rifle. It is your killer instinct which must be harnessed if you expect to survive in combat. Your rifle is only a tool. It is a hard heart that kills. If your killer instincts are not clean and strong you will hesitate at the moment of truth. You will not kill. You will become dead marines. And then you will be in a world of shit. Because marines are not allowed to die without permission! Do you maggots understand?

INT. BARRACKS--NIGHT
The recruits in their skivvies stand at attention in two facing rows on top of their footlockers, arms outstretched, hands held rigidly in front of them, palms down, for inspection.
HARTMAN moves along the row of men. He smacks a recruit's hand.
HARTMAN: Trim 'em.
HARTMAN points at the feet of another recruit.
HARTMAN: Toejam!
To another recruit.
HARTMAN: Pop that blister!
HARTMAN stops in front of PYLE and notices his foot-locker is unlocked. He picks up the lock and holds it up to PYLE.
HARTMAN: Jesus H. Christ! Private Pyle, why is your footlocker unlocked?
PYLE: Sir, I don't know, sir!
HARTMAN: Private Pyle, if there is one thing in this world that I hate, it is an unlocked footlocker! You know that, don't you?
PYLE: Sir, yes, sir!
HARTMAN: If it wasn't for dickheads like you, there wouldn't be any thievery in this world, would there?
PYLE: Sir, no, sir!
HARTMAN: Get down!
PYLE steps down, from the footlocker. HARTMAN flips open the lid with a bang and begins rummaging through the box.
HARTMAN: Well, now .. . let's just see if there's anything missing!
HARTMAN freezes. He reaches down and slowly picks up a jelly doughnut, holding it in disgust at arm's length with his fingertips.
HARTMAN: Holy Jesus! What is that? What is that, Private Pyle?!
PYLE: Sir, a jelly doughnut, sir!
HARTMAN: A jelly doughnut?!
PYLE: Sir, yes, sir!
HARTMAN: How did it get here?
PYLE: Sir, I took it from the mess hall, sir!
HARTMAN: Is chow allowed in the barracks, Private Pyle?
PYLE: Sir, no, sir!
HARTMAN: Are you allowed to eat jelly doughnuts, Private Pyle?
PYLE: Sir, no, sir!
HARTMAN: And why not, Private Pyle?
PYLE: Sir, because I'm too heavy, sir!
HARTMAN: Because you are a disgusting fatbody, Private Pyle!
PYLE: Sir, yes, sir!
HARTMAN: Then why did you hide a jelly doughnut in your footlocker, Private Pyle?
PYLE: Sir, because I was hungry, sir!
HARTMAN: Because you were hungry?
Holding out the jelly doughnut, HARTMAN walks down the row of recruits
still standing with their arms outstretched.
HARTMAN: Private Pyle has dishonored himself and dishonored the platoon! I have tried to help him, but I have failed! I have failed because you have not helped me! You people have not given Private Pyle the proper motivation! So, from now on, whenever Private Pyle fucks up, I will not punish him, I will punish all of you! And the way I see it, ladies, you owe me for one jelly doughnut! Now, get on your faces!
HARTMAN (to PYLE): Open your mouth!
He shoves the jelly doughnut into PYLE's mouth.
HARTMAN: They're paying for it, you eat it!
HARTMAN turns to the recruits.
HARTMAN: Ready . . . exercise!
The platoon does push-ups.
RECRUITS (chanting in cadence)
One, two, three, four!
I love the Marine Corps!
One, two, three, four!
I love the Marine Corps!
One, two, three, four!

One, two, three, four . . .
While the platoon does push-ups, PYLE swallows hard to get down bites of the doughnut.

FADE TO BLACK
32 INT. BARRACKS--NIGHT
We see a towel on a bed. A bar of soap is tossed on the towel. The towel is folded over the soap forming a weapon. A hand picks up the towel-weapon and bangs it on the mattress making a dull thud.
PYLE is asleep in his bunk. The platoon silently slip out of their beds and form up around PYLE. A blanket is thrown over PYLE, each corner held down by a recruit, pinning PYLE to the bed. COWBOY shoves a gag in PYLE's mouth. PYLE is helpless. The platoon files past beating PYLE with the bars of soap wrapped in towels. PYLE's screams are muffled by the gag.
JOKER is the last one. He stands back from the bed.
COWBOY (to JOKER): Do it! Do it!

COWBOY (removing gag): Remember, it's just a bad dream, fatboy.

34 EXT. BLEACHERS--DAY
The platoon sits on bleachers facing HARTMAN.
HARTMAN: Do any of you people know who Charles Whitman was?

HARTMAN: None of you dumbasses knows?

HARTMAN: Private Cowboy?
COWBOY: Sir, he was that guy who shot all those people from that tower in Austin, Texas, sir!
HARTMAN: That's affirmative. Charles Whitman killed twenty people from a twenty-eight-story observation tower at the University of Texas from distances up to four hundred yards.

HARTMAN: Anybody know who Lee Harvey Oswald was?

HARTMAN: Private Snowball?
SNOWBALL: Sir, he shot Kennedy, sir!
HARTMAN: That's right, and do you know how far away he was?
SNOWBALL: Sir, it was pretty far! From that book suppository building, sir!

HARTMAN: All right, knock it off! Two hundred and fifty feet! He was two hundred and fifty feet away and shooting at a moving target. Oswald got off three rounds with an old Italian bolt action rifle in only six seconds and scored two hits, including a head shot! Do any of you people know where these individuals learned to shoot?

HARTMAN: Private Joker?
JOKER: Sir, in the Marines, sir!
HARTMAN: In the Marines! Outstanding! Those individuals showed what one motivated marine and his rifle can do! And before you ladies leave my island, you will be able to do the same thing!

35 INT. BARRACKS--DAY
Recruits standing at attention in two facing rows. HARTMAN walks between the rows, leading them in song.
HARTMAN & RECRUITS: Happy Birthday to you, Happy Birthday to you, Happy Birthday, dear Jesus, Happy Birthday to you!
HARTMAN: Today ... is Christmas! There will be a magic show at zero-nine-thirty! Chaplain Charlie will tell you about how the free world will conquer Communism with the aid of God and a few marines! God has a hard-on for marines because we kill everything we see! He plays His games, we play ours! To show our appreciation for so much power, we keep heaven packed with fresh souls! God was here before the Marine Corps! So you can give your heart to Jesus, but your ass belongs to the Corps! Do you ladies understand?
RECRUITS: Sir, yes, sir!
HARTMAN: I can't hear you!
RECRUITS: Sir, yes, sir!
36 INT. BARRACKS--NIGHT
The recruits are seated on footlockers, cleaning their rifles. HARTMAN prowls among them, watching.
PYLE talks softly to his rifle.
JOKER looks at him uneasily.
PYLE (to his rifle): It's been swabbed.... and wiped. Everything is clean. Beautiful. So that it slides perfectly. Nice. Everything cleaned. Oiled. So that your action is beautiful. Smooth, Charlene.

JOKER: Leonard talks to his rifle.
COWBOY keeps mopping.
COWBOY: Yeah!
JOKER: I don't think Leonard can hack it anymore. I think Leonard's a Section Eight.
Pause.
COWBOY: It don't surprise me.
They both go back to mopping.
JOKER speaks again after some silence.
JOKER: I want to slip my tubesteak into your sister. What'll you take in trade?
COWBOY: What have you got?

HARTMAN: You slimy scumbag, get on your face and give me twenty-five!
JOKER: Sir, aye-aye, sir!
HARTMAN walks to PYLE.
HARTMAN: How many counts in that movement you've just executed?
PYLE: Sir, four counts, sir!
HARTMAN: What's the idea of looking down in the chamber?
PYLE: Sir, that is the guarantee that the private is not giving the inspecting officer a loaded weapon, sir!
HARTMAN: What's your fifth general order?
PYLE: Sir, the private's fifth general order is to quit my post only when properly relieved, sir!

Woods. For the
first time the platoon marches in
full combat gear carrying rifles.

JOKER
(narration)
Graduation is only a few days away and
the
recruits of platoon thirty-ninety-two are salty.
They are
ready to eat their own guts and ask
for seconds.

43 EXT.
FIELD--DAY
In full combat gear and with fixed bayonets, the
recruits
charge through green smoke.
JOKER
(narration)
The drill instructors are proud to see that we

their control. The Marine
Corps does not want robots. The Marine
Corps wants killers. The Marine Corps wants
to build indestructible
men, men without fear.

44 INT. BARRACKS--DAY
HARTMAN talks to the
recruits formed up in a
school-circle.

of a
brotherhood.

marching band. Spectators.
Hundreds of marines parade by in dress
uniform.
HARTMAN
(voice over)
From now on,
until the day you die, wherever
you are, every marine is your
brother. Most of
you will go to Vietnam. Some of you will not
come back. But always remember this:
marines die, that's what we're
here for! But
the Marine Corps lives forever. And that
means
you live forever!

JOKER

HARTMAN
Jesus H. Christ, you're not a writer, you're
a killer!

JOKER
A killer, yes, sir!
HARTMAN
Gomer Pyle!

PYLE doesn't answer.
HARTMAN
Gomer Pyle!
We see PYLE
in close-up, now completely with-
drawn, barely able to answer HARTMAN.

PYLE
Sir, yes, sir!
HARTMAN
You forget your
fucking name? O-three-
hundred, Infantry. You made it. Perkins!

PERKINS
Sir, yes, sir!

The platoon
sleeps. JOKER walks slowly down the
squad bay with a flashlight.

JOKER
(Itarration)
Our last night on the island. I draw
fire
watch.
JOKER hears a muffled sound. He isn't sure where
it
comes from. He slowly enters the latrine.

48 INT. LATRINE--NIGHT

Running his flashlight across the room JOKER Sees
PYLE sitting on a
toilet, loading a magazine for
his M-14 rifle.
PYLE looks up at
JOKER and smiles. It is a
frightening smile.
PYLE
(strange voice)
Hi, Joker.
JOKER stares at PYLE for a few
seconds.
PYLE has quite clearly snapped.
JOKER
Are
those ... live rounds?
PYLE
Seven-six-two millimeter,
full metal jacket.
PYLE smiles grotesquely.
JOKER
Leonard .. . if Hartman comes in here and
catches us, we'll both be
in a world of shit.
PYLE
I am .. . in a world . . . of
shit!
PYLE gets to his feet, snaps his rifle to port arms,
and
starts executing the Manual ofArms.
PYLE
(shouting)
Left shoulder ... hut! Right shoulder ...
hut! Lock
and load! Order ... hut!
PYLE picks up the loaded magazine, inserts it
into
the rifle and smartly brings the rifle down to the
order arms
position.
PYLE
(shouting)
This is my rifle!
There are many like it, but
this one is mine.

49 INT. BARRACKS
HALLWAY--NIGHT
By now the platoon is awake.
HARTMAN bursts from his
room, wearing his
skivvies and D.I. hat.
PYLE
(offscreen)
My rifle is my best friend! It is my life!

HARTMAN
Get back in your bunks!
PYLE
(o.s.)
I must master it as I must master my life!
Without me ...

50 INT.
LATRINES--NIGHT
HARTMAN Storms into the latrine.
HARTMAN
What is this Mickey Mouse shit? What in the
name of Jesus H. Christ
are you animals
doing in my head?
(to JOKER)
Why is
Private Pyle out of his bunk after
lights out?! Why is Private Pyle
holding that
weapon? Why aren't you stomping Private
Pyle's
guts out?
JOKER
Sir, it is the private's duty to inform
the
Senior Drill Instructor that Private Pyie has a
full
magazine and has locked and loaded, sir!
HARTMAN and PYLE look at each
other. PYLE Smiles
from the depths of his own hell.
HARTMAN focuses
all of his considerable powers of
intimidation, into his best John-
Wayne-on-Suribachi
voice.
HARTMAN
Now you listen to
me, Private Pyle, and,you
listen good. I want that weapon, and I
want it
now! You will place that rifle on the deck at
your feet
and step back away from it.
With a twisted smile on his face pyLE
POintS his
rifle at HARTMAN.
HARTMAN look suddenly calm. His eyes,
his manner
are those of a wanderer who has found his home.

HARTMAN
What is your major malfunction, numbnuts?!!
Didn't
Mommy and Daddy show you enough
attention when you were a child?!!!

BANG!
The round hits HARTMAN in the chest.
He falls back dead.

JOKER and PYLE stand looking at the body.
Then PYLE looks at JoKER and
slowly raises his rifle.
JOKER
(trembling)
Easy, Leonard. Go easy, man.
PYLE breathes heavily, and Keeps the
rifle aimed at
JOKER.
JOKER is scared shitless.
PYLE looks at
JOKER for several seconds and slowly
lowers the rifle. Then he stumbles
back a few steps
and sits down, heavily on the toilet.
PYLE turns
away from JOKER and stares into space,
a strangely peaceful look
transforming his face.
He places the muzzle of the rifle in his mouth.

JOKER
No!!!
BANG!
PYLE pulls the trigger and blows the back of
his
head over the white tiled wall behind him.
