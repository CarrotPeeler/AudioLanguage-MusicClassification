4 ContributorsWorking With Meat Lyrics
We are desensitized
Television did not break me
Been broke since I was born
I'm breaking up with you

We are desensitized
Shove comfort up my nose
I feel dysfunctional
But numb enough for two

We are desensitized
I lost my only friend
Left here alone again
They left me here alone

We are the meat you work with!
This is your sense of failure
If you work me way too long
The failure stains your hands
We are the meat you've eaten!
Cut us with your sharpest knife
You've been away so long
The maggots eat away
You might also like
We are desensitized
Television does not hate me
Had hate for way too long
I hate you very much

We are desensitized
Shove comfort up my nose
I feel dysfunctional
But numb enough for two

We are the meat you work with!
This is your sense of failure
If you work me way too long
The failure stains your hands, aah! Aah!
We are the meat you've eaten!
Cut us with your sharpest knife
You've been away so long
The maggots eat away

We all are new wave faggots!
Digesting old drug habits
We've been away so long
The maggots eat, the maggots eat away, ohEmbed
