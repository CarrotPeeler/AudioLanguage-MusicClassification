However, in sleep I can't escape
A Coney Island high when I get inside
All I ask is please stay out of my dreams
Near the streets of Richmond and Hylan
Dwells the Princess of Staten Island
A seven dollar toll will get me in her hole
All I ask is please stay out of my dreams
Though long gone, she won't let me forget
When at night I wake up in her sweat
A lonely Brooklyn troll, a ghost of Red Hook old
All I ask is please stay out of my dreams
With your straight black hair and emerald green eyes
Hippies pointing, "That's Pete's sister in disguise"
Maybe you had uttered those words as a jest
I don't mind the allegations of incest
At the time I thought I could love no other
'Til I heard you say I was your brother
In your e-mail said how much we look like twins
How it turned you on just knowing it's a sin
Stay out of my dreams
Come on!
I said stay out of them
I said stay out of my dreams!
I said stay out of my dreams!

I said stay out of them
I said stay out of my dreams!
I said stay out of my dreams!Embed
