Children soften their parents' hardened features
Students busy buying presents for teachers
Wives cuddle husbands and playfully tease 'em
Poets write lyrics, some of which please them

I want a gentle, literate woman
Oh, a gentle, literate woman

A stone fells a bird only to stun her
Spring's allowed to stay for summer
Casting doubts away, I know it's time to find
My gentle literate woman, want to make her mine

I want a gentle, literate woman
I want a gentle, literate woman

People concerned about pollution
Got no doubt there'll be a solution
My gentle woman hears my pain
Once I meet her, I'll never be the same
You might also like
I want a gentle, literate woman
I want a gentle, literate woman
I want a gentle, literate woman
I want a gentle, literate woman

Fuck her from behind
Fuck her from behind
Fuck her from behind
Fuck her from behind
Fuck her from behind
Fuck her from behind
Fuck her from behind
Fuck her from behind
Fuck her from behind
Fuck her from behind
Fuck her from behind
Fuck her from behind
Fuck her from behind
Fuck her from behind
Fuck her from behind
Fuck her from behind1Embed
