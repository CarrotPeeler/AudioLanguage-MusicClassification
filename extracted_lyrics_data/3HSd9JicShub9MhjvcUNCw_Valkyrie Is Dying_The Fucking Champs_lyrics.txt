1 ContributorBillionaire Lyrics
I wanna be a billionaire so fucking bad
Buy all of the things I never had
I wanna be on the cover of Forbes magazine
Smiling next to Oprah and the Queen
Oh, every time I close my eyes
I see my name in shiny lights, yeah
A different city every night, oh, I, I swear
The world better prepare for when I'm a billionaire

Lights, camera, action, action, camera, lights now
I’m in the light now, everything is bright now
Happening right now, I just can’t believe this
Usually had to be asleep, so I could see this
No longer dreaming, this is my reality
Spotlight on me, burning like a calorie
Phone blowing up, can’t keep a full battery
Not only Keisha, Lisa, now Valerie
Girls throwing up they panties on stages
All the ladies naked, this is outrageous
Look into the crowd, so loud, so many faces
If it wasn’t for y’all, nah I wouldn’t have made it, huh
But by far, this is my favorite, lifestyle, anything I want, I’d get it right now
Uh, so let me pick up the mic now
Lights camera action, action camera lights, now
You might also like
Everytime I close my eyes
I see my name in shiny lights, yeah
A different city every night, oh, I, I swear
The world better prepare for when I'm a billionaire

Uh, but now it’s time to be real
I never made it, I’m in the streets still
Saving sweet tea cups, just to get a refill
Covered in blankets, can’t pay my heat bill
But we gonna make it, I promise we will
Gotta be patient, can’t take just an e-bill
‘Cause in the long run, it’s all business
It’s sad, but we gon get it
They doubt, but I can feel it
I know that I’m the realest
It shows when I be spitting it
So I be giving it a billion and ten percent
Until the whole fucking world is listening
Look into my eyes, you’ll see the stars glistening
All eyes on me, I hope you all witnessing
Castro you don’t know, then don’t mention it
Getting closer with everything that I write down
Lights camera action, action camera lights, now
I wanna be a billionaire so fucking bad
Buy all of the things I never had
I wanna be on the cover of Forbes magazine
Smiling next to Oprah and the Queen
Oh, every time I close my eyes
I see my name in shiny lights, yeah
A different city every night, oh, I, I swear
The world better prepare for when I'm a billionaire

Yeah man it’s crazy dawg I been, I been doing this shit basically all my life for real, and, everybody’s always coming up to me telling me different shit, saying I’m good, saying I’m wack, but I just learned to block all that shit out and just do me. And you know, now, I see myself, I’m actually heading to the top, and it’s a beautiful feeling. So, I just wanna let you guys know out there, never stop chasing your dreams

I wanna be a billionaire, so fucking badEmbed
