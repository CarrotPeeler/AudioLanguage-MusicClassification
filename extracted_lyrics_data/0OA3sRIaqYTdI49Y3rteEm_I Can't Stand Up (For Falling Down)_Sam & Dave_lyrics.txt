4 ContributorsI Canâ€™t Stand Up For Falling Down Lyrics
I'm the living result
Of a man, ooh that's been hurt a little too much
And I've tasted, uh huh, the bitterness of my own tears
Sadness, listen to this, is all my lonely heart can feel

I can't stand up for falling down
I can't stand up for falling down

Simple that love is
Yet it confused me
Why I'm not loved, oh yeah, the way I should be
Listen, I've lived with heartaches
And I've roomed with fear
I've dealt with despair
And I've wrestled with tears

Oh I can't stand up for falling down
I can't stand up for falling down

The vow we made, oh yeah
You broke it in two
But that don't stop Sam and Dave from loving you
You might also like
I can't stand up for falling down
I can't stand up for falling downEmbed
