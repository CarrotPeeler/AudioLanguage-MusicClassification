Hmmmmm, hmmmm
Hmmmmmm
(Caught up) In the middle and I know I'm trippin (know I'm trippin, yeah)
(Caught up) Everytime I say I won't I always get this (Ohhhhhh)
(Caught up) Somebody help me out, I'm fallin
I'm lovin two and it's gettin the best of me...
How can I chose when both of them are what I need?
Searchin for an answer, let me know (let me know)
What is the price to pay for ignoring the rules?
What do I do when I, I have to play the fool?
I need to find an answer, what I need (what I need)

Don't wanna break it off with either one of them
And still I just don't know, I don't know (I don't know)

Can't live a lie
Cause time always reveals the truth
This needs to stop cause I, I got too much to lose
Knew that this could happen, oh I knew (oh I knew)
