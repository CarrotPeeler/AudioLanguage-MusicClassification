2 ContributorsThe Way I Made You Feel Lyrics
It started when I was cleaning dishes
And the phone rang in the hall
I was drawn to it against my wishes
Ugly memories of the war

I didn’t count on mass destruction
When I saw you
Was the way I made you feel
I hadn’t seen such mass destruction
‘til I saw you
Was the way I made you feel

Went to town past the old café
That existed to service the highway
And what they were saying for all these years was true
They never were good old days as such

I didn’t count on mass destruction
When I saw you
Was the way I made you feel
I hadn’t seen such mass destruction
‘til I saw you
It was the way I made you feel
It was the way I made you feel
It was the way I made you feel
You might also like

I hadn’t seen such mass destruction
‘til I saw you
It was the way I made you feel
I didn’t count on mass destruction
When I saw you
It was the way I made you feel
It was the way I made you feel
It was the way I made you feel
