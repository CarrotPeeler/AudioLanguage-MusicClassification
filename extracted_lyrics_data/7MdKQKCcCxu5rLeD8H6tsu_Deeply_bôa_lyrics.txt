10 ContributorsDeeply Lyrics
Darling, I gotta talk to you
About the things you've been putting me through now
I gotta talk to you, I've gotta be explained to
Yea, yeah
Hey, yeah

Feelings, they're really burning low
They're burning higher than they've ever done before
I need to talk to you, I need to feel it deeply
Your actions now, they're really driving me
Driving me into a deep bed of insanity
You need to talk to me, you need to feel it deeply
Yea, yeah
Yea, yeah

Don't be afraid to say it, don't be afraid to say it
The words that you might tell me could never hurt me, oh no

I've gotta feel it, I've gotta feel it
I've gotta feel it deeply, deeply, now
I've gotta feel it, I've gotta feel it
And the words come tumbling from me
Feelings...
You might also like
Feelings, they're really burning low
They're burning higher than they've ever done before
I need to talk to you, I need to feel it deeply
Sometime now you're gonna come 'round
To the way that I been feeling about you now
I gotta talk to you, I gotta be explained to
Yea, yeah
Hey, yeah (I'm mad now)

Don't be afraid to say it, don't be afraid to say it
The words that you might tell me could never hurt me, oh no

I've gotta feel it, I've gotta feel it
I've gotta feel it deeply, deeply, boy
I've gotta feel it, I've gotta feel it
And the words come tumbling from me

Don't be afraid to say it, don't be afraid to say it
The words that you might tell me could never hurt me, oh no

I've gotta feel it, I've gotta feel it
I've gotta feel it deeply, deeply, now
I've gotta feel it, I've gotta feel it
And the words come tumbling from me
Oh, whoa, whoa
Oh, whoa, whoa
Oh, whoa, whoa-oh-oh whoa-oh...
Oh, whoa, whoa
Oh, whoa, whoa
Oh, whoa, oh, whoa...4Embed
