3 ContributorsYou Gotta Make It Through the World Lyrics

Well, let them take you for a clown
And they're bound to bring you down
You gotta make it through the world if you can
Think they're doing you wrong
But you got here on your own
You gotta make it through the world if you can

I said if you can, if you can
You gotta make it through the world if you can
I said if you can, oh, if you can, Lord
You gotta make it through the world if you can

Well, you know without a doubt
Nobody know you when you're down and out
You gotta make it through the world if you can
Well, talk about wrong and right
You've gotta make up your own mind
You gotta make it through the world if you can

I said if you can, Lord (If you can), if you can (If you can)
You gotta make it through the world if you can (If you can)
I said if you can (If you can), well, if you can (If you can)
You gotta make it through the world if you can (If you can)
You might also like
Yeah, let them take you for a clown
They will surely put you down
You gotta make it through the world if you can (If you can)
Everybody talk about wrong and right
You gotta make up your own mind about it
You gotta make it through the world if you can (If you can)

Oh, if you can (If you can), yeah, if you can (If you can)
You gotta make it through the world if you can (If you can)
Yeah, if you can (If you can), if you can (If you can)
You gotta make it through the world if you can (If you can)
Yeah, I said if you can (If you can), Lord, if you can (If you can)
You gotta make it through the world if you can (If you can)

I said you gotta make it through the world if you can (If you can)
I said you gotta make it through the world if you can (If you can)
I said you gotta make it through the world if you can (If you can)
You gotta make it through the world if you can (If you can)

Make it through the world (You gotta make it through the world)
Make it through the world (If you can)
Make it through the world (You gotta make it through the world)
Make it through the world (If you can)
Make it through the world (You gotta make it through the world)
Make it through the world (If you can)Embed
