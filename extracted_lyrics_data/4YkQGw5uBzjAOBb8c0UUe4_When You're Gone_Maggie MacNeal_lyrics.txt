2 ContributorsWhen Youâ€™re Gone Lyrics
I never had another lover
It was you who did discover
How to really touch my heart

Now you are telling me you're going
When my love for you is showing
We should never be apart

So please don't turn your back upon me
Without your love I die slowly
You have taken half my life

Every step I do for you, love
Every move is born of true love
It's a dream I won't survive

'Coz when you're gone
It's not of any use that I go on
That's understood
Don't leave me alone
The stars won't twinkle in the sky no more
The tree will lose it's bloom
The birds won't sing their song
The birds won't sing their song
You might also like
When I take your hand
I'll feel my love for you
Will never end or disappear
Please understand, I am near
Love is beautiful, love is dear when you're here

If you stay with me I promise
I'll tell the world about us
I'll sing your favorite songs
I'll make you dream a dream forever
Bring your flowers
'Til you surrender
I'll prove my love is strong

'Coz when you're gone
It's not of any use that I go on
That's understood
Don't leave me alone
The stars won't twinkle in the sky no more
The tree will lose it's bloom
The birds won't sing their song

'Coz when you're gone
It's not of any use that I go on
That's understood
Don't leave me alone
The stars won't twinkle in the sky no more
The tree will lose it's bloom
The birds won't sing their songEmbed
