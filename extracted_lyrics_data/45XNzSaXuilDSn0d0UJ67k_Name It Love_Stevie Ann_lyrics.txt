1 ContributorName It Love LyricsI walk back home
Where I wanna be
So damn sure that it wasn't me
Who needed some time alone
Now I run from every voice I hear
And I scream well there ain't no fear
Now I cry
I cry
I need some time
It took some time to rehearse a while
When I see we're getting
We held to be daring
To break the ice
Maybe I'll tell you all my dreams and stuff
And you can break them
With your bare hands
And then we fly
Yeah we fly
Our secret mile
Then I know
Yeah then I know what's on my mind
It's a long dream
I'd rather not have
But It got stuck in my mind
Name it love or faking roses
Or anything you please
But you're all I want for now
I met you under a darkened sky
And I knew it was just a matter of time
Before you'd, you'd heat me up
I thought I'd better leave you now
Instead of waited till my heart comes out
Then I fought
I fought
A major horizon
Then I found
Yeah I found a way to act wiser
Yeah it's a long dream
I'd rather not have
But it got stuck in my mind
Name it love or faking roses
Or anything he plays
But you're all I want for now
Yeah you're all I want for nowYou might also likeEmbed
