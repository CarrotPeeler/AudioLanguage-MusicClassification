1 ContributorSweet Oochie Poo LyricsI wanta sex you
Sex me sex me
Give it all
When ever I call
Until the day I fall
Is that all we talk about
Even coming out of my mouth
I wanta sex you
My sweet cuchie woo
Give me that sweet oochie poo
Lick that smooth toody
That's what everybody about
Rapping, singing about doing it on somebody couch
In the park, cars and the house
Putting whwer you pee, where they do a two in your mouth
Wild things!
Nobody that clean
Ding Ding!
Your light bulb needs energy
Maybe it was too dark and you couldn't see
You say love is the key
Your putting your mouth on her cherryrare
And your lipx on her assiair
I wanta sex you
Eating that b boo
Sucking that p yew
Give it all
Whever I call
Until the day I fall
Poisoning my body and soul
With all that delicious gold
I wanta sex you
My sweet cuchie woo
Give me that sweet oochie poo
Let me touch that booty woody
Lick that smooth toody
We love to copulate
And that's ok
Yes we are some sick mothersucker
Here is proof for the record
It's nature to copulate
Have you ever seem a dog masturbate
Maybe a monkey or two
They just as sick as you
We call ourselves intelligent
Cause we live in a house in pay rent
Maybe I ain't making sense
Doctor say it's ok to experiment
Sexing yourself is fine
I wanta sex you
Sex me sex me girl
Give it all
Whenever I call
Until the day I fall
Guess if your tongue was long
Be ok to kiss from behing
Shit yeh, I am outa my mind
Completely insane
Twice been Bang bang
Being overtax
Way beyond the max
One day gotta expire
Force to retire
Too old to get hire
Could be why everybody sexing
Having a good night of necking
Something to talk about
When we got oochie poo in our mouth
And booty woody on our couch
No toody
On our noody
I wanta sex you
Sex me sex me girl
I will eat out your b boo
Sucking out that p yew
Give it all
Until the day I call
Please callYou might also likeEmbed
