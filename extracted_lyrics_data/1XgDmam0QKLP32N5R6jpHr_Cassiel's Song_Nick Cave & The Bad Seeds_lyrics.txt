We've come to bring you home
Haven't we, Cassiel?
To cast aside your loss and all your sadness
And shuffle off that mortal coil and mortal madness
For we're here to pick you up and bring you home
Aren't we, Cassiel?
It's a place where you did not belong
Were time itself was mad and far too strong
Where life leapt up laughing and hit you head on
And hurt you, didn't it hurt you, Cassiel?

While time outran you and trouble flew toward you
And you were there to greet it
Weren't you, foolish Cassiel?
But here we are, we've come to call you home
And here you'll stay never more to stray
Where you can kick off your boots of clay
Can't you, Cassiel?

For death and you did recklessly collide
And time ran out of you
And you ran out of time
Didn't you, Cassiel?
And all the clocks, in all the world
May this once just skip a beat in memory of you
Then again those damn clocks, they probably won't
Will they, Cassiel?
One moment you are there and then strangely you are gone
But on behalf of all of us here we are glad to have you home
Aren't we, dear Cassiel?See Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds LiveGet tickets as low as $59You might also likeEmbed
