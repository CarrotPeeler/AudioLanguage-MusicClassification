14 ContributorsTorn to Pieces Lyrics
Out to find the truth
Behind the myth of
Man eating man
Finding bodies tied
Up to a stake
You cannot understand

Whoa
Filled with ignorance
You watch them eat your friends
Ask for evidence
A hook right through your tits

Torn to pieces
Torn to pieces
Torn to pieces
Torn to pieces

Trying to escape
They torture you by
Cutting off your cock
When you're dead
They'll feast upon your flesh
Your brains they'll eat and chop
You might also like
Whoa
Pray if you want
Pathetic rancid cunt
Face reality
Death your final pleasure

Torn to pieces
Torn to pieces
Torn to pieces
Torn to pieces



Torn to pieces
Torn to pieces
Torn to pieces
Torn to piecesEmbed
