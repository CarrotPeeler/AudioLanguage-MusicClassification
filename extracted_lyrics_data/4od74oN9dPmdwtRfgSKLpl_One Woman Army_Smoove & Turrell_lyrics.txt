1 ContributorOne Woman Army Lyrics(One, two, one, two, three, and...)
She got the money, dripping gold like honey
Got the claws to match to drag you back
Ain’t nothing gonna - stop her
One woman army of Gucci and Armani
Circuits not right, she loves to fight
And then go out and party
Oh I should have given you up
Oh I should have given you up
False beauty queen, change in a limousine
In rented dress, the girl's no mess
The camera seems to - love her
A twisted mind, beauty intertwined
From the belly of the beast, there’s no release
Ain’t nothing gonna stop her
Oh I should have given you up
Oh I should have given you up
No one can deny
That the girl's a wicked lie
But she’s my lie
People always talking
Say this boy should just be walking
But it’s my life
That the girl is just a tramp
Watch your money and your back
It’s a gold trap
If you don’t then you will fall
That’s the beauty of it all
This is real life
You might also likeShe loves a white line, even through the daytime
Y’all have no doubt, the girls got clout
She always gets her - own way
A broken doll, feelings they are gone
If she stamps her feet, you best retreat
Then run yourself the wrong way
Oh I should have given you up
Oh I should have given you up
Now, now, now
Oh I should have given you up
Oh I should have given you up
Now, now girl
Oh I should have given you up
Oh I should have given you up
Now, now girl
Oh I should have given you up
Oh I should have given you upEmbed
