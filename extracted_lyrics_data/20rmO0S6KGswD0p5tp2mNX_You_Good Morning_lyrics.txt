Hey you
You can't ever please everyone that pleases you
You don't have to put on a face and keep it all day through
Oh, you

But when you smile
Well, the legend lives on for a while
'Least there's dust in my eyes

Oh, you
You don't have to hide away on your own for a point to prove
'Cause if you say hide, then baby, know I'll hide with you
Oh, you

When you act like a child
Well, the legend lives on for a while
'Least there's dust in my eyes
Eyes

Hey you
You're not the only one who needs something to do
Sometimes you have to see another point of view
Oh, you
You might also like
Every time we get high
Well, the legend lives on for a while
'Least there's dust in my eyes
