1 ContributorOver the Valley LyricsOver the valley
I saw a silver cloud
With a pink lining
I said it right out loud
There's no denying
You are my one and only love
And we'll see over the valley
The moon rise above
Over the valley
This house among the trees
Where we've been hiding
Making our memories
And I'm deciding
You are my one and only love
And we'll be over the valley
As the moon shines above
The autumn breezes carry all the bluebirds
Down to where the sun still shines
If we could hold this day
In our hearts some way
We would never roam
Ever far from home
Over the valley
Just above the fray

And when we're old and grey
I'll still be betting
You are my one and only love
And over the valley
The moon shines above
The autumn breezes carry all the bluebirds
Down to where the sun still shines
If we could hold this day
In our hearts some way
We would never roam
Ever far from home
Over the valley
Just above the fray
The sun is setting
And when we're old and grey
I'll still be betting
You are my one and only love
And we'll live over the valley
You'll always be with me
As the moon shines aboveEmbed
