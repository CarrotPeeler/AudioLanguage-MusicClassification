1 ContributorWrite It All Down For You LyricsWell I'll write it all down for you
Bitter tea, bitter tune, bitter you
Well you sow what you sow what you say
Still you killed her when you came
And why, why would you kill this world my son
And why, why would leave it all for none
Why would these words have claim upon you
Put the pills in the tears in the truth
Well you sow what you sow what you say
Still you killed her when you came
And why, why would you kill this world my son
And why, why yould you leave it all for none
But the world, well is stands beneath those stars
Well I'll write it all down for you
Bitter tea, bitter tune, bitter you
Well you sow what you sow what you say
Still you killed her when you came
And why, why would you kill this world my son
And why, why would you leave it all for none
But the world, well stands beneath your scarsYou might also likeEmbed
