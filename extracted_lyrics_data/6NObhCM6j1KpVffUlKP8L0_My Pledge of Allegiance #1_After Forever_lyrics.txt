5 ContributorsMy Pledge of Allegiance, Pt. 1 - The Sealed Fate LyricsShe kept her beauty concealed behind a curtain of suspense
And endures her fate, molded by an ancient culture
The honour wasn't allowed to be injured
She is going to live as her community expects her to
I find myself confined between furtive desires and feelings of guilt
The letter:
These are my last words, I'm gonna leave you
I can't stand your narrow mindedness any longer
Forgive me...You might also likeEmbed
