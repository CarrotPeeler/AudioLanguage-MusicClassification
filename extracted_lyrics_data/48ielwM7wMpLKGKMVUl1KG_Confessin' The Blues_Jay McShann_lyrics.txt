1 ContributorConfessinâ€™ the Blues (1997) Lyrics
Baby, here I stand before you with my heart in my hand
I want you to read it mama, hopin' that you'll understand
Well baby, please don't dog me around
Well I'd rather love you pretty baby
More than anyone else I know in town

Because you so nice and loving
And you have such pleasing ways
Take me to your home, be there the rest of my days
That's the truth mama, well you know I wouldn't lie
Honey, I declare I wouldn't lie
'Cause if I don't love you baby, I swear I hope I die

Well baby, don't you want a man like me?
Well baby, don't you want a man like me?
Just think about your future
Forget about your used-to-be


Now when my days are long and dreary
And the sun refuse to shine
I never be blue and lonely
If I knew that you were mine
Well baby, won't you make everything alright?
It's gonna be today baby
Gonna be tomorrow night
You might also like
This is my confession mama
And I'm thrilled by all your charms
Now you know that I'm in heaven
When you hold me in your arms
Well baby, woman can I have you for myself
You were meant to be my woman
Well I don't want nobody else
Oh yeah, I sure don't want nobody elseEmbed
