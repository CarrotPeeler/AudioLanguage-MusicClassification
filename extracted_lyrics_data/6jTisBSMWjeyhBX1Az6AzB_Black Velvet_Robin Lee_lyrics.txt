Mississippi in the middle of a dry spell
Jimmie Rodgers on the Victrola up high
Mama's dancin', baby on her shoulder
The sun is settin' like molasses in the sky

The boy could sing, knew how to move, everything
Always wanting more, he'd leave you longing for

Black velvet in that little boy's smile
Black velvet in that slow, southern style
A new religion that'll bring you to your knees
Black velvet if you please

Up in Memphis, the music's like a heat wave
White lightning, bound to drive you wild
Mama's baby's in the heart of every schoolgirl
"Love Me Tender" leaves 'em cryin' in the aisle

The way he moved, it was a sin, so sweet and true
Always wanting more, he'd leave you longing for
You might also like
Black velvet in that little boy's smile
Black velvet in that slow, southern style
A new religion that'll bring you to your knees
Black velvet if you please

Every word of every song that he sang was for you
In a flash he was gone, it happened so soon
What could you do?


Black velvet in that little boy's smile
Black velvet in that slow, southern style
A new religion that'll bring you to your knees
Black velvet if you please

Black velvet in that little boy's smile
Black velvet in that slow, southern style
A new religion that'll bring you to your knees
Black velvet if you please

If you please
If you please (If you please)
If you please (If you please)Embed
