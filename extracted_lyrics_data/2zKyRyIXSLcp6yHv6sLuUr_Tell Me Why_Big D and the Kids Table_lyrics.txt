*coughing*
Yo, it's sore throat Big Baller B
Back again with another banger, man

Bitch, I got the sauce
Bitch, you know I got the sauce
If you ain't got the sauce
Then you better get lost
Big Baller B, no games we have to toss
Talking shit on the internet
You gonna get lost
Bitch, I got the sauce

If you ain't got the sauce
Then you better get lost
Big Baller B, no games we have to toss
Talking shit on the internet
You gonna get lost

Bitch, excuse me
But uh, it seems like you
Trying to get extra sauce
Sir, you need to get lost
B got the sauce and we ain't gonna give it up
B on a yacht, he gonna live it up
B with your girl, she gonna give me what
I'mma make her wet, she gonna tell me what
Bitch I'm the sauce master
She was the boss master
Taking all your girls like a motherfucking pokemaster
Fuck on your bitch, she getting naughty
Ga, ga, ga, bitch I'm in the product
She was like "Oh damn it homie, why you big baller"
I said "my big baller dollars stacking the ceiling"
She didn't even holler
What the hell you even looking for, you dumb bitch
Bitch, I'm on sight and you ain't right about it
Bitch, I doubt every single word you saying
Bitch, I'm talking in this shit
You know my shit gone crazy
Talk dumb, dumb, dumb to me
Dumb, dumb, dumb to me
Watch out this AK spray (bum, bum, bum)

Yung Schmoobin, and I'm saucing like a ladle
And you know I got your girl bent over on the table
Your girl telling me to sauce it up
So I do, do the two, she time it up
Fill up the cup, yeah
Yeah, I got the flex, got the drip, got the sauce
If you ain't messing with me and Baller B, it's your loss
Yeah, I got the sauce dripping with pants
With the pattern like confetti
And the coat like a yeti
This one's for the folks that be dead inside
Mini golf champion, you got no drive plug (OH)
Yeah, you just another out boy
You're looking around boy
Looking for some clout boy
You ain't get it from me or the Big Baller B
From the 343
So you know I'm the G
Yo, Yung Schmoobin
You wanna hop on my mixtape?
It's gonna be pretty fire man
Yo, I got serious bars man
You should definitely do a collab with me
You should definitely hit me up man

Yo, I got the kids on my D
Wanted me to do a verse
But I say that it hurts, yeah it hurts
Yeah, I got too much sauce for these kids
And the sauce don't equate
Because they got none

Bitch, I got the sauce
Bitch, you know I got the sauce
If you ain't got the sauce

If you ain't got the sauce

Big Baller B, no games we have to toss
Talking shit on the internet
You gonna get lostEmbed
