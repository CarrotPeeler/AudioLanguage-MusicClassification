2 ContributorsAll That Talking LyricsAnd when it happens it's like
Honey and pain, horns in the rain
Misty seas and mysteries
A dog with no name, it's that time again
Not sure if I'm sleeping
But the vision's as clear as fog on the pier
Someone fishing aimlessly
A thought's an idea, a sound is an ear
And gods with none believing
Being chased by the lamb, a knife in its hand
Looked down from that mountain
Saw the moon get a tan on the beach with no sand
Something came and something ran
To make up my mind, is it bleak or it fine?
She looked a little doubtful
Smirked and said it's divine to light with no lime, sometimes
Oh it's too late I can't stop
Moving my mouth, I'll shush but I'll shout
Something's got a hold of me
Those words coming out like froth from a stout
Dreamboat's sailing into
Stormy weather I see, salty debris
Cows and tigers jumping at some
Mad dignity, but passionately we'll be
Oh finding
Ways without words to sing and to purr
Loving without declarations
Stuttered and slurred, elephants blurred
Nerves resisting urges serve
To speak with no sight, a bat taking flight
Only to find tooth marks
In that sex dynamite, my girl's got a bite, that's right
