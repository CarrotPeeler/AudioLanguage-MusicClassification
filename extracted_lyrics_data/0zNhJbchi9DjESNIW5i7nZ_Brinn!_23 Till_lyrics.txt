1 ContributorBreaking News Lyrics
Head Nodding,car dodging,lane switching
Yellow diamonds custom jewlery
12 in my rear view trying to get me
Bad bitch no panties sitting near
And i swear she something serious
Im in this skyline GT its all red like the
Gang my pops banged in 83
You can find me in the city by the sea
Where Filthy Pac said talk gwap or don't speak
But in 8th grade i was yelling pushaz ink
Smashing down rosecrans like a nigga PC
Cause i done hit a lick for about 10gz
Layne hit my phone like boy you on Tv
I said boy boy sheesh might be 23 till im back
To the streets till im back on the scene
Still searching for the lime light
Wait let me get my lines  right taking my time
Getting my mind right getting my moms right
We still hustle for the big whops AK's pull out like pit stops
8k's four days block been hot,big tymers want Cash Money instant
No window to piss out we missed routes and picked
Vices and habits that made the pigs hot
So they sizzled and came down like pin drops
Had to reject bounce back or get got
Summertime you ice cold your wrist cost
Think bout it you ice cold your wrist cost
Theyll bring heaters can't freeze em sound like a big lost
Im ten toes don't try to ball you'll get mossed
Your legs shaking your head bobbing that's
Kris Cross, you big talk i know about ya
Ya big talk i heard about ya
Ya big talk whats the word bout ya
Bring the hoe out ya
Bring the ghost out ya
We ain't friendly, quick right,screeching from the tires
Sirens still beside me.fuck! whats a nigga gotta do so im shooting from the 3
And the 12 is my hoop looked at the dash 120 in the coupe
Road block ahead ima ram right through
Brrrrrrrrrrr what happened to that boy
Brrrrrrrrrrr what got to that boy
From the screen like damn they gon shoot that boy
To live and die in LA
Bullets shatter through the paint
Mami dead where she lay
Amen say my grace
Let my life fade away
Let my life fade away
To live and die in LAYou might also likeEmbed
