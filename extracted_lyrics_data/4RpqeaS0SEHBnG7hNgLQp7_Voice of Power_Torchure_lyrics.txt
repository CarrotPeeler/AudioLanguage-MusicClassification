My last hope it's last life
Take your chance - now
Don't leave me alone in the dark
Let me do something on the outside
So you'll get much more
Than you ever expected before
Believe me - Follow my directions
Feel me - In your body and -
You will find
Can you find something alone?
Tell me what do you find
You can't find it alone
Follow me - I show you all - Forget yourself
I said forget it - Put your trust in me
(solo Malte)
I'm the fire - The best for you
I'm only power - For me just death
I'm sure - When you have doubts
Take more and more - And let me out
I like to grow in force - I am you killer
If you don't know - what you want
Do what thou wilt - Take my energy
If you stand still
My power brings you death - like meYou might also likeEmbed
