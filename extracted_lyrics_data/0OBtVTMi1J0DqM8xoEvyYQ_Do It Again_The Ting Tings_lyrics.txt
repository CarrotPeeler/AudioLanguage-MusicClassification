Stop short, do it again now
Restart, do it again now
We love, Do It Again now
Go do something wrong
Do it again now, do it again now
Pretty sure I'd do it again now
Do it again now, do it again now

I wake up in the morning
Sick of all the same old
Someone else is playing gold
Someone else is on a roll
How about you checking out
Something that we're doing wrong
Stop short, do it again now
Restart, do it again now

But it can never happen
Everybody's rappin'
You wonder how you got here
You dream about the future
So how about you think 'bout
Something that you're doing wrong
You might also like
Stop short, do it again now
Restart, do it again now
We love Do It Again now
Now go do something wrong
(Do something wrong)
Stop short, do it again now
Restart, do it again now
We love Do It Again now
Go do something wrong
Someone's talking down

I got a bunch of roses
Didn't know how to hold it
I couldn't afford my soul it
It's lying here in the garden, oh
I think I'm doing something wrong

I wake up in the morning
Sick of all the same old
Someone else is playing gold
Someone else is on a roll
How about you checking out
Something that we're doing wrong
Oh baby, something wrong
Please do something wrong
Oh baby, something wrong
Please do something wrongEmbed
