6 ContributorsAlone Again Or LyricsYeah
I said it's alright
I won't forget
All the times I've waited patiently for you
And you'll do just what you choose to do
And I will be alone again tonight, my dear
Yeah
I heard a funny thing
Somebody said to me
"You know that I could be in love with almost everyone
And I think that people are the greatest fun"
And I will be alone again tonight, my dear
And I will be alone again tonight, my dear
(Whooooop!)
Yeah
I heard a funny thing
Somebody said to me
"You know that I could be in love with almost everyone;
I think that people are the greatest fun"
And I will be alone again tonight, my dear
And I will be alone again tonight, my dearSee Calexico LiveGet tickets as low as $81You might also likeEmbed
