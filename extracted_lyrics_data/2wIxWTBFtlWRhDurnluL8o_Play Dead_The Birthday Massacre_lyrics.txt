And boys are so cold; they speak without meaning
The only time they talk is in their sleep
And girls are a bore; their touch without feeling
Their secrets always far too grim to keep
And up until now, you've lived in their shadows
Trying hard to please them
But they'll never change as long as they're breathing

Thinking hurts and thoughts don't rhyme
To those of us who've never tried
To find a face behind our lipstick smiles
And as our pretty faces die
Our broken hearts will wonder why
The makeup just won't hide the scars of time

And boys are so cruel; so don't let them find you tonight
And girls are so vain; so put them behind you tonight
I'll cast you a spell, a magic where everyone plays dead forever
And after tonight they'll never remind you

Thinking hurts and thoughts don't rhyme
To those of us who've never tried
To find a face behind our lipstick smiles
And as our pretty faces die
Our broken hearts will wonder why
The makeup just won't hide the scars of timeSee The Birthday Massacre LiveGet tickets as low as $67You might also likeEmbed
