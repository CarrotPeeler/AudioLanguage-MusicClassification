I've been alone with you inside my mind
And in my dreams, I've kissed your lips a thousand times
I sometimes see you pass outside my door

Hello
Is it me you're looking for?
I can see it in your eyes
I can see it in your smile
You're all I've ever wanted
And these arms are open wide
'Cause you know just what to say
You know just what to do
I want to tell you so much
I love you

I long to see the sunlight in your hair
And tell you time and time again how much I care
Sometimes I feel my heart will overflow

Hello
I've just got to let you know
'Cause I wonder where you are
And I wonder what you do
Are you somewhere feeling lonely?
Or is someone loving you?
Tell me how to win your heart
For I haven't got a clue
Let me start by saying
That I love you

I wonder where you are
And I wonder what you do
Are you somewhere feeling lonely?
Is someone loving you?
Tell me how to win your heart
'Cause I haven't got one clue
But let me start by saying
I love you
I love youEmbed
