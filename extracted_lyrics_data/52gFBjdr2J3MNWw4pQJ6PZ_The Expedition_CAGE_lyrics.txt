1 ContributorExpedition Lyrics
Look at all the fishes swimming in the sea
Take it in, and then just breathe
We're going on an expedition today
You'll be seeing lots of creatures on the way

The expedition is about to begin
You'll want to see all the exhibits
The expedition is about to begin
Trust me, you won't want to miss it


Over here, the monkey's in a cage
He's eating a banana and looking unfazed
Over there, there's a lion roaring loud
You don't want to disturb him, so don't make a sound

The expedition is about to begin
You'll want to see all the exhibits
The expedition is about to begin
Trust me, you won't want to miss it
You might also like
Did you hear a brown bear growling just now?
Brown bears are the most widespread bears around
Do you see a panda munching on some bamboo?
That's 99 percent of a panda's diet, yes, that's true

The expedition is about to begin
You'll want to see all the exhibits
The expedition is about to begin
Trust me, you won't want to miss it

There are some starfish swimming here, look and see
Starfish are invertebrates that live in the sea
In this tank there are some lobsters, isn't that nice?
A girl I have a crush on tells me lobsters mate for life

The expedition is about to begin
You'll want to see all the exhibits
The expedition is about to begin
Trust me, you won't want to miss itEmbed
