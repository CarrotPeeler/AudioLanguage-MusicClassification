3 ContributorsThe Light Will Stay On Lyrics
I go to sleep, before the devil wakes
And I wake up, before the angels take
All my worldly desires, All my yardsticks of fear
Hangin' down, hangin' down
I go to sleep, before the devil wakes
And I wake up, before the angels take
All my secrets untold, all my motives unclear
Hangin' down in the fire, burnin' them higher
Won't take them away from here

And long, after we're gone
The lights will stay on
The lights will stay on

Watched the city, city of crows
Watched them fly, watched 'em all flyin' low
Out above the flood plain, just above the dirt road
They were hungry as winter, hungry as us
Not afraid to be flyin', not afraid to be lost

And long, after we're gone
The lights will stay on
The lights will stay on
You might also like
And if you bury me, add three feet to it
One for your sorrow, two for your sweat
Three for the strange things we never forget

And long, after we're gone
The lights will stay on
The lights will stay on
And long, after we're safe
The lights will not fade
The lights will not fadeEmbed
