Searchin', I'm always searchin'
Searchin' for my beloved
I'm gonna keep on searchin' 'cause I need your love, yeah
Listen, my heart is calling
Longing to have you near me
Please believe me, what I'm saying is true

Every morning I wake up to you
(Searchin', searchin', searchin', searchin')
Every afternoon you help me through
(Searchin', searchin', searchin', searchin')
Every night my thoughts return to calling you

Lover, don't keep me waiting
You must hear what I'm saying
I'm gonna keep on searchin' 'til I win your love, yeah

I can almost hear her gentle voice
(Searchin', searchin', searchin', searchin')
I can almost hear her smile of light
(Searchin', searchin', searchin', searchin')
I can almost feel the love reach out to meYou might also likeEmbed
