4 ContributorsSomeday, Someway LyricsWell, it's important that you understand me
Appreciate my point of view
Some date and time I'm gonna make you mine
I ain't never givin' up on you
So don't keep tellin' me
You're just not ready to give your love away
Someday someway
Somebody's gonna love you
Someday someway
What will be will be
Someday someway
Now, you open your eyes
And you'll see, baby, it's me
Well I heard a like a rollin' thunder
And I felt like a motherless son
Steady and strong I still hold on
Waiting for my chance to come
Someday someway
Somebody's gonna love you
Someday someway
What will be will be
Someday someway
Now, you open your eyes
And you'll see, baby, it's me
