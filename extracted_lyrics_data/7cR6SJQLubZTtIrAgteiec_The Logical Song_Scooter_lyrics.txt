20 ContributorsThe Logical Song Lyrics
When I was young
It seemed that life was so wonderful
A miracle, oh, it was beautiful, magical
And all the birds in the trees
Well, they'd be singing so happily
So joyfully, oh, playfully, watching me

Good morning!
Yeaaaaaah!
One, two... one, two, three, four!
Pump it up!
Aaaah!

I ramp, me no ramp, me no skin
Me no play, yeah
When me chant 'pon the microphone
And me say with the DJ
Junglists in the place
Junglists on the case
Scooter, are you Ratty?

When I was young
It seemed that life was so wonderful
A miracle, oh, it was beautiful, magical
And all the birds in the trees
Well, they'd be singing so happily
So joyfully, oh, playfully, watching me (Yeah!)
When I was young
It seemed that life was so wonderful
A miracle, oh, it was beautiful, magical
And all the birds in the trees
Well, they'd be singing so happily
So joyfully, oh, playfully, watching me (Come on!)
