Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls
We are proud to present the Water Element Song
We hope you like it (You like it)
W-A-T-E-R, yeah water, yeah water
Everybody loves Chill, she stays cool
Call the narwhal to pave through
Frigid Chompies up on the rocks
Glacial bashin' them Snow Clopse
With a Great Wall and brr blades
Bringin' that frozen fury
It's a cold front, no plans to stop
She shatterin' with her triple javelin shot

'Cause there's a charm, Slam Bam knows that
Summon an ice prison, the enemies know that
In a work of Ice art, act like a coffin
Brawlin' with the combo attack
Four arms, so dangerous
Cooling Factor leaves 'em in the dust
He can really move in his ice shoes
But its lights out with the ice mace
Bye, bye, have an ice day
You might also like
Let's ride the lighting
Slidin' with Zap, he's electrifying
Slime in the path and he's striking twice
His mega volts bounce and he's ridin' waves that come splashin' down
He got love for the sea, regenerating in W-A-T-E-R
We gonna charge with punishment
Bag o' Booms better move when it's thunderin'

They're powerful and they're strong
Heavy weights if you were to measure
Enemies, you better hold on
'Cause you'll buckle under their pressure
Listen up Kaos, Chompies, and everything in between
Hey, water fans, where you at?
Let them hear you scream
Water, water, water (Hey)
Water, water, water (Hey)
W-A-T-E-R (Water, what do you know about water, water, water?)
W-A-T-E-R (Water, what do you know about water, water, water?)

Hey, where'd the beet go?
(Water, what do you know about water?)
Water's in the house, and we ain't afraid to shout it
Kaos goin' down and there ain't no doubt about it
There's Gill Grunt, Slam Bam, and Zap, oh snap
And there's Chill, Wham Shell, and don't forget Thumpback (Yee)
Anchors away, watch out below ('low)
Ain't nobody messin' with the H2O-O-O-O-O-O
When Poseidon strikes, it's time to brace
Wham Shell, he's up in the place
Trident mace to his triplicates
He got that Gigantic Starfishicfus
And with his Soul Gem armor, it makes it harder
To damage the carapace plating, all the
Ice ogres they love to hate
Nightmare huggers that cover their face

But if you want them to go boom
You're gonna need the gun
Gill Grunt, then they call Neptune
With a barbed harpoon and a power hose
Jetpack flyin' watch out below
Like, oh no, oh no
We repeatin' with them harpoons
Piercin' triple shots go so easy right through the enemies like it's
Water, W-A-T-E-R, what's that spell? It's water, water
Uh, But we ain't done yet
Anchors a-yay, let's play with Thumpback
Seashell armor, you can't touch that
He's belly-floppin' and chompin'
On any cyclops that wants it, with the option to
Make a whirlpool, to get lost in
Then spray a starfish, anchor assaultin'
He's an ultimate giant, spits bad sushi that used to be Leviathan
Ha ha ha ha, nah, nah, you don't want none of
The Water Skylanders 'cause, oh no, here they come (Come)

Water's in the house, and we ain't afraid to shout it
Kaos goin' down and there ain't no doubt about it
There's Gill Grunt, Slam Bam, and Zap, oh snap
And there's Chill, Wham Shell, and don't forget Thumpback (Yee)
Anchors away, watch out below ('low)
Ain't nobody messin' with the H2O-O-O-O-O-O

W-A-T-E-R, yeah water, yeah water (Ain't nobody messin' with the)
W-A-T-E-R, yeah water, yeah water
Now, LightCore Chase is gonna sing his version
For all the little babies out there that can't say "water"
Sing along, come on
Wa-wa, wa-wa, wa-wa (Hey)
Wa-wa, wa-wa, wa-wa (Hey)
W-A-W-A, yeah, wawa, yeah, wawa (Hey)
W-A-W-A, yeah, wawa, yeah, wawa

(Water, what do you know about water?)
Water's in the house, we ain't afraid to shout it
Kaos goin' down, and there ain't no doubt about it
Anchors away, watch out below
Can't nobody mess with the H2OEmbed
