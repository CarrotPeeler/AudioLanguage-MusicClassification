5 ContributorsSea of Blasphemy Lyrics
We're down the super highway all alone
A shopping bag full of broken bones
Sick and tired of hearing telephones
Now I'm stuck in futuristic drones

Cause I
Be a vandal
Snuff my candle
Lost my handle
And now I'm really on my own
(Shuttered glass, Ape noises)

Cause I
Be a vandal
Snuff my candle
Lost my handle
And now I'm really on my own

Need to get out of this town of blasphemy
Shampoo in my eyes, I cannot see
Emancipated, but not really free
And a white negro is who I wanna be
You might also like
Cause I
Be a vandal
Snuff my candle
Lost my handle
And now I'm really on my ownEmbed
