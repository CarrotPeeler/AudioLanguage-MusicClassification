Break your own silence or just just walk away
Twist this avarice around you like a ring
You can't blame what you can't feel on anything
Coma chameleon
If you ever wake up, you will see what you have done
Coma, coma chameleon
If you ever wake up, you will see what you have done
Patent leather and the weather's doin' fine
Abandoned ambulance somewhere down the line
Tried to speak your language, now I've lost my tongue
All you had to give, you gave it to no one
Coma chameleon
If you ever wake up, you will see what you have done
Coma, coma chameleon
If you ever wake up, you will see what you have done
If you ever wake up, you will see what you have done
If you ever wake up, you will see what you have done
Ahh, ooh
Ahh, oohYou might also likeEmbed
