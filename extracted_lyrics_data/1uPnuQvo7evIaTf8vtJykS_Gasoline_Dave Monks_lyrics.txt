2 ContributorsGasoline Lyrics
Save me a part of your heart if you've got enough
It's a little thing
Oh, it's a little thing
Safe and dry inside I'm a visitor
Can I stay a while
Oh, I need a place to lie

Because gasoline is burning up
And I've been losing sleep
I just need someone to rely on
Lovers fall and break their hearts
But I need one to keep
Yah-ah-ah-ah-ah

Once i was told there was gold if you chase it down
I went runnin' on
Oh, to a different town
But taken the road on my own wasn't meant to be
Can we walk along
Oh, on a lonely street

Because gasoline is burning up
And I've been losing sleep
I just need someone to rely on
Modern love is on the rise
And I got in too deep
I just need someone to rely on
You might also likeYeah, I need someone to rely on

'Cause with the best of you
And with the best of me
We could start a fire
Without gasoline
Without gasoline

Like ships in the night we can hide from the other one
But I'm lookin' out
Oh, I am lookin' out
Throw me a line if you find that you need someone
And you can stay a while
Oh, we need a place to lie

Because gasoline is burning up
And I've been losing sleep
I just need someone to rely on
Lovers fall and break their hearts
But I need one to keep
Yah-ah-ah-ah-ah

And gasoline is burning up
And gasoline is burning up
And gasoline is burning up
Yeah, I need someone to rely on
I just need someone to rely on
Save me a part of your heart if you got enough1Embed
