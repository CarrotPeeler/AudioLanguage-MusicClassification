1 ContributorBack Home in Derry Lyrics
In 1803 we sailed out to sea
Out from the sweet cove of Derry
For Australia bound if we didn't all drown
And the marks of our fetters we'd carry
In the rusty iron chains we'd sighed for our wains
As our good wives we left in sorrow
As the mainsails unfurled our curses we'd hurled
At the English and thoughts of tomorrow

Oh-oh, I wish I was back home in Derry
Oh-oh, I wish I was back home in Derry

I cursed them to hell as our bow fought the swell
Our ship danced like a moth in the firelight
White horses rode high as the devil passed by
Takin' souls to Hades by twilight
Twelve weeks out to sea we were now forty-three
Our comrades we'd buried each mornin'
In our own slime we were lost for a time
Endless nights without dawning
You might also like
Oh-oh, I wish I was back home in Derry
Oh-oh, I wish I was back home in Derry

Van Diemen's land is a hell for a man
To live out his life in slavery
Where the climate is raw and the gun makes the law
Neither wind nor rain cares for bravery
Twenty years have gone by and I've ended me bond
My comrades' ghosts are behind me
But a rebel I came and I'll die just the same
On the cold winds of night you will find me

Oh-oh, I wish I was back home in Derry
Oh-oh, I wish I was back home in Derry
Oh-oh, I wish I was back home in Derry
Oh-oh, I wish I was back home in DerryEmbed
