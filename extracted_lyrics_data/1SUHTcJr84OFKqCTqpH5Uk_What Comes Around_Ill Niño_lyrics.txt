11 ContributorsWhat Comes Around Lyrics
I hate you, I hate you
Shut up, shut up

You think that I'm the one to blame
Everything I lose is just a piece of what there is to gain
You think it's cool and all is fine
Now is the day when you pay, this is my time
I feel for you nothing but pain
I am what you will be, you are dying in me
I love you, I hate you, I miss you

You're always thinking you're so perfect
Those thoughts drove me away from home
But if you put me through your tests
Then I will fade

I have nothing to say
But I feel like my mouth is open
Everything that is real
Comes around
Comes around
You might also like
Comes around (Shut up)
Comes around (Shut up)
Comes around (Shut up)
Comes around (Shut up)

Your stupid face just makes me sick
I see you changing every day to fit into the newest clique
I know you, but everything you do is just a part of you
You'll never see the truth
I hate the way you make me feel
I hate the way you think you're real
Your one voice, it destroys my one choice

You're always thinking you're so perfect
Those thoughts drove me away from home
But if you put me through these tests
Then I will fade

I have nothing to say
But I feel like my mouth is open
Everything that is real
Comes around
Comes around
I have nothing to say
But I feel like my mouth is open
Everything that is real
Comes around
Comes around
Comes around
Tu vida es mía
Your fear is living here in me
Es que no entiendo cómo en la vida puedes hacer
La paz entre nosotros cómo no vas a decir
Y la gratitud que tú nunca lo vas a ver
Has now turned to hate

I have nothing to say
But I feel like my mouth is wide open
Everything that is real
Comes around
Comes around
I have nothing to say
But I feel like my mouth is wide open
Everything that is real
Comes around
Comes around
Comes around

Shut up!Embed
