8 ContributorsBody Talk LyricsMorning, afternoon and night
We lay together side by side
Searchin' for lust, searchin' for breath
Searchin' for the touch of life
No words are spoken, the only sound we hear is
Body talk, body talk
The heat of passion is such a beautiful thing
As it overflows, pleasure grows
All the dreams it can bring
Your lips in my eyes and gentle sighs
If body talk, body talk
Cool and kind, so soft and pure, a touching moment
Heated feelings once exploded, but have melted
We were two souls torn apart with bitter ages
Through expression, not aggression, we have become one
Body talk, body talk
Cool and kind, so soft and pure, a touching moment
Heated feelings once explode but have melted
Ooh, we are two souls torn apart with bitter ages
Through expression, not aggression, we have become one

Searchin' for the touch of life
No words are spoken, the only sound we hear
Is body talk, body talk
Body talk
Body talk
Body talk
