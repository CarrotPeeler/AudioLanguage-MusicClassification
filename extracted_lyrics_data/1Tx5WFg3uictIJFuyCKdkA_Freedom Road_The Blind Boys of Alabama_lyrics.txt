1 ContributorFreedom Road LyricsTell me which road are you traveling
Which road are you traveling on
Tell me who you will turn to
When the light has gone
I hear somebody calling
I hear somebody calling to me
With so many roads to travel
There's just one can set you free
There's just one road
One road to freedom
There's just one road
One road to freedom
Just one
In my life I have been blessed
In my life I have been cursed
I have lived the best of times
I have suffered the worst
Do you know which road you're traveling
Do you know where you want to be
With so many roads to travel
There's just one can set you free
There's just one road
One road to freedom
There's just one road
One road to freedom
There's just one road
One road to freedom
Just oneYou might also likeEmbed
