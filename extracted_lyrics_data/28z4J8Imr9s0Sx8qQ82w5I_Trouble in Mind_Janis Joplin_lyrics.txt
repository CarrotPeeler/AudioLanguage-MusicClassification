Trouble in mind, Lord, I'm blue
I know I won't be blue always
Sun gonna shine in my lawn, shine in my back door someday

I'm gonna lay, lay my head
On that lonesome railroad line
And let the 2:19 train ease my troubled mind

Trouble in mind, Lord, I'm blue
Know I won't be blue always
And then sun's gonna shine in my lawn, shine in my back door someday

I'm going down, going down to the river
I'm gonna bring along my rocking chair
And if these blues don't leave, Lord, I'll have to rock away from here

Trouble in mind, trouble in mind, I'm blue
Know I won't be blue always
And then sun's gonna shine in my lawn, shine in my back door somеday

I'm all alone, I'm alone at midnight
And the lamp is burning low
I'vе never had so much trouble, not in my whole life, ever before
You might also like
Trouble in mind, Lord, I'm blue
Know I won't be blue always
Yeah, then wind's gonna come, it's gonna blow all my blues awayEmbed
