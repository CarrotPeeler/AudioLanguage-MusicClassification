1 ContributorWerewolf Corpse LyricsCorpse, lying down in the mud
Werewolf, killed in a nocturnal raid
During the night howls emit
From a secret dark wolf's lair
No one can see who wears the wolf skin
Dormant at day, walk among the sheep
Calls send out at night to awake the beast
Shape shift takes place, for the blood feast
Werewolf corpse, werewolf corpse
Lusting for blood, bringer of death
I've come to shred your flesh
Werewolf corpse, werewolf corpse
Lusting for blood, bringer of death
I've come to shred your flesh
Corpse lying down in the mud
Werewolf killed in a nocturnal raid
During the night howls emit
Calling for the sacred lust
Werewolf corpse, werewolf corpse
You might also likeLusting for blood, bringer of death
I've come to shred your flesh
Werewolf corpse, werewolf corpse
Secret order raised in the darkest hour
Victims are selected for the wolves to devour
Recalling the myths of ancient times
In order to keep a sacred bloodline
Werewolf corpse, werewolf corpse
Werewolf corpse, werewolf corpseEmbed
