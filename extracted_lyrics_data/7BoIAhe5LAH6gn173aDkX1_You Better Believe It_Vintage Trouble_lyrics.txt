3 ContributorsYou Better Believe It Lyrics
Oooh
Well

Last train leaving the station
And I'm gonna take it
Before I'm broken more by this situation
I am gonna break it

Lord Knows I've tried more than any man could
And I did more than I swore I ever would
Now I'm turning the good into gone
And I'm shuffling on my way

You better believe it
(You better believe it)
You better believe it
(You better believe it)
A ray of light
Found its way to my mind
Knots untie
You better believe it
You might also like
Last tug boat to part the water
And I'm diving for it
(Diving and diving and diving)
A little sparrow inside saying, "Fly, Baby"
How can I ignore it
(Fly, Baby, Fly, Baby, Fly)

Child, I have walked on the glass that you broke
While I stayed and I prayed on my knees in hope
I swallowed my breath and I choked
Holding on to the rope
I gotta let go

You better believe it
(You better believe it)
You better believe it
(You better believe it)
A ray of light
Found its way to my mind
Knots untie
You better believe it
Yeah

Gone, gone, gone

You better, better believe it
(You better believe it)
You better believe it
(You better believe it)
A ray of light
Found its way to my mind
Knots untie
You heard me right
You better believe it
(You better believe it)
You better believe it
(You better believe it)
A ray of light
Found its way to my mind
Knots untie
You better believe it

I said, a ray of light
Found its way to my mind
Knots untie
You better believe it
You better believe it
You better believe it
You better believe
