3 ContributorsSatisfied LyricsEverybody wants a magic carpet ride
All I wanna be is satisfied
It's deep and muddy, family crying
All I wanna be is satisfied
Just gimme a place to hang my hat
Someone who loves me
I don't need much more than that
(Wanna be satisfied)
I wanna be just satisfied
(Satisfied)
Don't you forget I'm home and tired
All we wanna be is satisfied
Rock 'n roll won't fill the night
All we wanna be is satisfied
Give us a place to hang our hat
Someone to hold, someone to talk to
That's all right (Satisfy)
Satisfy me (Satisfy)
(I don't wanna be) set up for life
(I don't wanna have) a nameless wife
(I don't wanna be) an inside tip
(I don't wanna be) a billion kick

All I wanna be is satisfied
You can go on forever, never decide
If anything you do is justified
Everybody (Ooh, ooh)
Deep down (Ooh, ooh)
I talk back (Ooh, ooh)
Very deep
Gimme a place to hang my hat
Someone to hold, someone to talk to
I just wanna be (Satisfied)
Satisfied (Satisfied)
(I don't wanna be) a politician
(I don't wanna be) in bad position
(I don't wanna be) an inside tip
(I don't wanna be) a billion kick
I just wanna be
I just wanna be
I just wanna be satisfied (Satisfied)
That's what I want (Satisfied)
I wanna be forever (Satisfied)
I wanna be anytime (Satisfied)
Oh yeah
I wanna be forever (Satisfied)
I wanna be anytime (Satisfied)Embed
