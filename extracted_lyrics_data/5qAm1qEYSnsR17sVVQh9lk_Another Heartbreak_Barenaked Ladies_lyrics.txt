Hold on, here comes another heartbreak
Hold on, here comes another heartache
Too bad, but it's still a chance I had to take
Hold on, here comes another heartbreak

Soaking in another rainy day
I stopped to watch the long parade
That's winding slowly
Through the maze

Hold on, here comes another heartbreak
Hold on, here comes another heartache
Too bad, but it's still a chance I had to take
Hold on, here comes another heartbreak

I lost my way in the summer breeze
I fell down to my hands and knees
And now I am searching
Through the autumn leaves

Hold on, here comes another heartbreak
Hold on, here comes another heartache
Too bad, but it's still a chance I had to take
Hold on, here comes another heartbreak
You might also like
Now here you stand in front of me
In all of the complexity
That I had mistaken
For simplicity

Hold on, here comes another heartbreak
Hold on, here comes another heartache
Too bad, but it's still a chance I had to take
Hold on, here comes another heartbreak
Hold onEmbed
