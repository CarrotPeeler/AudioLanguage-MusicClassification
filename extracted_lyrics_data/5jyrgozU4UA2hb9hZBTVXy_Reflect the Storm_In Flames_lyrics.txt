7 ContributorsReflect the Storm Lyrics
Shot for shot
Let the bullets penetrate me
Embrace me
Tell me stories of golden gods
The precision in your voice
Pierce the walls that I've built
Your eyes reach deep in me

Take a chance

They don't come much bigger than this
One dark star
Spend another day with me
A dead surface that doesn't reflect
The storm underneath
Take the chance
Bring me the calm

And it leaves nothing
Expose the dark side
Aching and emotional
Expose the dark side
Impossible to tame
You might also like
Away from the light of the sun
Away I find what is really me

Throw yourself into the eye of chaos
Infiltrate me
Sneak out before I awake
Take out the trash and burn it
Try to find a beautiful place to lay
These fragile bones of mine

Away from the light of the sun
Away I find what is really me
Away from the light of the sun
Away I find what is really me


And it leaves nothing
Expose the dark side
Aching and emotional
Expose the dark side
Impossible to tame
Away from the light of the sun
Away I find what is really me
Away from the light of the sun
Away I find what is really me
Away from the light of the sun
Away I find what is really meEmbed
