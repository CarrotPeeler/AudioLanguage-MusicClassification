3 ContributorsEzra Pound â€“ Axe King Lyrics
Now Ezra Pound was a fine young man
Though possibly a bit of a dandy
But when it came to writing things down
You know, you know, you know he was pretty handy
But remember this, you pretentious shits
With all your books up on the shelf

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
When he came, his dick went limp like everybody else
Like everybody else, like everybody else, like everybody else
Like everybody else

Ron Hitler-Barassi: "Any comments, Jeremy?"
