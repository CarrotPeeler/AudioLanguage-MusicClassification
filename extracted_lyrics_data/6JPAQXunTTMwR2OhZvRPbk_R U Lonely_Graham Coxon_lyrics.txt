4 ContributorsR U Lonely? LyricsWhen all the nights are dream and not really what they seem
I'd cut my hair in spite and set my hands on fire
Are you lonely? Are you lonely? Are you lonely?
In the daylight hours I go out and kill the flowers
Faces all too clear, keep on looming near
Are you lonely? Are you lonely? Are you lonely?You might also likeEmbed
