5 ContributorsFlying High Lyrics
You can't know, oh no, you can't know
How much I think about you, no
It's making my head spin
Looking at you and you are looking at me
And we both know what we want, mmm
So close to giving in

Feel so nice, oh yeah, you feel so nice
Wish I could spend the night
But I can't pay the price
Oh no, no

But I'm flying so high
High off the ground
When you're around
And I can feel you're high
Rocking me inside
It's too much to hide

I know, oh yes, I know
That we can't be together
But I just like to dream
It's so strange the way our paths have crossed
How we were brought together, mmm
It's written in the stars it seems
You might also like
Feel so nice, oh yeah you feel so nice
I'd love to spend the night
But I can't pay the price
Oh no, no

And I'm flying so high
High off the ground
When you're around
And I can feel you're high
Touching me inside
And it's too much to hide

Back to earth, where did you take me to?
I know there's no such thing
This painless love, well it'll catch us up
And we can never win
But oh, I feel so alive
Oh, just wanna hold you
Hold you so tight

And I'm flying so high
High off the ground
When you're around
And I can feel your high
Touching me inside
And it's too much to hide
And I'm flying so high
High off the ground
When you're aroundEmbed
