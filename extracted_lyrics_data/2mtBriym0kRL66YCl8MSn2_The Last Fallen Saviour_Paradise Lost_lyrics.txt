4 ContributorsThe Last Fallen Saviour LyricsPerceived as something you cannot wish
A dream that someday you can exist
Fortune in tears forever taken in vain
For the last fallen saviour
For the ones that betrayed us
The grief is something you can't restrict
Belief that someday you can resist
Fortune in tears forever taken in vain
Scream but your voice is unheard as you descend
Forever taking the pain
Forever's taken awaySee Paradise Lost LiveGet tickets as low as $77You might also likeEmbed
