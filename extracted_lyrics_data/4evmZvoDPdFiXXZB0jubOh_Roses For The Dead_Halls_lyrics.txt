2 ContributorsRoses For The Dead LyricsServe our backs, suffer long this time
Rose are flowers shadowing the light
We were bells start... round the bell
Our body soothe in the bitter light

And it starts to creep on me and I would... up
There are the... of these faces
And they don't cheer me...You might also likeEmbed
