1 ContributorMay This Flame Flicker Out LyricsIn a small lamp of oil
This flame was brought
Hatefully
Into being
In hubris snatched
From nothing
And tossed into suffering
From the torrents of black
Was it plucked
The flint
Violently struck
And in misfortune
The spark took
The doors of the cage
Firmly locked
There is naught to do
But tend it
Build it into a firebrand of rebellion
Tossed into the oil well of creation
To bring all into a rapturous consumption
Burn the world into bright dissolution
To burn this
Fucker down
You might also likeAnd as fires burn high
To turn
All to soot
On the breeze
Return it to black
Comforting silence
All alive
Will breathe a
Thankful last sigh
And as the fires grow cold
And the embеrs
Fail to glow
May great dark sleep enfold
And nothingness еngulf
And may this flame
May this flame
May this flame flicker out
Be erased from all consciousness
Without a doubt
From the torrents of black
Was it plucked
The flint
Violently struck
And in misfortune
The spark took
The doors of the cage
Firmly locked
There is naught to do
But tend it
Build it into a firebrand of rebellion
Tossed into the oil well of creation
To bring all into a rapturous consumption
Burn the world into bright dissolution
To burn this
Fucker down
And as fires burn high
To turn
All to soot
On the breeze
Return it to black
Comforting silence
All alive
Will breathe a
Thankful last sigh
And as the fires grow cold
And the embers
Fail to glow
May great dark sleep enfold
And nothingness engulf
And may this flame
May this flame
May this flame flicker out
Be erased from all consciousness
Without a doubt
There is nought to do but tend it
Build it into a firebrand of rebellion
May this flame
May this flame
May this flame flicker out
Bring all into that rapturous consumption
Burn all the world into bright dissolution
May this flame
May this flame
May this flame flicker out
Oh
The greatest part
Of us all
Is that part
That must be dissolved
May this flame
May this flame
May this flame flicker out
Oh
I'll release this spark
From the torturous wheel
I will snuff this flame
In the waters of Ginn
I’ll release this spark
From the torturous wheel
I will snuff this flame
In the waters of potentiality
Potentiality
There is nought to do but tend it
Build it into a firebrand of rebellion
May this flame
May this flame
May this flame flicker out
Bring all into that rapturous consumption
Burn all the world into bright dissolution
May this flame
May this flame
May this flame flicker outEmbed
