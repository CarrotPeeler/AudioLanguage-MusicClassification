1 ContributorHeart of Me Lyrics
You always take the heart of me
And leave it there it stays to be
What is it for?
Do you want more?
It takes a while to grasp on to
The softness of a heart I knew
What is it for?
Why did you wrong me?

In the bus, I fall all the time
My feet give up and gravity is mine
I throw myself from anything that's tall
And fall

I want to live and learn to love
And you're the one I put above
But what is it for?
Could there be more?

In the bus, I fall all the time
My feet give up and gravity is mine
I throw myself from stairs and trains, from trees and planes
As long as I can fallSee Carpark North LiveGet tickets as low as $105You might also likeEmbed
