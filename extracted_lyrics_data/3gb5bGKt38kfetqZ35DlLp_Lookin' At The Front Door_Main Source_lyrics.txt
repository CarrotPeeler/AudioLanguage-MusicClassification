5 ContributorsOmega Man Lyrics
Yeah, yeah, the land of the lost
A place where we dwell

We from a lost land where there's MC's, not pop bands
When I was cold, gettin' dumb, you 
Now you're actin' like this rap shit was meant for
Any sap that's handin' in a forged rap consent form
It's trench war, smell the death stenchin' flesh, raw
The rest of y'all ain't even fit to fuckin' benchwarm
This ain't a rent form, you can't fake a reference here
Now, pay your penance, or as tenants, you'll be yesteryear's
Hard pressed to hear any new verse that's nearin' par
Worth appearance fees are fit to charge sixteen bars
Yeah, I hear 'em sayin' hip-hop's passed
But I'ma resurrect the bitch and rip the lid off its casket
Spit sharp as marksmen, sixth comin' of Rakim
A craftsman, sergeant at arms, graspin' stardom
Spit blisterin' scripts, convicted arsonist
Murderous, purgin' the scene like Joseph Stalin
My flow's slalom, skied up, nose blown, I'm chargin'
Stage divin', Wrath of Kane live, Apollo, Harlem
Hall of Fame name draped in martyrdom
A lone figure flyin' the flag like it's Tiananmen

We from a long lost planet where rap is real
Still intact and untapped by the mass appeal
"The way that I feel can never be healed
And all we left with is a memory feel"
We from a long lost planet where rap is real
Still intact and untapped by the mass appeal
"The way that I feel can never be healed
And all we left with is a memory feel"

We from a lost land where the clock's hands are stopped
'Fore the rot set in, before they shot Scott La Rock
Before the shops stocked rap in a section called "Urban"
And every third person's thinkin' they're word surgeons
But y'all virgins, first come, first served and
Squirt ya nut with the first pump and call curtains
I got this bitch skirt hitched up, mid tit-fuck
But it ain't feel the same since the game got that nip-tuck
Now it's all plastic, lackin' core fabric
And I'm lookin' at the front door like Main Source's classic
Shit, I ain't about to go and bounce from a sinkin' ship
But things are grim reapin' on the brink of extinction
With original blueprints, guidelines and standards
Am I the only one who took them Time's Up rhymes for granted?
"Of course we gotta pay rent, so money connects"
But I'd still rather be broke and have a whole lotta respect
It's the principle of it, I get a rush like I'm dusted
Crushin' these motherfuckers is what I've become accustomed to
My flow's effortless, no rest, I pepper this
Mic like my life dependin', walkin', glowin' reference

"The way that I feel can never be healed
And all we left with is a memory feel"
We from a long lost planet where rap is real
Still intact and untapped by the mass appeal
"The way that I feel can never be healed
Yo, this game is a memory feel"

"On the real, we need to bring back to where it really oughta be"1Embed
