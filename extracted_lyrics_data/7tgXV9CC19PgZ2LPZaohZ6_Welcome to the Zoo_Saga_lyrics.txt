1 ContributorWelcome To The Zoo LyricsAnnie's got a thing about leather
Bobby's got a thing about lace
Maryanne's getting light as a feather
Just like the nose that used to be on her face
Somebody tell me
What the hell is goin' on
Oh Please
Cause I've bin standing here
For way too long
Welcome to our Zoo
Welcome to the Zoo
We saved a room for you
Sally's got a ring in her naval
Larry's got a spoon up his nose
Peggy Sue likes to eat when she's able
Just how she's able to, God only knowsYou might also likeEmbed
