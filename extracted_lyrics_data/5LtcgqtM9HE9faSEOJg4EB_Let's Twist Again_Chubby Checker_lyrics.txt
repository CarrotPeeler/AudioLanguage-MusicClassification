Come on, everybody
Clap your hands
Aw, you're lookin' good
I'm gonna sing my song
It won't take long
We're gonna do the Twist
And it goes like this

Come on, let's Twist again like we did last summer
Yeah, let's Twist again like we did last year
Do you remember when things were really hummin'?
Yeah, let's Twist again, Twistin' time is here

Hee-ah, 'round and 'round and up and down we go again
Oh, baby, make me know you love me so and then

Twist again like we did last summer
Come on, Twist again like we did last year
Twist, yeow!

Twist again, like we did last summer
Come on, let's Twist again like we did last year
Do you remember when things were really hummin'?
Come on, let's Twist again, Twistin' time is here

Hee-ah, 'round and 'round and up and down we go again
Oh, baby, make me know you love me so and then
