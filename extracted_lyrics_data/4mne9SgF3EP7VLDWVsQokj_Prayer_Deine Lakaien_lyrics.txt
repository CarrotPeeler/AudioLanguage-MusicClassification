1 ContributorPrayer LyricsIgnored her anxious eyes
Zippered his pants
One of his routine lies
Took her hands
I MUST BE OFF
She was the only one
Short before closing
He was the drunken one
Without looking
No time for scuff
LORD YOU GAVE US MOTHER NATURE
THAT GAVE US THE RIGHT TO HATE YOU
WE FOUND OUT WHAT WE ARE MADE FROM
WE SET OUT CREATE A BETTER ONE
She was not the pretty one
Remained alone
And when her child was born
Stayed on her own
And still in love
She had to rush about
Make their living
There was no time for doubts
For misgiving
Her heart in love
You might also likeLORD YOU GAVE US MOTHER NATURE
THAT GAVE US THE RIGHT TO HATE YOU
WE FOUND OUT WHAT WE ARE MADE FROM
WE SET OUT CREATE A BETTER ONE
She had to make a stop
Put down her bag
This day was far too hot
Must have a break
Just a silent moaning
Blow at her fabula
Snatch at the handle
Thanks to you grandma
Off he was
Just a silent groaning
LORD YOU GAVE US MOTHER NATURE
THAT GAVE US THE RIGHT TO HATE YOU
WE FOUND OUT WHAT WE ARE MADE FROM
WE SET OUT CREATE A BETTER ONE
Her genetic code
Storage room
Just a single note
On her form
Low grade and old
Someone found it there
Took it home
Had a bright idea
One billion clones
With a heart of gold
LORD YOU GAVE US MOTHER NATURE
THAT GAVE US THE RIGHT TO HATE YOU
WE FOUND OUT WHAT WE ARE MADE FROM
WE SET OUT CREATE A BETTER ONEEmbed
