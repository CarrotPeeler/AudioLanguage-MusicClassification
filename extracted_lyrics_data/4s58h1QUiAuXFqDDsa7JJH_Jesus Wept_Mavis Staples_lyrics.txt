3 ContributorsJesus Wept Lyrics
My throat quits when I try to say
How I long for the day
How I wish there was a way
I could see you again

I wither next to my thorns
I thread my tongue through the horn
Arm in arm we are born
Arm in arm to the end

Side streets I have worn
Through late summer storms
I should have told you
I could live without you
But I don't want to

My heart lifts when I sing
The joy I could bring
It doesn't mean a thing
I want to see you again

I wither next to my thorns
I thread my tongue through the horn
Arm in arm in arm we are born
Arm in arm to the end

My throat quits when I try to say
How I long for the day
How I wish there was a way
To see you again

Side streets I have worn
Through late summer storms
I should have told you
I could live without you
But I don't want to
But I don't want to
I don't want toEmbed
