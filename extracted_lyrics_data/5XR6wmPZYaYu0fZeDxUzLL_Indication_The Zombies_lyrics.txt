3 ContributorsIndication Lyrics
It's not that you're wrong
It's just that I am right
I don't want to be tied down every day and every night

Now I've got an indication
I'll hold out against sensation
I know that if I really try
I think I can hold out

If you think
You've got me under wrong
You may be right, but I won't be the one to settle down

Now I've got an indication
I'll hold out against sensation
I know that if I really try
I think I can hold out

But if I can't hold out, keep away from you
I can see it happening, I will be with you
You might also like
If it happens
There's nothin' I can do
But realize that you have won and it's no use to fight

Now I've got an indication
I'll hold out against sensation
I know that if I really try
I think I can hold out
Now I've got an indication
I'll hold out against sensation
I know that if I really try
I think I can hold outEmbed
