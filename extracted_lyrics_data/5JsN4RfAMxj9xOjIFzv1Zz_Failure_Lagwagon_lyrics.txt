4 ContributorsFailure LyricsPick up please
The boys give you validity
They give you what you want
They can never give enough
Only charity until you're sorry
Victimized
One thing I can't criticize
Given you struggle
Could you ever be alone?
Seems impossible and still i'm sorry
Saint freedom
It's so easy when you give up
No matter what i've done
I could never be the one
It's never effortless to fail
I can rely on this
Could you ever rely on me
Jealousy
The boys give you validity
No matter what you've done
I could never be the one
Just a shareholder of lies
I put you to bed
They will always leave
Independent of you
You could never deny
I always knew how to fail you
I always knew youYou might also likeEmbed
