2 ContributorsLust for Life Lyrics
Comin' out of misery
Back to the old energy
Takin' part in our daily show
Think of what has been before
Made a move and slammed the door
Future will remain in the unknown

Face the face of the race, try to understand
Why are we here and what do we want
The answer is easy, let's spread it around

Loud and proud
We're gonna say it now
Live life
(Easy)
Live life
(Easy)
Every day

Many things to think about
Bring me up or bring me down
A lot of things I hardly understand
What is good and what is fair
Problems solved, but I don't care
Sometimes, it's just getting out of hand
You might also like
Face the face of the race, try to understand
I know that you know that we can be strong
If we pull together, we can get along

Loud and proud
We're gonna say it now
Live life
(Easy)
Live life
(Easy)
Every day

Ooh, let us fly away, let us praise the days
When the lust for the life is stronger than the fear
Though we shiver and shake
And we sometimes need a break
It's the lust for life that never disappears

Loud and proud
We're gonna say it now
Live life
(Easy)
Live life
(Easy)
Live... life... easyEmbed
