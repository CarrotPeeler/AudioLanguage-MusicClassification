6 ContributorsTaking You Down Lyrics
I've had enough
I'm taking you down, taking you down
I've had enough
I'm taking you down, taking you down

You've been all up in my face
Out of line and out of place
Blurring views, distorting facts
Every time I turn my back
I'll make you know your position
Don't talk, just shut up and listen
No way out now, you can't play dumb
Get up, get up and come get some

[I've had enough
I'm taking you down, taking you down
I've had enough
I'm taking you down, taking you down]

I feel the hate that you breed
It's the fix that feeds your greed
Set your bait, set your trap
Take a seat and watch me snap
You might also likeI'll shake the ground that you stand on
I'll still be here when you're long gone
This world is mine, you can't have it
It's my turn to burn and wreak havoc

[I've had enough
I'm taking you down, taking you down
I've had enough
I'm taking you down, taking you down]

Down, down
I'll take you down, down
I'll take you down, down
I'll take you down
Co-co-co-co-come get some
Co-co-co-co-come get some
Co-co-co-co-come get some
Come get some

[I've had enough
I'm taking you down, taking you down
I've had enough
I'm taking you down, taking you down]Embed
