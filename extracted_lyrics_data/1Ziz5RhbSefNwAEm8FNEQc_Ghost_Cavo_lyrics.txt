I'm taking scissors to all of the pictures of us
I'm cutting you out, but it won't be enough
It's never enough
You're still walking through my memories
I'll never solve this mystery
I lie awake with echoes and whispers of you
I'm still haunted by you

And I can't let you go if you've already gone
Can't bring to you life, it's been way too long
Can't move on, just can't start
With the ghost of you in my heart

I see your face, I keep hearing your voice
Holding my breath and remembering every choice
I made a new choice
Now you've taken all the life from me
Living ancient history
I lie awake with echoes and whispers of you
I'm still haunted by you

And I can't let you go if you've already gone
Can't bring you to life, it's been way too long
Can't move on, just can't start
With the ghost of you
You might also like
The walls are closing in, I
Just want this to end, I
Thought you would leave me by now
But here you are again

I'm taking scissors to all of the pictures of us
I'm cutting you out, but it won't be enough
It's never enough

I can't let you go if you've already gone
Can't bring you to life, it's been way too long
Can't move on, just can't start
No, I canâ€™t let you go if you've already gone
Can't bring you to life, it's been way too long
I can't move on, just can't start
With the ghost of you in my heartEmbed
