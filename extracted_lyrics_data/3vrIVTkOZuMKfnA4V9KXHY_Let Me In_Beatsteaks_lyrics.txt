Everytime we talk it through, it doesn't get us anywhere
Everytime we talk, we lose we're getting nowhere
Think about all that you feel
Think about all that you give
Think about all that we get

So let me in
We'll sort it out
So let me in
I know your doubts
But let me in
Don't leave me out
So let me in

Everytime we look at things, it never seems to measure up
Everytime we tore it down, we lost so much
Think about all that I feel
Think about all that I give
Think about all that we've got

So let me in
We'll sort it out
So let me in
I know your doubts
But let me in
Don't leave me out
So let me in
You might also like

So let me in
We'll sort it out
So let me in
I know your doubts
But let me in
Don't leave me out
So let me in
