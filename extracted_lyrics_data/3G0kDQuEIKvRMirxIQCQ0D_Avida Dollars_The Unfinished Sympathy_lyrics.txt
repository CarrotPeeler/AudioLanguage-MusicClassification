1 ContributorAvida dollars LyricsStanding tall over the blame
You're running from the start
Your engine's full of rage
So wrong, so raw
You think you're gonna be cool
When everyone turn their heads?
You're beautiful like scars
All that you owe
Seems it's crumbling
Sounds like thunder
Creep straight over the edge
You'll never get that far
Slip instead of walk
So blind, so blind
You think they're gonna be fooled
As your twisted thought operates
You better take advice
All that you owe
Seems it's crumbling
Sounds like thunder
All that you owe
Took you over
Avida Dollars
Get your cash fast and give it
As the earth needs your art sublime
One by one, all the pieces
Of your mansion falling down
Build it up, build it up
As all the cops lay down tonight
Heard you say "Avida Dollars"
Well you just named me right
The Unfinished Sympathy - Avida Dollars
The Unfinished Sympathy - Avida Dollars
The Unfinished Sympathy - Avida Dollars
Standing tall over the blame
You're running from the start
Your engine's full of rage
So wrong, so raw
You think you're gonna be cool
When everyone turn their heads?
You're beautiful like scars
All that you owe
Seems it's crumbling
Sounds like thunder
Creep straight over the edge
You'll never get that far
Slip instead of walk
So blind, so blind
You think they're gonna be fooled
As your twisted thought operates
You better take advice
All that you owe
Seems it's crumbling
Sounds like thunder
All that you owe
Took you over
Avida Dollars
Get your cash fast and give it
As the earth needs your art sublime
One by one, all the pieces
Of your mansion falling down
Build it up, build it up
As all the cops lay down tonight
Heard you say "Avida Dollars"
Well you just named me rightYou might also likeEmbed
