5 ContributorsRock With Me Lyrics
Ooh, baby
I know this is madness
A blind man even could see (Even could see)
That there was nothing in you that I need for me
And, Daddy, old man
You're always up on me (Always up on me)
Agreed, you're nice, gentle (Gentle and tight)
Keep on throwing, babe
And I just might take a bite

Come on, rock with me, rock with me
Oh, baby, roll with me, roll with me, darlin'
Come on and dance with me, dance with me
Just do it all night long, all night long

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ayy-ayy-ayy-ayy
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, fella, you claim you adore me
It's all mighty talk with no action (There's no action)
Well, babe, but it's gotta be sweet satisfaction
Ooh, baby, you're one sexy fella
Yes, you are
So you wanna be around, well it could be arranged (Wanna be around)
Don't promise me nothing
How nothing's gonna change
You might also like
And rock with me, rock with me
Come on and roll with me, roll with me, babe
Oh, dance with me, dance with me
Just do it all night long, all night long

Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, mm
Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Ooh-ooh-ooh

Rock with me, babe
Come on and roll with me, roll with me, darling
Yeah, dance with me, dance with me
Come on and do it all night long, all night long
Rock with me, rock with me
Come on and roll with me, roll with me, baby
Well, do dance with me, dance with me
And let's do it all night long, all night long
Rock with me, rock with me
Come on and roll with me, roll with me, baby, ayy
Dance with me, dance with meEmbed
