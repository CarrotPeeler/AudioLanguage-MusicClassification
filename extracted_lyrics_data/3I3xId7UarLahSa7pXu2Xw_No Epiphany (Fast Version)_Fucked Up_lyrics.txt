53 ContributorsThe Next Rap God 2 Lyrics
Ten minutes was the warmup, nigga, get in tune
You wanna beef? Let's meet, hit my Zoom
I'm callin' shots, you in the bleachers mournin' every move
I kill 'em with success, I'm up next like afternoon
You niggas evenin' the playin' scale, it's like the moon
Tryna sunset as the nightmare I rap resumes
You get eclipsed, and then I star in the movie (LexNour)
Where the underdog leaves the wholе game straight confused
You think you rappin' with a God, you must be crazy, nigga
Onе song for my deluxe is all I need to do
These puppies barkin', they done bit off more than they can chew
My album just dropped, I'm already back for round two
This here for shits and giggles, here's an epiphany
Dax ain't droppin' music when he's rappin', he's droppin' symphonies
I make Mozart than most, my key lyrically
Is noted on a scale above the whole industry, it's Dax
I got bars out in Georgia
Twenty-minute songs'll probably Illinois ya
I got PTSD from the killin's of these beats, I'm a veteran
I came in the game like a soldier, I could sun you like Barbosa
Me and Nash playin' soccer out in Canada, that's Trudeau
I ain't never lied in my prime, how I minister the flow is unknown
They don't know where it's comin' from like phone calls with star 69
They say I say nothin', that I'm corny and outdated
If I rapped in the '90s, I'd probably be famous
That the flow and the cadence is abrasive
I be blackin' out on beats, even niggas started callin' me a racist
Like Aunt Jemima
I need an Oscar, they admire my wiener
They blowin' me like Hurricane Katrina
I get Superdome defenses tryna find a way to stop me
I'm offensive with the wordplay, I minored misdemeanors
Bitch, you might need a subpoena to see me, like John Cena
High jab ya, huh, then wrap you like a turban
Pack a Stan in a can and ship him to Eminem
And say "Dax needs a feature" and pray that it's not a burden, why?
Because I rap in cursive
They treat my lyrics like the Bible, the OG and the King James Version
This colloquial, my verses speak 'hood and suburban
So the people in the 'jects still respect my sermons
Merge it, LeapFrog it, Kermit
You want a pass, you'll need a permit
Lyrically, I'm drivin' drunk how I'm swervin'
In and out of genres, I ain't pop or urban
I'm my own category, you can call that shit purpose, listen
I need to get this off my chest
You a bitch if I'm rappin' and you say you not impressed
Your input does not add money to my check
Who the fuck about to do this and not even break a sweat?
Man, they committin' genocide tryna exterminate the lyricist
While saying Dax is the antithesis
That's means opposite, but if I'm the opposite
Then how am I independent and the game's still profitin'?
It's not supposed to happen, they cappin'
I'm a goddamn savage when rappin'
Gas mask yo' casket 'cause the smoke I spit will give you lung damage
If you wanna come and grab what I'm grabbin', you'll have to lift weights and wait
'Cause the tectonic plate shift I create is so great
That by the time you reach me the earth quakes
The booth was my birthplace, I'm used to the static
They say I got drive, I'm auto-matic
Ain't listenin' to demos, especially not 'cratics
These niggas panic like we at the disco
I got a simple plan for you
We should rage against the machine, I'ma need a team
I'm two and a half men myself, like Charlie Sheen
This industry's sick, Dax is the vaccine
Top five in this bitch, at least the past three
If they say otherwise, they anti-vaccine
And the mandate passed suppresses they free speech
'Cause I'm in a different category
My whole life is a allegory
The truth I speak is a double-edge
And that's why there's no matrimony
Everybody knows what I came to do
So they separate, and the alimony
Is why I'm broke, but I don't care because my impact is mandatory
In a age of fake and I'm perplexed by the hate
Why flex in your songs if they carry no weight?
If my shit's trash but spreads at this rate
Then maybe it's you who has no taste
And I don't normally pray, but today I'll say
"Dear God, please wash these lames away"
And ironically, that's the name of my song
That's gold with no fuckin' radio play
Now it's back to the topic, let me hit you wit' a switch
How the fuck I'm pussy if you always on my dick?
I don't rap about the typical, my money or a bitch
And if I ever do flex, I'm in the gym doin' lifts
I don't pack nothin' but six, my abs stay ripped
I'm like an ad lib, bitch, I stay in the mix
Every time I see a beat in my scope, it's a hit
State of mind like a shooter for the New York Knicks
I'm the best, and if they ask Kawhi like the Clips
Tell 'em Dax got a glove with the game in his grip
Throwin' counterpunches, hooks, metaphorically the shit
Like a potty mouth nigga with a stank upper lip, and
This wasn't planned
I'm spittin' facts from a real-world scan
They cable, I'm streamin', they nice
But the difference, they can't do it on demand, I'm the man
B-b-bombin' on these beats if you tally up the bands
Got enough ammunition to supply the Taliban
Every bar is like a bullet, they go doo-doo!
People try to Dodge, but they can't like a fuckin' caravan
Okay, now I'm warmed up, I can feel the sweat
The bars drip and turn complex
Hit the floor as I gas the beat, then evaporate and condense
In a generation where common sense is not common sense
We need a real rapper, but when you say Nas
They think you mean Lil Nas X and that's not a diss
I don't want to get canceled, YouTube, don't take my channel
Don't copyright, 'cause if you do I'll strike and beat at you
I'm sick and somethin' you can't handle
I'm solar like a panel
You can't desert me like a camel
I was built for this and somethin' they cannot dismantle
Man, this is appallin', I bounce back like Spalding
I slide on these beats, my flows icy and my bars toboggans
If rap's a house, I'm home alone like Macaulay Culkin
And if you think you better, then rap about it and stop talkin', hot doggin'
I actually play basketball
I'm gettin' buckets if they ever say that Dax ballin'
I see them postin' who's the best hoop rap artist
Like I ain't led a whole goddamn college conference
This shit is wild, I see the posts and profiles
But commentin' negativity is not my style
I got a strap and I ain't talkin' 'bout a gun
It's a hoop term, dummy, go ahead, you can check my file
I been squeaky clean, see, I don't want to go to jail
But if I did, I know it'd triple all my sales
And that's the fucked up part about this life
Don't nobody wanna see you do good 'til you goin' through hell
And that's why I had to make this
Twenty-minute rap song, I'm 'bout to one-take it
I just made my first album
Full of songs from the depths of my heart, and these people didn't appreciate it
You might also like
I should've rapped about guns and violence
Or fuckin' bad bitches on an island
Or some drugs that I don't even take, heh
Then tell all the kids to try it
Man, what's its gon' take to make it?
For them to say that I'm one of the greatest?
Do I gotta go sell my soul?
And live the rest of my life forsaken?
Don't push me, 'cause I just might do it
I go dumb, but I've never been stupid
I've had nothin' in my life before, and I was fine
So, bitch, I'm not afraid to lose it

So, fuck this music, I don't need it
Call me cocky or call me conceited
Smooth criminal, I'm a demon
I Mike Jacked 'em, now they gotta beat it
I throw up hits, heh, I'm bulimic
Shoutout to Drake—why? I stay schemin'
Started from the bottom, now the views I'm seein'
Mean nothin' was the same, and I'm no longer dreamin'
Man, this already a classic, yeah
I'm the future, so you can't look past it
If you take that mask off you could tell that I'm the baddest
Report cards the only time in life you'll see Dax beside the word "average"
And I bet you I'm above, go add 'er all together, I ain't talkin' bout the drug
And you know it's orange juice if they say a C-plus
If you think I'm a 50, then you got no sense like the famous rap song that is called "In Da Club"
Calm down, let me bust a rhyme and kick flips while I'm on my grind
I got tricks up my sleeve, I could make a simile disappear like the line inside this line
And every time I rhyme, they see an Optimus in his prime
I transform, I could reach the blind
My mind's design is one of a kind, you'll find
There is no one like I and that is I why
I must keep it goin', constant motion, locomotive
I lack promotion, I provoke 'em
Break down every system but still be growin'
So sick that they might need some Ibuprofen
Off the deep end, bars with the depths of oceans
Sub-zero flow, so you know it's frozen
IQ so high feels like I'm smokin'
Most impotent man who is spittin' potent
Face off with The Rock like a real Samoan
Tech N9ne with the chop, Midwest influence
That's congruent, payin' my respects, I'm never out of pocket
Name another young gun who is this polished
I spit fury, entice 'em with this rocket
Bars get to droppin' everywhere like I'm bronze bombin'
You couldn't put me in a box if we boxin'
BTS shots the only time Dax K-poppin'
Stick on my hip, I'll clean the whole room
But don't be alarmed, it's Dax, I'm just moppin'
That's off-topic, let me tell you somethin' real
Everything you see now was done with no deal
What does that mean? It's fuck how you feel
'Cause it's impossible to get this far with no skill (Skill, skill, skill, skill, skill, skill)
Never mind, you won't find no one like me
I wish

That you would see me for what I am
Instead of ignorant top comments you see on the 'Gram
I'm a once-in-a-lifetime type of man
Who actually cares 'bout the content and all the fans
I guess it doesn't matter, they piss poor, weak bladder
I gotta keep them at bay like the Packers
Don't stare, 'cause you'll need a ladder
They pass words around like computer hackers
I'm built different, I was never breastfed
When I was two years old, I was dropped on my head
In school like Dej Loaf, they'd try me
But just like the second part of her name, I was all about the bread
So, I stayed focused, I couldn't afford to fumble
Wrestlin' demons in my bed like the Royal Rumble
Paid dues, they ain't never gave me a bundle
But they discount people who would fuckin' mumble
This life is not fair, they dread Dax like Jamaican hair
Because they know they can't compare
Then stock my work and resell it on the market
And give Dax no shares
What the fuck? I'm 'bout to slide like a hockey puck, duck like Donald
Shoot like LeBron and tax niggas like Obama
Do the stanky leg and heat it up like a sauna
While you talk to yo' God and have to deal with yo' karma
As-salamu alaykum, I come in peace
I love all religions and practice what I preach
If you came into this world and you bleed, you're like me
'Cause love is my religion, and I love what I see
I'm not a Christian rapper, I just rap about faith
Without takin' the Bible and throwin' it in your face
And ironically, when you do it that way
More people end up saved
I paved my way by scrapin' it
You ain't never seen a nigga like me, if you did, I guarantee they was on some label shit
They want me to leaf, I'm not rakin' it, twenty minutes, bitch, this my statement
Halfway and I'm just warmin' up, now I'm 'bout to freak this like some pussy I'm playin' with
I'm 'bout give you that energy, uh
They know Dax sick, but he also the remedy, yeah
If they say I'm trash they smokin' methamphetamine, yeah
This here my destiny, yeah
Pussy nigga, you an enemy, never was a friend to me
Hundred different flows like a muthafuckin' centipede, it's Dax!
My path's a lonely road, I walk alone, and I keep my eyes closed
I don't fuck wit' you broke hoes, I'd rather jack off inside my home
I can already see the fake, they rise quick then fall like Easy Bake
Then resurrect like Christ on Easter Day, they straight ass, I ain't talkin' about a piece of cake
Uh, I'm turnin' up the concentration
Free in this bitch, but I'm not a mason
Came in the game and the beats I'm blazin'
Bring heat that'll torch and destroy the matrix
Line after line, got 'em snortin' greatness
Raw spelt backwards is what I'm wagin'
Dax is the brand and the occupation
Occupies the real so the constant hatin'
Comes from the fake who deny the basic
That Dax is a part of the conversation
With no cosign or major playlists
Radio play or talent agent
Anger and rage 'cause they can't contain it
Straight to top, and the spot is vacant
Those who oppose go straight to hell, hah
And go twerk with Satan
I'm spittin' it mad fast, I ain't gonna backtrack
My flow's in a hazmat, I'm fixin' to blow
Game in a backpack, they spittin' the rap cap
They know what they doin', and they tryna be clones
I'm ice cold, no Steve Stone
Unless you're in Austin, Texas
WWE, you niggas restless
You are not getting in, you're not on my guest list
Don't fit like Tetris, I'm 'bout to make this flip
Anybody hatin' can come and suck my dick
Everything I spit is like glue, it sticks
When you poop's the only time you're the shit
Everybody wanna just get rich
You're all my sons just like Chris
I'm appalled 'cause you always miss
And if you hit, you still can't do it like this
And if you did your brain would explode, I'm next to blow
I'm a whole series, you're just an episode
Gimme legume, heh, like a vegetable
Beatin' me is a stretch, you better get flexible
Killin' this beat, but the crime is sensible
First-degree, I murder thee, then mastermind then PhD
My schemes are credible
So the rhymes may not be detectable
Over heads, they go and fall on deaf ears
The buzz I made's beyond lightyears
So when they're toxic like Britney Spears
I barely hear 'cause I just switch gears
You ain't never seen a rapper strike this much fear
Amongst his foes and his so-called peers
So, like Visine drops, let me make this clear
I'm Dax, and I been in a different tier
And it's fire, fire, call for help
My desire burns and they passion melts
Independent, so I might not be felt
But I sign my checks, that's a higher self
Don't pull my card 'cause you might get dealt
My hand of God's from the Bible Belt
My wave's so big even Michael Phelps
Can't swim my shit without some help
So breathe, huh-huh, huh-huh
You might need a second to catch up
Dax is on a tear, and they're lookin' for backup
Semi-automatic, and I hit like a Mack truck
Breathe, huh-huh, huh-huh
And I don't give a flying fat fuck
Yes, I am a sinner, and I drink and do cuss
But like DJ Khaled, I got the keys
To unlock the beast
Extend my reach from down beneath
And knock off those who cannot compete
But want to act like they can fuck with me
It's OK-K-K like racial tension
"Dax nice, let's avoid him and never mention
He'll elevate to a new dimension
And leave us here in the kiddy section"
Sixty-five metaphors, where's my pension?
I retire beats and they go to heaven
Appraise them, not like a reverend
I mean raise their value
I'm still here like a statue starin' at you, I will stand the test of time
And if I sit I'll still be twice as tall with my head in the sky
Lookin' down at all you birds
Who talk on Twitter thinkin' there's power behind your words?
Callin' me corny behind your computer in the fuckin' suburbs
Hahahaha, hahahahaha, haha
You're way too late, heh I've mastered this, and now I'm better than great, heh heh, uh
In fact, I might just be top five all-time, or at least top ten, well, maybe nine
Minus five, divided by two, minus the amount times we all get to live this life
That's one, don't waste it
You'd be way more successful with Dax on your playlist
'Cause I rap about motivation, which you lack
'Cause if you focused on yourself, you wouldn't have time to go online, spend your time there, heh, just to shit on Dax
Oh, it's sad, you know I've never had someone more successful tell me I'm wack
And, oh, I forgot I'm black so I'm supposed to rap about guns, bitches, clothes, and tons of cash
While you pricks pray I lose my shit, while you sit at home and clap
And that's the kicker, heh
You don't even get paid to hate, heh, heh on Twitter, heh
It just makes you bitter, and my skin gets thicker and it actually promotes my work
Indirectly and over a period of time you sheep herd and all just make me richer
I got you in a bind like a boa constrictor
I'm on the way up like a zipper and only fade in the cut with a pair of clippers
But I'm no clown, my shit's real
And that's why despite how you feel, it all still spreads around
Up and down with resoundin' sound
Even haters got to admit that Dax got that bounce
Boy, you better run home when you see me, I don't mean a baseball mound
I'm the king in this bitch, that's why I let my hair grow in the shape of a crown
You better bow down then get up, I won't let up or let go
I take the hate they throw and embody it for the energy to go turn up at my sold-out shows across the globe
South Africa, Nigeria
Zambia, Liberia
Canada, I need Expedia
And, oh, I got a message for the media
I don't care if that fake shit feedin' ya
You a sellout if you glorify that trash that does not meet the criteria
I'm a patriot, I've united states
Every bill I check got Buccs and nears Tom Brady's throw completion rate
That's a bar, if you don't get it
But if you did, I have to explain for those who still give me no credit
Well, well, well, actually I've got my I got my own money
I've always been a big advocate for debit

I don't obsess over what's not mine, I already think I'm great
They whine about Dax like a large amount of grapes
Then act pregnant like they made me and I popped out way too late
And they never ever recovered from postpartum baby weight
That's not my fault, I did my job and made waves like Rod
I put my heart on ice, and if you slip and fall, I hope you break your jaw
So you can't talk at all and have to cry
Oh, I'm gettin' off track, or maybe I should just go and finish that like No Life Shaq
You want to know what pisses me off the most?
People wanna pretend that they can do what I do
Drop these tracks back-to-back with impeccable raps
Stay humble, move how I move
Hit it on the nail, you're a loose screw
Ain't nobody fuckin' with me in this booth
It's a blatant lie if they try to say I'm not the truth
Inspirational, all relatable, undebatably one of a kind
Intrinsic fire lit inside to match my grind
Critical thinkin' songs that actually make you think about your life
Fuck attention spans, my music actually stands the test of time
I don't give a fuck about a Grammy, I should've had three
"Dear God", "JOKER", "Book of Revelations"
But these motherfuckers don't want to give it to emcees
Just glorify and push the shit that's empty
I'm at large in this bitch like a Starbucks Venti
Certified-killer, promise you don't want to tempt me
Got the game in a state of rage, a frenzy
If they're speaking on my name and hate, it's envy
I ain't missin' my target unless I'm shoppin' for some bananas
I'm at c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-coco cabanas
K-k-killin' these comics c-c-comin' at me with cameras
Don't c-c-c-c-call me 'less you callin' Colin, you cappin'
I'm a c-c-c, c-c-chemist c-c-cookin' everything
You c-cook 'cause I'm a menace
Dax is a Clause like Santa, but independent
My world is a series, I don't mean the Pennant, heh
They probably think that I'll run out of bars
But I'm a galaxy, and I got as many as the stars
I'm an extraterrestrial alien and I'm on Mars
And I'm comin' back to Earth to rid you of these retards
Man, I hope they don't cancel me for that
Cancel culture is a bitch
You can say anything you want
As long you're not rich
But if you're poor, oh, they might get you, too
Because if you ever become successful, they'll use your past against you
We can't even be human, we can't even make mistakes
Everyone's a dick, but won't come say it to your face
We spend our lives looking left and right while we run our race
Then wonder why we're depressed and always finish shit in second place
Get up and get gone, you ain't right if you're doin' nothin' wrong
Get off of that phone, find a Korea like Kim Jong-Un
Find your passion and cash in like Kim Kardashian
And bask in the fact that it takes action to be a massive attraction
And stay active instead of bein' passive, reach out and go grab it and make habits
Fuck status, you'll stay static, just march, no madness
This bracket is an elite synapsis, all info passed has been imagined
No draggin' if you wanna get cash then start smashin'
Instead of waitin' 'til you're in a casket
And braggin' on what happened in the past
Of your life as the basic average
Be a savage, attack it, rip it, slash it, cremate it
Take its ashes and smoke it, gas it so hard that the pedal smashes
Stop livin' in captions, you're better than that, you have it, addict
Like Go-Go Gadget, you're equipped to wreak havoc, emphatic
I'm 'bout to weaponize a generation
This road I'm blazin' got my enemies wishin' they had never tried to  crack the pavement
Poetic justice, everybody's here in my arraignment
Murder to Goliath, and I am fuckin' David
You couldn't save 'em with the flash drive
Don't question a Mark, he a snitch if you ask why
Whole generation lost, you can check the spectrum
My connection isn't there like they low-bar WiFi
I'm not a part of this shit, I'll never celebrate ignorance
I'm on the border like undocumented immigrants
Tryna decide if I should stay in the village
Or risk it to benefit but have to move militant
If you're hatin', you're a child
You don't understand the Dax impact, and you won't for a while
But once you get old, and this life gets real
You'll wanna go back and wish my words touched you like a pedophile
You must be crazy if you think I'ma stop
I was hip without hip-hop
Between the lines, I could read the signs
They don't want music, they want songs that'll get a whole generation locked
So, I stay back and push my little positive message
Isolated from the game up in the nosebleed section
No awards or recognition, but my state of correction
Facilitates the people chained to get a bit up in heaven
And that's a felony
Even amnesia couldn't make them not remember me
The word meme is short for memories
So, when you tryna break what I've made
Keep in mind you helpin' me build a legacy
And that's why I'm right in they face, somethin' they cannot erase
Take copy and paste, penning these verses and eight
The penmanship I exude is of dystopian taste
Characterized by world issues full of drama and pain
Me, Picasso, and Da Vinci are of similar grain
The reality I paint is vivid, wicked, ingrained
Into the skull of every human who allows me to take
Them on a trip where the pictures aren't perfectly framed
Crooked, cracked and maimed, full of anger and rage
Spat on with graffiti, lit in fiery flames
From the mind of a human who is fuckin' deranged
And goin' down in history as one of the greats
And that's a fact
And to think this all came from an epiphany
Overnight janitor to poet to songs to moments
And now, finally, symphonies, it's Dax

Fuckin' up everybody who put me in a category
Thinkin' I was never gonna make it
If we talkin' 'bout the lyrics or the cadence or the meanin' of the songs
There's not another approachin' what I've been makin'
I've been sittin', waitin', innovatin', I'm patient, I'm waitin' to bust
Deliberatin' on what I should come and beat in the cut
People say that they better, they better never endeavor
Or even sever the lever to try to get a go
Get a second amendment, aggressive in every direction
Spit venom, there's no defendin', I'll tell I'm independent
Pennin' with vengeance, the time on attention is iridescent
And shinin' like the brighter luminescent
And I'm tired of lululemon retention, first go, second-guessin'
They get to bendin' like back on my Dax, kickin' the definition
Of bods, and riddin' the fold, hawks, and pick us up
With the claws, and grippin' with the intention of deficit
And disorder like ADD, kinda sorta and I soda-popped
Don't mean cola, a Star War don't mean Yoda
A Florida, Pensacola, there's more to roll-a by Motorola
I'm in control-a, I hit the quota
I made this freestyle while I was in Minnesots—

Fuck, fuck! Minnesota
What are we at? What are we at, bro?
Twenty minutes, man
Ha, for real?
For real, bro
Heh, heh, oh, alright, well
Let's try one that's an hour, heh3Embed
