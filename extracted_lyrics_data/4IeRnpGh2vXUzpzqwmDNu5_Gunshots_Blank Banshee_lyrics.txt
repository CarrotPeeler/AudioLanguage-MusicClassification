10 ContributorsGunshots LyricsHold your medal up
Hold your baby for the camera
You won the war
Hold your baby for the camera
You won the war
But for two long years
You hear Gunshots
Shots
You hear gunshots
Oh
It sort of
Hold your medal up
Hold your baby for the camera
You won the war
But for two long years
You hear Gunshots
Shots
You hear gunshots
Shots
When you comin' home?

It can can't kill you
But for two long years
You hear gunshots
Shots

Killed you, it killed you1Embed
