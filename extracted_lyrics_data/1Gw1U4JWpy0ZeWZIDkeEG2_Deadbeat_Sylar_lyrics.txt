Hit 'em up
I said hit 'em up

When your true colors showed
Your fate to me was very clear
Look at the life that you have
(Laid to waste, laid to waste)
Laid to waste
Slipping up, losing control
Your fate to me was very clear
No, I don't want you here
Stay away
You won't drag me down
This isn't my weight to carry
You're on your own now
You're on your own now

They say success is the best revenge
So here's a toast to all the things
You never helped us get
I confide, I confide
In it all here without you
You might also like
Pockets full of wishes
Lack of life
Pockets full of wishes
Lack of life
Checkmate
I hold the crown
I'll stay on top
While you sink and drown
This isn't my weight to carry
You're on your own now
You're on your own now

They say success is the best revenge
So here's a toast to all the things
You never helped us get
I confide, I confide
In it all here without you

A simple look in my eyes
Will drive you crazy inside
My voice creeps deep in your mind
A simple look in my eyes
Will drive you crazy inside
My voice creeps deep in your mind
A simple look in my eyes
Will drive you crazy inside
My voice creeps deep in your mind
A simple look in my eyes
Will drive you crazy inside
My voice creeps deep in your mind
Yo, break your fucking neck
A simple look in my eyes
Will drive you crazy inside
My voice creeps deep in your mind
A simple look in my eyes
Will drive you crazy inside
My voice creeps deep in your mind
