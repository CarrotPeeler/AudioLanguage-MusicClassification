1 ContributorStay LyricsWritten by Julia Fordham
I have been imagining myself
Under you over you outside you
I have been happy in my thinking
Drive me to the mountains
Take me to the sea
You be strong and beautiful
And I'll try not to be me
With my complications
With my don'ts and dos
You be kind and wonderful
And I'll be good to you
If you feel brave and you ask me I'll say
Stay, stay, stay, stay
Safe beneath these clean white sheets I dream
I'm under you over you outside you
I have been happy in my dreaming
Kiss me in the morning
Hold me though the night
Whisper that it's okay
And I'll believe you're right
Steer me from the shadows
Lead me to the light
Push your hand in my hand
And I won't put up a fight
You might also likeIf you feel brave and you ask me I'll say
Stay, stay, stay, stay
Under you over you outside you
Stay, carry me away
Come on, stayEmbed
