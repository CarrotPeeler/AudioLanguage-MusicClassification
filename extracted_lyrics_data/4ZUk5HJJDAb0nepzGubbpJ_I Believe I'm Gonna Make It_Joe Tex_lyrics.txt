1 ContributorI Believe Iâ€™m Gonna Make It Lyrics
When I got your letter, baby
I was in a foxhole on my knees
Oh yes, I was
And your letter brought me so much strength
Tell you what I did, baby
Ha-ha, you won't believe it
I raised up and got me
Two more enemies, oh yes, I did
Listen, that's why

That I believe that I'm gonna make it
Tell everybody back home (I believe I'm gonna make it)
I believe that I'm gonna make it
And baby, I'll be home
Before you can say "Jackie Robinson"
Oh yes I will, yes I will

Sometimes I wonder
Do you really love me?
Then I'll think of something sweet you once said to me
And the thought makes me feel so good inside
I raise up and get me two more enemies
Oh yes I will, alright
You might also like
Listen, baby
Ooh, oh baby
I wished a thousand times
That we had gotten married
Before I left home for Vietnam
But then when I see so many of my buddies
Gettin' shot down all around me
Makes me kinda glad that we waited
Because I don't wanna leave you
At home being a widow, no
I know you understand, baby
Listen, darling
They promised me a furlough
On the fifteenth of next month
And I want you to say a prayer tonight
That my furlough'll come through
So I can come home to be with you
And tomorrow, oh tomorrow
Go by and tell my mom and daddy that I love 'em
And for 'em not to worry about me
Listen

'Cause I believe that I'm gonna make it
Tell everybody back home (I believe I'm gonna make it)
I believe that I'm gonna make it
And baby, I'll be home
Before you can say "Batman and Robin", yeahEmbed
