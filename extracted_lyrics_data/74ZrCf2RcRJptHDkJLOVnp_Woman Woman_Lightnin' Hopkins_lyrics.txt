Whoa, she won'te treat nobody right
Yeah, She's an evil-hearted woman
She won'te treat nobody right
She get mad late in the evening
That woman she'll be gone all night
Lord, I've been a-wondering what make my baby so evil
Some time to wonder what make her so mean
Whoa
Some time what make her so mean
Yeah, you know she's just an evil-hearted woman
Meanest little girl that I've ever seen
One more time I gotta tell you evil-hearted woman
I ain't gonna ever tell you no
Just gotta sound all right now
Little bold lightnin' gotta let you goYou might also likeEmbed
