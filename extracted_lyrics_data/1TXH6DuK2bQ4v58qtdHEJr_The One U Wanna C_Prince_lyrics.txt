8 ContributorsThe One U Wanna C Lyrics
I know I ain't the first to tell you
I sure bet I won't be the last
I know you're in a hurry, baby
So let me make this fast

I got a lot of money
I don't want to spend it on me
I like pretty things
You're just as pretty as you can be
So if you ain't busy later
And you want some company
I ain't trying to be a hater
I'm the one, I'm the one, the one you wanna see
You wanna see
You see

Look around you, baby
You know you've seen it all before
Every nickel in this club looking for a dime
Nothing less, nothing more
Too tall to be talked down to
Too over it to be put under
Any spell a blind fisherman could cast
That's why I come like thunder to tell you
You might also like
I got a lot of money
But I don't want to spend it on me
I like pretty things
And you're just as pretty as you can be (oh, oh)
So if you ain't busy later
And you want some company
I ain't trying to be a hater
But I'm the one, I'm the one, the one you want to see
You want to see


You don't need to fix your hair
For somebody you don't care for
You don't need to shave your legs
If it ain't me that's knocking at your door, oh
I know you ain't a concubine
I know you ain't a one night stand
I don't wanna waste your time

If you wanna get creamy
I'm the one you wanna see
Ooh, the one you wanna see, baby
Oh, the one you wanna see
I'm the one you wanna see
Coming on you like thunder
I'm the one you wanna seeEmbed
