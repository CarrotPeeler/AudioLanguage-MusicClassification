Let the music play just a little longer
Let the music play just a little longer

Let the music play just a little longer
Just a little longer
Let me hold her in my arms
Let me thrill to all her charms
A little longer
Make the music play just a little slower
Just a little slower
Let me hear her tender sighs
Let me look into her eyes
A little longer

Make the music play (Make the music play)
Keep this magic going
Keep those trumpets blowing
All through the night
Don't ever skip a beat, for
She may slip away, and if we were parted
I'd be broken hearted
Till she's in my arms to stay
Forever and a day
Please let the music play

Till she's in my arms to stay
Forever and a day
Please let the music play
Woah yeah, please let the music play, yeah, yeah
Please let the music play, mmm
Woah yeah, please let the music play
Woah yeah, please let the music play...Embed
