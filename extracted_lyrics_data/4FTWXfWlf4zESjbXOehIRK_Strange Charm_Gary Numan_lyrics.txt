I don't know, I don't know
The dream was everything
I don't know, I don't know
If it's all falling down
I don't like it, I don't like it
I lose connection as they let me down
I don't like it, I don't like it
I lose connection as they let me down

What you gonna think?
What you gonna do?
What you gonna say?
Are you gonna scream "Oh, no"?
What you gonna think?
What you gonna do?
What you gonna say?
I just don't like this thing (at all)
(Strange charm)

Let the boys out, let the boys out
And let the fun begin
Let the boys out, let the boys out
And let the night come in
We don't like it, we don't like it
We're from the factory and we've come to play
We don't like it, we don't like it
We're from the factory and we've come to play
Let the boys out, let the boys out
You might also like
What you gonna think?
What you gonna do?
What you gonna say?
Are you gonna scream "Oh, no"?
What you gonna think?
What you gonna do?
What you gonna say?
I just don't like this thing (at all)
(Strange charm)

You push too hard, you push too hard
Come closer, talk to me
You push too hard, you push too hard
D'you get the picture now?
You won't like it, you won't like it
We get impatient as the time runs out
You won't like it, you won't like it
We get impatient as the time runs out
Let the boys out, let the boys out

What you gonna think?
What you gonna do?
What you gonna say?
Are you gonna scream "Oh, no"?
What you gonna think?
What you gonna do?
What you gonna say?
I just don't like this thing (at all)
(Strange charm)Embed
