1 ContributorThe Teacher LyricsGood morning, children
I'm glad to see you here, na na na na
You're growing older daily
There's something you must hear
Two, three, four
I'm your teacher, children, and I think you realise
Your elders are too wise to be opposed
I'm your teacher, children, and I know you will not mind
Being treated as the blind by someone like me who knows
A scholar I suppose
Now I'm going to count to three
And you'll be following me
I'll show you through a door you've never been through before
But you'll be there
You're sitting comfortably
Don't be afraid of me
I'll show you what to do, you know it's nothing new
Why should you care?
Now we're going to repeat yesterday's lesson
After me: a-one two three four five six seven eight nine ten!
A-one two three four five six seven eight nine ten
One two three four five six seven eight nine ten

I'm going to stimulate the brain of this traffic light
And if he thinks nice things it will go "Boo!"
But if he thinks horrible nasty things, then it will go
"Yay! Yippee!"
Now let's begin!Embed
