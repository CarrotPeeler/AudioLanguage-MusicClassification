3 ContributorsAll I Care About Is You LyricsWell I don't care what you did in the past
I just don't care and I'm having a blast
And I don't care what all those bastards say about us
All I care about is you
Love and art will see us through
Just take me to the movies and
Hold my hand
All I care about is love
Greater than the stars above
Though it may seem
Just like a dream
It's realer than the world is
And I don't care if you don't want to go slow
And I don't care about stuff I don't know
I just don't care 'cause if it's not weird, it's not romance
All I care about is you
Love and art will see us through
Just take me to the movies and
Hold my hand
All I care about is love
Greater than the stars above
Though it may seem
Just like a dream
It's realer than the world is
You might also likeAnd I don't care if it's all in my head
And I don't care if it's complicated
Suddenly I don't wish I were dead anymore
All I care about is you
Love and art will see us through
Just take me to the movies and
Hold my hand
All I care about is love
Greater than the stars above
Though it may seem
Just like a dream
It's realer than the world is
All I care about is you
Love and art will see us through
Just take me to the movies and
Hold my handEmbed
