4 ContributorsPlease Please Please (Young Hollywood) LyricsYou scream louder than fiction
And you get down on your knees
And tear open your heart
So I can love you and your disease
You lick the hand that feeds you
And kiss the blade that cuts
I wanna fuck you when your gods hands
When your praying bites the dust
Please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please
Let me anoint the lust inside you
Please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please
Let me devalue what's inside you
Hollywood at night
Hanging around
If this is a must
Then dying is a must right now
Hollywood at night
Hanging around
If this is a must
Then dying is a must right now
And I'll deny you
Fact or fiction, fact or fiction, fact or fiction
It's a mission to survive
And learn to want you
When I hate, when I hate
What's all inside
