1 ContributorBig Hair LyricsBig hair, where you goin?
You got room in the back of that GTI
I'm on and
I'm hummin'
So get your keys and wind it up big hair
Big hair, you're such a honey
I wanna take you to a pretty place that I know
Where we'll be unmolested
And we can jump and shout until the morning glow
Make a left at the next junction
Don't stop until I tell you to
Go right by that road-house function
We've got things to do
Well big hair, we'd better hurry
I've got a love for you that I need to share
Come on girl. we'd better worry
About how to get this thing out of second gear
Make a left at the next junction
Don't stop until I tell you to
Go right by that road-house function
We've got things to do
You might also likeWell big hair, we'd better hurry
I've got a love for you that I need to share
Well big hair, we'd better worry
About how to get this thing out of second gear
You'd better wind it up big hair
You'd better grind it out big hair
You'd better shine it up but hair
You'd better twine it up big hairEmbed
