1 ContributorShoot Me LyricsWalking down the street
But I can't move my feet
No more guaranteen
For you but not for me
Thousand pills a day
A million days away
And all the things they say
Just hit to my face
Stuck out in the rain
It's running through my veins
Shoot me with the pain
Until I go Insane
Walls are falling down
Falling down on me
I'm stuck between the sheets
And I can hardly breathe
Stuck out in the rain
It's running through my veins
Shoot me with the pain
It's running trhough my veins
Shoot me with me pain
Shoot me with the pain
Shoot me with the pain
Shoot me with the painYou might also likeEmbed
