3 ContributorsHigh-Heel Sneakers LyricsPut on your hi-heel sneakers
'Cause we're goin' out tonight
Put on your hi-heel sneakers
'Cause we're goin' out tonight
Better wear your boxing gloves
In case some fool might want to fight
Put on your red dress baby
Put that wig hat on your head
Put on your red dress baby
Put that wig hat on your head
Better bring your body guard
I'm pretty sure you're gonna knock 'em dead
Put on your neon jacket
'Cause we're goin' out to cruise
Put on your neon jacket
'Cause we're goin' out to cruise
I saw Spike Lee on the TV
He said "Money, it's the shoes!"You might also likeEmbed
