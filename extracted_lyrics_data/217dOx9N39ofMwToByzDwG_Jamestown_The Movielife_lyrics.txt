5 ContributorsJamestown Lyrics
Focus (focus)
Commitment and trust give in to me
Friendship (friendship)
Forged through broken bones and tragedy
I can't fucking believe
This joke has gotten out of hand
Won't pretend
Won't pretend
I don't feel the break, but I feel the bend

Late night, snowfall
Get us to the hospital
Jamestown, 94 West
And a forty-hour train back to Penn

When leaves fall (when leaves fall)
If it means anything, it just means you're dead
When snow falls (when snow falls)
It means my feet just flew over my head
I can't fucking believe
This joke has gotten out of hand
Won't pretend
Won't pretend
I don't feel the break, but I feel the bend
You might also like
Late night, snowfall
Get us to the hospital
Jamestown, 94 West
And a forty-hour train back to Penn

There's no setback that can set me back
I think the punches wore me thin and I'm weakening
The one thing that keeps me in the ring
Are the people that will never exist to me, to me
If my mind's the weapon, my heart's the extra clip

Late night (late night)
Snowfall (snowfall)
Get us to the hospital
Jamestown, 94 West
And a forty-hour train back to Penn

Withered
Broken
Endure
I'm still fucking hereEmbed
