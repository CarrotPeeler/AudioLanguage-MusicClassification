1 ContributorVinegar & Salt Lyrics
I like the things that you hate
And you hate the things that I like
But it hurts
Honesty's your church

But sometimes
It's better to lie
But sometimes
It's better to lie

I am the vinegar and salt
And you are the oil that dissolves
My frustration
Honesty's limitations

But sometimes
It's better to lie
But sometimes
It's better to lie

But sometimes
(I am the vinegar and salt)
It's better to lie
(And you are the oil that dissolves)
(My frustrations, limitations)
But sometimes
(I am the vinegar and salt)
It's better to lie
(And you are the oil that dissolves)
(My frustrations, limitations)
But sometimes
(I am the vinegar and salt)
But sometimes
(And you are the oil that dissolves)
(My frustrations, limitations)
But sometimes
(I am the vinegar and salt)
But sometimes
(And you are the oil that dissolves)
(My frustrations, limitations)
