1 ContributorShattered Sky LyricsThe universe is in my eye
Scattered are the pages of the word
Everybody's praying to the nothing in the sky
They cry for what they've laid upon the world
This life is mine
I'm living in my time
You gave, you slaved
You thought that you'd be saved
Everybody's looking to the sky
Waiting for the rain to pour into their overflowing hands
Waiting, waiting
This life is mine
I'm living in my time
You gave, you slaved
You thought that you'd be saved
Now you're waiting like the flies
To drag your tongue across my eyes
I claw into my hole all the ashes of my soul
Blue for the shattered sky
Blue for the shattered sky
Now you're waiting like the flies
To drag your tongue across my eyes
I claw into my hole all the ashes of my soul
You might also likeBlue for the shattered sky (of my soul, the ashes of my soul)
Blue for the shattered sky (of my soul, of my soul now)
Blue for the shattered sky
Blue for the shattered sky
Now you're waiting like the flies
To  before the shattered sky
Blue for the shattered sky
Blue for the shattered sky
Blue for the shattered sky
Blue for the shattered sky
Blue for the shatter-Embed
