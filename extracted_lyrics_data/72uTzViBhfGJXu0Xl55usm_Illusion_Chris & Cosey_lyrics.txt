2 ContributorsIllusion LyricsCHORUS:
All we feel is illusion
Looking through our naked eyes
The air talks, the air breathes
But we cannot see
The dream came calling (2x)
CHORUS
Is this illusion? (5x)
We pray to feel what we could not see
We pray to see what we could not feel
Is this illusion? (2x)
The dream came calling (3x)
The air talks, the air breathes
But we cannot see
Is this illusion? (2x)
CHORUS
Is this illusion? (2x)
CHORUS
Is this illusion? (4x)
We pray to feel what we could not see
We pray to see what we could not feel
The dream came calling
The dream came calling
CHORUS
Is this illusion? (2x)
The dream came calling
Is this illusion?
The dream came calling
Is this illusion?You might also likeEmbed
