Sugar babe, I'm tired of you
Ain't your honey but the way you do
Sugar babe, it's all over now
All I want my babe to do
Make five dollars and give me two
Sugar babe, it's all over now
Went downtown and bought me a rope
Whupped my baby till she Buzzard Lope1
Sugar babe, it's all over now
Sugar babe, what's the matter with you?
You don't treat me like you used to do
Sugar babe, it's all over now
Went to town and bought me a line
Whupped my baby till she changed her mind
Sugar babe, sugar babe, it's all over now
Sugar babe, I'm tired of you
Ain't your honey but the way you do
Sugar babe, it's all over nowYou might also likeEmbed
