4 ContributorsIn My Arms Lyrics
The deal is on the rise again
The ship comes into shore
I've been away to somewhere
But life goes on no less

Through the foreign oceans
Underneath the sea

And walls come tumbling down
We'll be forever calm
And you'll be here in my arms
I'll keep you away from harm

I thought about you twice just then
You get me every time
Keeps coming out of nowhere
It cannot be defined

Your colours are magnificent
From magenta to bright blue
You might also like
And walls come tumbling down
We'll be forever calm
And you'll be here in my arms
I'll keep you away from harm


Through the foreign ocean
Underneath the seas

And walls come tumbling down
We'll be forever calm
And you'll be here in my arms
I'll keep you away from harm
(Yeah)
And walls come tumbling down
(Oh)
We'll be forever calm
(Oh)
And you'll be here in my arms
I'll keep you away from harm
(Oh)
And walls come tumbling down
(Oh)
We'll be forever calm
(Oh, yeah)
And you'll be here in my arms
I'll keep you away from harmEmbed
