1 ContributorSlow Burn Treason LyricsWake up and you're next to nothing
But the weight of the world is on your side
Most days you don't even notice
But that's a lie
All you want is her eyes on you
All you need is one hand deep inside
Outside the wind she's screaming
The windows shake and you cry
But who's gonna feel you
And who's gonna need you
And in between there's always someone
They don't get you but you reach and smile
And maybe this slow burn treason
Is better than the crash of a quick rise
So brave the cold and close your mouth
I'll bite your tongue if you'll bite mine
Yeah lay your head on my legs babe
Everything is fine except the time
But who's gonna feel you
And who's gonna need you
Who's gonna feel you
Who's gonna need you
Who's gonna want you
Who's gonna hold you
Who's gonna love you
Who's gonna tease you
