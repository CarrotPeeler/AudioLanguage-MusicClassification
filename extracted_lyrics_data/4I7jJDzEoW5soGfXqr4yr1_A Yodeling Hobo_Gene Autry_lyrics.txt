3 ContributorsA Yodeling Hobo LyricsAhl-dee-oh-lay-eee-hee
Ahl-dee-oh-lay-eee-hee-heee
Ahl-dee-oh-lay-hee-hee, oh-dah-lay-hee-hee
Oh-dah-lay-heee
Tramping down the highway, traveling day and night
I don't know where I'm going to, but I'll get there all right
I have no one to care for me, I have no place to go
Everybody knows I'm just a yodeling hobo
(Yodel)
I've been all around the country, been around most everywhere
But I love that dear ol' sunny South, I love that Texas air
Away out where the men are men, down in El Paso
That is where they call me a yodeling hobo
(Yodel)
All my life I've traveled, I'm Alabama bound
And now I'm always happy in the city or one horse town
I started out to roamin' 'cause I had no place to go
Now I've turned out to be a yodeling hobo
(Yodel)
You might also likeNow you have heard my story, so I'll be on my way
I hear a Frisco freight train, and it's calling me
And when the sun sinks in the West, into that dark blue sky
Just say that I'm a hobo and will be till I die
(Yodel)Embed
