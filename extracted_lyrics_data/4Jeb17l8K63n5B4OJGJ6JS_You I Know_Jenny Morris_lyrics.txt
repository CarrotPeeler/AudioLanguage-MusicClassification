1 ContributorYou I Know LyricsSome men have muscles
They are muscle bound and on display
Some men have money
And a few of them think they can own me
But it's you I know and no one else will do
Yes it's you I know with all you put me through
When I was driftin' down you pulled me up again
And it's you I know, you'll love me to the end
Some men think they're funny
When the laughing stops you're on your own
Some are familiar, before their real intentions are fully shown
Sometimes I wonder if I know myself as well as I know you
But it's you I know and no one else will do
Yes it's you I know with all you put me throu-ough
When I was driftin' down you pulled me up again
And it's you I know, you love me to the end
You could be anything, you could be anything you waant
You could be everywhere, you could be everywhere at o-o-once
You could have anyone, you don't need me to get you goin'
You could have anyone, your sea is full to overflowin'
I've seen them walking - through a market place in Florence
I've heard them singing - in a foreign place in Spanish
Sometimes I wonder if I know myself as well as I know you
You might also likeBut it's you I know and no one else will do
Yes it's you I know with all you put me through
When I was driftin' down you pulled me up again
And it's you I know, you love me to the e-e-end
And it's you I know and no one else will do
Yes it's you I know with all you put me through
When I was driftin' down you pulled me up again
And it's you I know, you love me to the e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-end
To the e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-end
But it's you I know and no one else will do
Yes it's you I know with all youEmbed
