3 ContributorsI Got It Bad (And That Ainâ€™t Good) Lyrics
The poets say that all who love are blind
But I'm in love and I know what time it is
The good book go seek and ye shall find
Well, I have sought, and my, what a climb it is
My life is just like the weather, it changes with the hours
When he's near, I'm fair and warmer
When he's gone, I'm cloudy with showers
An emotion like the ocean, it's either sink or swim
When a woman loves a man like I love him

Never treats me sweet and gentle
The way he should
I got it bad and that ain't good

My poor heart is sentimental
Not made of wood
I got it bad and that ain't good

But when the weekend's over
And Monday rolls around
I end up like I start out
Just crying my heart out
You might also like
He don't love me like I love him
No, nobody could
I got it bad and that ain't good


So bad, so bad
I got it so bad, so bad
The folks with good intentions
Tell me to save my tears
I'm glad I'm mad about him
I can't live without him

Lord above me make him love me
The way he should
Like a lonely weeping willow lost in the wood
The things I tell my pillow no woman should
I got it bad, bad
So bad and that ain't goodEmbed
