3 ContributorsThe Uncomfortable Truth LyricsThe time has come for you to see
That love is something else than you practice it to be
The line is long for you and me
That leads us to the very depth of our hearts
We're still, on the surface, deceiving ourselves
Inside, we hate and want to see our best friends fall
So, let us make a change
Why can't we turn the page
Lord, make us able
Without you, we are totally unstable
Let us make a change
Why can't we turn the page
Lord, make us able
Without you, we are totally unstable
You talk 'bout peace
Put it in your mouth
The same mouth you use to declare your bombs
Your system is a joke
No heart in it
It's choking us to death
We live in decept
So tell me, oh please, tell me that
(Love) ain't what you're talking about on TV
(Love) ain't what you practice it to be
(Love) ain't the love that you are giving me
(Love) got t'be something you cannot compare anything to
