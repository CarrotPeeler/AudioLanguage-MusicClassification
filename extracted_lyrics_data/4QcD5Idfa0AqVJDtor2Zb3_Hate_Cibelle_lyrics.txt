'Cause I know you love me too but we gotta leave
I love you so much when you're near
Yet I hate you so bad when you make love at me
I hate you so bad when you're "nule"
'Cause I know you wanna say things but you never do
I love you so much when you're inside me
Yet I hate you so bad when your eyes I can't see
I love you so much
When I hate you so bad
'Cause I love you so much when I think I am sad
I love you so much
When I hate you so bad
'Cause I love you so much when I think I am sad
I hate you so bad when I love you
'Cause I know you love me too but we gotta leave
I love you so much when you're near
Yet I hate you so bad when you make love at me
I hate you so bad when you're "nule"
'Cause I know you wanna say things but you never do
I love you so much when you're inside me
Yet I hate you so bad when your eyes I can't see
You might also likeAah...
I love you so much
When I hate you bad
'Cause I love you so much when I think I am sad
I love you so much
When I hate you bad
'Cause I love you so much when I think I am sad
Uuuuuuuh...
I hate you so bad when I love you
'Cause I know you love me too but we gotta leave
I love you so much when you're near
Yet I hate you so bad when you make love at me
Aaah...
I hate you so bad when you're "nule"
'Cause I know you wanna say things but you never do
I love you so much when you're inside me
Yet I hate you so bad when your eyes I can't see
Don't know why I love you so much
'Cause I hate you so bad
When I think I love you in fact
Then I don't think that I really do
I don't know if I really do or do I
Oh my god, I think, I think
I love you
I do
I hate you
Or I love you...
Aaah...Embed
