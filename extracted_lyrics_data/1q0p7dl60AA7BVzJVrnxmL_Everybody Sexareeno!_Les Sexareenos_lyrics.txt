We've got something new
All for you
Wiggle and shake
Your legs will break
Roll around in the mud
There'll be no blood
Takin' out trash, gettin' that check
And it goes like this:
One! (One!)
Two! (Two!)
Three! (Three!)
Four! (Four!)
Stop, everybody Sexareeno!

And it goes like this:
One! (One!)
Two! (Two!)
Three! (Three!)
Four! (Four!)
Stop, take it away Troy!
