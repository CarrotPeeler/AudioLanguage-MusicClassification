Am I still awake?
Am I still awake?
Oh, mission desire
Am I still awake?
Am I still awake?
Hey, is there anything you want to know?
I don't think so
And I will seek you out from where you are
But slowly you recoil, unassuming
Then you are late
And you are late
Traffic sign
Leave me alone
Leave me alone
From this scene
Can't feel the weight of my arms when I'm close to you
Oh, mission desire
Am I still awake?
Am I still awake?
Oh, mission desire
Am I still awake?
Am I still awake?

Even sometimes when I sing, I'm not you, my true desire
But slowly you recoil, unassuming
That we are made
And we are made
It's a sign
Leave me alone
Leave me alone
From this scene
Can't feel the weight of my arms when I'm close to you
Can't feel the weight of my arms when I'm close to you
Oh, mission desire
Am I still awake?
Am I still awake?
Oh, mission desire
Am I still awake?
Am I still awake?
Oh, mission desire
Am I still awake?
Am I still awake?
Oh, mission desire
Am I still awake?
Am I still awake?Embed
