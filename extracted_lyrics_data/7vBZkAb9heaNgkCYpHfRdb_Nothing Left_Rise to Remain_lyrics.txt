3 ContributorsNothing Left Lyrics
Now, the departed are laid to rest
And the single chance to reconcile is covered with the earth
I heard her screaming, begging to the sky
All the while, the numbness culls all decency inside

I bid farewell to those forsaken eyes
But I would hold you when there's nothing left
I'll never let you down

So sick of trying all the time
The blood's been spilt, and it is mine
And all that's left to breathe
Are empty words inside my head

All the bullets shall unload
Empty casings, callous hold
The loss of one begins to burn
But I'll take that road when it's my turn

I bid farewell to those forsaken eyes
But I would hold you when there's nothing left
I'll never let you down!
You might also likeNo more will I fall apart...

I bid farewell to those forsaken eyes
But I would hold you when there's nothing left
I'll never let you down!Embed
