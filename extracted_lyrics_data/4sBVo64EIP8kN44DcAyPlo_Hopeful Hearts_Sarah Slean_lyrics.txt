Down into the fields of war
Sword alone, the shield foresaken
This the right we're fighting for
Hopeful hearts are moving targets
I don't know how I survive
We go out like birthday candles
Then like suns we rise, we rise...
O struggle is right
What's black is white
The moment you fall you fly
Give us your dead
They live again in
Our hopeful hearts
Fiends and devils in the garden
Take their fill and leave me scarred
But I still have me secret weapon
This my brave and hopeful heart
O struggle is right
What's black is white
The moment you fall you fly
Give us your dead
They live again in
Our hopeful heartsYou might also likeEmbed
