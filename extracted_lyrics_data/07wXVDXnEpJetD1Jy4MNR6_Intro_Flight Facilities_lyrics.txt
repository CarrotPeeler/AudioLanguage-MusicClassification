Welcome aboard, ladies and gentlemen
Today's flight will be a little over one hour
Just a few safety precautions before we head off:
We ask that you do move about the cabin as much as possible
Be sure to loosen those belts
And remember, all our flights are fitted with smoke detectors
So do try not to get caught
We'll be dimming the cabin lights for take-off
Thank you for choosing to fly with Flight FacilitiesYou might also likeEmbed
