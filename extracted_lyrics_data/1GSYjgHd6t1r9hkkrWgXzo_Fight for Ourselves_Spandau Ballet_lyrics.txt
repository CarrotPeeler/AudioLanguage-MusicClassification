7 ContributorsFight for Ourselves LyricsEverybody, we've got to fight for ourselves
Everybody, we've got to fight for ourselves
Everybody, we've got to fight for ourselves
Everybody, we've got to fight for ourselves
So many people, so many problems
There in the pretty city lights
Where we've thrown it all away
Well, if life is here before my eyes
Then I find it hard to see
How the methods that we've told to use
Are gonna make us free
Until then I say
Everybody, we've got to fight for ourselves
Everybody, we've got to fight for ourselves
All through the mystery
All through the heartache
She'v got the only single thing
That I'll never throw away
Oh, if lightning strikes for a second time
Will you come and pull me through'v
It's a battle that we all must make
So show me what to do
And you said
Everybody, we've got to fight for ourselves
Everybody, we've got to fight for ourselves
Well there's a feeling growing that is in this land
There's a soul that's burning and it's your hand
Everybody, we've got to fight for ourselves
Oh so many people now, there'v so many problems
There in the pretty city lights
Where we've thrown it all away
Well, if life is here before my eyes
Then I find it hard to see
How the methods that we've told to use
Are gonna make us free
Everybody, we've got to fight for ourselves
Everybody, we've got to fight for ourselves
Well there'v a feeling growing that is in this land
There's a soul that's burning and it's your hand
Everybody, we've got to fight for ourselvesYou might also likeEmbed
