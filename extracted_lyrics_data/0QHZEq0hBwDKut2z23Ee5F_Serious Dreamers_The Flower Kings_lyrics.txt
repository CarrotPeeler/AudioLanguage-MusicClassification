1 ContributorSerious Dreamers LyricsNow you tell me that you can't afford the dreaming
Serious dreamers always can afford the dreaming
Left at the roadside with this rapidly burning map
Like a magician with no rabbits in his hat
Line up the measures to fulfill your brother's dreams
Across the land we pay in sweat, keepin' up the steam
Now you tell me that you can't afford the dreaming
But I know it's just a lie
Serious dreamers always can afford the dreaming
And you know we're aiming high
Put on your makeup, now put on your dancing shoes
Into the wasteland, we've all seen you dancе away the blues
No time for introvеrsions, no more time to play
Serious distractions always seem to come your way
Now you tell me that you can't afford the dreaming
But I know it's just a lie
Serious dreamers always can afford the dreaming
And you know we're aiming high
From the nest we descend in a mist, all like birds on thin ice
From the kingdoms of childhood we dream on and turn to the wise
And the code that was written in blood and flesh in an ancient time
From the kingdom of Heaven the ships of dreams were sent to enlighten you
You might also likePlayground pirates gaze at the sun
Far out sisters and a flying nun
Poor Picasso gaze at the art
Ahead of time means a lonely heart
War is over, boys are home
Move into the friendly zone
Dream at diners, dying slowly
Where hungry hearts grows cold and lonely
From the nest we descend in a mist, all like birds on thin ice
From the kingdoms of childhood we dream on and turn to the wise
And the code that was written in blood and flesh in an ancient time
From the kingdom of Heaven the ships of dreams were sent to enlighten youEmbed
