Now, try as you might
Feel, out of the smoke
Running out of town
Ooh, baby forget
Running now, deep into it
Now, out in my house
And show you this town
Oh, heaven will know
Now she wants us bad
Girl, now there's confusion
Keep on walking back
Now she wants us bad
Oh, heaven might know
Girl, all this confusion
Heaven will knowYou might also likeEmbed
