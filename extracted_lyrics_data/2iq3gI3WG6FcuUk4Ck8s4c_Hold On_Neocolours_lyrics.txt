I can't deny it, now you are gone
This is the first time
Can I make it through?
Without you now, do the things I used to do
It's getting harder to ease the pain
The feeling changes, love still remains
I don't know how if I can get this right
Maybe given time
I'll make the most of what I've got
REFRAIN:
Is this the price we pay
With all the good times we shared
Faithfully, we've got a reason to go on
I know it's good to be true
Just spend the nights with you
Let me tell you that our love can make it through
CHORUS:
Hold on, baby hold on
We've got to go on now
This feeling so strong
Hold on, baby hold on
It's a burning desire
Comin' right down the wire
You might also likeSweet talking it's all in the line
There's no turning back
Unless you make up your mind
The expectations after all of these years
Risin' to the moment let's forget all our fears
REFRAIN:
Is this the love we have
With all the good times we shared
Faithfully, we've got a reason to go on
I know it's good to be true
Just spend the nights with you
Let me tell you that our love can make it through
CHORUS:
Hold on, baby hold on
We've got to go on now
This feeling so strong
Hold on, baby hold on
It's a burning desire
Comin' right down the wire
BRIDGE:
And when the night is over
Well, no one can deny it
Got to believe in
We couldn't ask for more
Than to hold each other tight
It's just we'll never take things for granted
CHORUS:
Hold on, baby hold on
We've got to go on now
This feeling so strong
Hold on, baby hold on
It's a burning desire
Comin' right down the wire
Hold on, baby hold on (hold on)
We've got to go on now
(You can hold on to me while I hold on to you...)
Hold on, baby hold on... (hold on)Embed
