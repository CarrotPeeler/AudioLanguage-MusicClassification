4 ContributorsRemind You Lyrics
Remember when I put you on (Yep)
Was super thirsty always on my phone (Yep)
And now you actin' like you got a girl goin' (Yep)
(Do you really think that you're that crazy) Oh yeah
Believin' the hype like you was a boss (Yep)
When it was thick, I held down the block (Yep)
Ain't never tripped off of nothin' you got (Yep)
(Was down for you 'cause I thought I was your baby) I thought I was your baby

You're out the hood, you're doin' well (Ooh)
You got a lil' paper trail (Uh-huh)
About your ends I never gave her
(And now you actin' like you're doin' me a favor)

Don't let me have to remind you
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
Don't let me have to remind you (Make me wanna say)
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh (Oh-oh)
Don't let me have to remind you
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh (Whoa-oh-oh)
Don't let me have to remind you
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
You might also like
Remember you was sleepin' on my mamma couch (Yep)
I had to beg her not to put your ass out (Yep)
And now you're tryna be slick up out the mouth
To take you back, you can't pay me
I'm the one who made you hot in the street
Who gave you your swagger (It was me)
Who taught you how to rock your fit (On the lean)
Was down for you 'cause I thought I was your baby

You're out the hood, you're doin' well (Oh)
You got a lil' paper trail (Mm-mm-mmm, yeah)
About your ends I never gave her (I never gave her)
(And now you actin' like you're doin' me a favor)

Don't let me have to remind you (Whoa)
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh (I didn't wanna have to tell ya)
Don't let me have to remind you
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh (Don't let me)
Don't let me have to remind you (Have you tell you 'bout yourself)
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh ('Cause I)
Don't let me have to remind you (Am holding you down for too long)
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh (For me to let you do me wrong, yeah)
Don't let me have to remind you
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
Don't let me have to remind you
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
Don't let me have to remind you
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
Don't let me have to remind you
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
Don't let me have to remind you
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
Don't let me have to remind you
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
Don't let me have to remind you
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
Don't let me have to remind you
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, ohEmbed
