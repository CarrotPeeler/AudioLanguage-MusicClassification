5 ContributorsUgly Day Lyrics
I don't know just how this happened
I didn't think it ever could
I'm the author of sappy love songs
Trading in my bachelorhood
Something snapped deep inside me
Something that somebody said
I felt the brush of angel's wings then
Your voice echoed in my head

Ugly Day, sun is shining
Every cloud's got a silver lining
Ugly day, the skies are blue
Now every day is ugly without you

You are the one pure thing
That I've always prayed for
Scales are falling from my eyes
I must have been so blind before
I would lie down on the street
To keep the dust off of your feet
I would kneel each time I kissed you
Anything, Christie I miss you
You might also like
Ugly Day, sun is shining
Every cloud's got a silver lining
Ugly day, the skies are blue
Now every day is ugly without you

Today was an ugly one
Just like all the others
All the flowers and the birds
Making me feel smothered
I would lie down on the street
To keep the dust off of your feet
I would kneel each time I kissed you
Anything, Christie I miss you

Ugly Day, sun is shining
Every cloud's got a silver lining
Ugly day, the skies are blue
Now every day is ugly without
Ugly Day, sun is shining
Every cloud's got a silver lining
Ugly day, the skies are blue
Now every day is ugly without youEmbed
