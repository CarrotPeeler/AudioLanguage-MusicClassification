Time flies
Time crawls
Like an insect
Up and down the walls

The light pours out of me
The light pours out of me

The conspiracy
Of silence ought
To revolutionise
My thought

The light pours out of me
The light pours out of me

The cold light of day
Pours out of me
Leaving me black
And so healthy
You might also like
The light pours out of me
The light pours out of me

It jerks out of me
Like blood
In this still life
Heart beats up love

The light pours out of me
The light pours out of me1Embed
