Quicksand, I'm in its grip
Quicksand, I'm in its grip
Sinking in the mud
Patron saint of the bog
They come with boots of blood
With pitchfork and with club
Chanting out my name
Got doggies straining on a chain
Lucy, I'll love you till the end!
They hunt me like a dog
Down in swampland!

So come, my executioners! Come, bounty hunters!
Come, my county killers, for I cannot run no more
I cannot run no more
I cannot run no more
No, I can't, no
Lucy, you won't see this face again
When you caught, you swing and burn
Down in swampland!

The trees are veiled in fog
The trees are veiled in fog
Like so many jilted brides
Now they're all breaking down and cry
Splashing tears upon my face
Splashing tears cold upon my face
And they smell of gasoline
Aaah, scream
Lucy, you made a sinner out of me
Now I'm burning like a saint
Down in swampland!
You might also like
So come my executioners! Come, my bounty hunters!
Come, my county killers, you know I cannot run no more
I cannot run no more, I cannot run no more, I cannot run no more
No, I cannot run no more
Down in swampland!Embed
