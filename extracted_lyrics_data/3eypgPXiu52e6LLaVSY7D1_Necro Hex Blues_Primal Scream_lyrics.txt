This whole leak was a pretext for an international police state
Arrest and prison without trial
This is the country of the blind
Arrest and prison without trial
This is the country of the blind

Shake this skin, the skin of evil
Stop projecting, start deflecting
Image blocker, death TV
We're amplified with cell resistance
Image blocker, death TV
We're amplified with cell resistance

Don't buy the gimmick, don't buy the gimmick
It'll make you sick, it'll make you sick
Sucker


Love your sister, love your brother
Pick one to keep the underdog under
Fight control with every breath
Seize the time like prophecies said
Fight control with every breath
Seize the time like prophecies said

Don't be a solider, don't take order
Don't give life, no sacrifice
Disobedience is a virtue
Blessed are those who struggle
Disobedience is a virtue
Blessed are those who struggle

Don't buy the gimmick, don't buy the gimmick
It'll make you sick, it'll make you sick
