2 ContributorsMust Be a Fool LyricsYou've been drinking and gambling
All night long
Sitting in my kitchen
Now your money's gone
Must be a fool
To give it all away
Must be a fool
Don't come knocking at my door
Must be a fool
You've been running and hiding
Keeping outta sight
Never pay your bills
Always causing a fight
Must be a fool
You'll end up in jail
Must be a fool
Don't come asking me to pay on your bail
Can't you see where it all goes wrong
Must be a fool
I heard your name on the radio
You've been in trouble again
I saw your face on the TV screen
Yes you're in trouble again
You might also likeBlue lights flashing
Outside your door
People saying
You don't live there no more
Must be a fool
To do what you do
There's a world of trouble
Just waiting on you
You get it wrong
You never get it right
Must be a fool
You get it wrong
You never get it right
Must be a foolEmbed
