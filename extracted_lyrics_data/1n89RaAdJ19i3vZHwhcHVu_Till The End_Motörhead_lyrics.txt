7 ContributorsTill the End Lyrics
Don't tell me what to do my friend
You'll break more hearts than you can mend
I know myself like no one else, nothing to defend
My life is full of good advice, and you don't have to tell me twice
Living here in Paradise, no rules that I should bend

In my years my life has changed, I can't turn back the time
I can't tell you just what made me change
All I know is who I am; I'll never let you down
The last one you can trust until the end

There ain't no rules to follow, you can't predict tomorrow
I know just who my friends are, the rest can turn to stone
Your memories are yours alone;
They're yours until your dust and bones
I know the things I'm looking for, I know just what I want

In my life the times have changed, I'm still the man I was
I don't want to hear your fairytale
All I know is who I am; I'll never let you down
The last one you can trust until the end, until the end
You might also likeGo!


In your life, you'll be amazed at all the love you lose
You can never live that life again
The one thing you will never lose is the singing in your head
That will still be with you until the endEmbed
