2 ContributorsI Do What I Want LyricsI'm a major minority, I can tell the government lies
Long as they don’t compromise my infernal disguise
Cold water is all around, is this what it feels like to drown
Ain't nobody to pull me out, it feels like I'm going down
White magic hypocrisy
Forced to follow the rules
And there ain't no places to fit us in
Cause it's been this way all along
I do what I want
Whenever I like
Because it's my right
I don’t ever want to do what I'm told
I'm getting old
And this is how my life’s been turning out
I do what I want
Whenever I like
Because it's my right
I don’t ever want to do what I'm told
I'm getting old
And this is how my life’s been turning out
I do what I want
Whenever I like
Because it's my right
I don’t ever want to do what I'm told
I'm getting old
And this is how my life’s been turning out
I do what I want
Whenever I like
Because it's my right
I don’t ever want to do what I'm told
I'm getting old
And this is how my life’s been turning out
For… me…You might also likeEmbed
