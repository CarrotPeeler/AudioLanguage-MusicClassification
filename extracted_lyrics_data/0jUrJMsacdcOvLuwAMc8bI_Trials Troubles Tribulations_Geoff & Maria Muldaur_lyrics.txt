1 ContributorTrials Troubles Tribulations Lyrics
Trials, troubles, tribulations
Such as never been before
When the angels pour upon us
Their vows of wrath forevermore

When the fires come down from Heaven
And the blood shall fill the sea
I'll be carried home by Jesus
And forever with him be

The mark must be upon your forehead
These earthly goods you then can buy
Depart from me I never knew you
I heard my blеssed savior cry

When the firеs come down from Heaven
And the blood shall fill the sea
I'll be carried home by Jesus
And forever with him be

When the fires come down from Heaven
And the blood shall fill the sea
I'll be carried home by Jesus
And forever with him be
You might also like
The beast with horns will come upon you
One with seven, one with ten
And we'll cry unto the mountains
We'll pray to God, but cannot win

When the fires come down from Heaven
And the blood shall fill the sea
I'll be carried home by Jesus
And forever with him beEmbed
