1 ContributorZorrillo LyricsDo you know me he said, as he threw a rock at my head
That was such a surprise, as I cut out his eyes
Do you know that I'm a freak? I eat donuts all week
Go on hit me again, I am king of pretend
So much prettier than me
You're so much prettier than me
The boys in the wood, jumped out Played Robin Hood
Do you want to come to my house? I'm as scared as a mouse
I've got shoulder long hair and holes everywhere
Please don't ask me to go, oh I guess I'll never know
So much prettier than me
Your so much prettier than me
So much Prettier than me
Your so much prettier
Do you know me he said, as he threw a rock at my head
Zorrillo
So much prettier than me
You're so much prettier than me
So much prettier than me
You're so much prettierYou might also likeEmbed
