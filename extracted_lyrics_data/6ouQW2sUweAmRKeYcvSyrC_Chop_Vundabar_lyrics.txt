I know
You've got me all pinned down
I know
You've really worked me out

Ooh wee-ooh ooh
Ooh, ooh ooh
Ooh wee-ooh ooh
Ooh, ooh

I will try to
Find a one to
Cut me up like you do
I do much

I lie
I do it all the time
I try
No wait or didn't I

Ooh wee-ooh ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh ooh
Ooh wee-ooh ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh ooh
You might also like
I will try to
Find a one to
Cut me up like you do
I do much

Ooh wee-ooh ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh ooh
Ooh wee-ooh ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh ooh7Embed
