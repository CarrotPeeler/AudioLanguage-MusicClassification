2 ContributorsLiving In Danger (D-House Mix) LyricsLive for yourself, it's a wonderful thing
You can do what you want
You can live in a dream
Get up, get in, get the rhythm, get down
You're living your life
In peace and in harmony
You're making your own decisions
That's how it's got to be for you and me
So many people are running 'round and 'round
Without any sense of logic
I see lies, in the eyes of a stranger
Woah, you'll be living in danger
I see lies, in the eyes of a stranger
Woah, you'll be living in danger
I see lies, in the eyes of a stranger
Woah, you'll be living in danger
People are the same today
As they used to be
The same expectations
So high no one can reach that high
Not I nor you get satisfied today
We'll never get enough
I see lies, in the eyes of a stranger
Woah, you'll be living in danger
I see lies, in the eyes of a stranger
Woah, you'll be living in danger
I see lies, in the eyes of a stranger
Woah, you'll be living in danger
I see lies, in the eyes of a stranger
Woah, you'll be living in danger
People are the same today
As they used to be
We'll never get enough
I see lies, in the eyes of a stranger
Woah, you'll be living in danger
I see lies, in the eyes of a stranger
Woah, you'll be living in danger
I see lies, in the eyes of a stranger
Woah, you'll be living in danger
I see lies, in the eyes of a stranger
Woah, you'll be living in danger
Live for yourself, it's a wonderful thing
You can do what you want
You can live in a dream
Get up, get in, get the rhythm, get down
Keep moving your feet
 time
Everybody's moving and  line
Get up, get in, get the rhythm, get down
In the eyes of a stranger
Woah, you'll be living in danger
I see lies, in the eyes of a stranger
Woah, you'll be living in danger
In the eyes of a stranger
Woah, you'll be living in danger
I see lies, in the eyes of a stranger
Woah, you'll be living in dangerYou might also likeEmbed
