Jason, ha-ha-ha
Jason Derulo
Ha-ha-ha
Get Jazzy on 'em

I'm that flight that you get on, international
First-class seat on my lap, girl, ridin' comfortable (Oh, yeah), ha
'Cause I know what da girl dem need, New York to Haiti
I got lipstick stamps on my passport, you make it hard to leave

Been around the world, don't speak the language (Uh-huh)
But your booty don't need explainin' (Uh-huh)
All I really need to understand is (Uh-huh) when you

Talk dirty to me
Talk dirty to me (What?)
Talk dirty to me
Talk dirty to me (What?)
Get Jazzy on 'em

You know the words to my songs, no habla inglés (Oh)
Our conversations ain't long, but you know what is
I know what the girl dem want, London to Taiwan
I got lipstick stamps on my passport, I think I need a new one
See Jason Derulo LiveGet tickets as low as $64You might also like
Been around the world, don't speak the language (Uh-huh)
But your booty don't need explainin' (Oh, uh-huh)
All I really need to understand is (Uh-huh) when you

Talk dirty to me (Woo)
Talk dirty to me (Haha, what?)
Talk dirty to me (Talk, yeah)

Dos Cadenas, close to genius
Sold-out arenas, you can suck my penis (Ooh, damn)
Gilbert Arenas, guns on deck (Deck)
Chest to chest, tongue on neck (Neck)
International oral sex
Every picture I take, I pose a threat (Yeah, oh)
Bought a jet, what'd you expect?
Her pussy's so good, I bought her a pet (Oh, oh, oh, oh)
Anyway, every day, I'm tryna get to it
Got her saved in my phone under "Big Booty" (Haha)
Anyway, every day, I'm tryna get to it
Got her saved in my phone under "Big Booty"
Been around the world, don't speak the language (Uh-huh)
But your booty don't need explainin' (Uh-huh)
All I really need to understand is (Uh-huh) when you

Talk dirty to me (You do)
