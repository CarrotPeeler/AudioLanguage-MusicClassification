1 ContributorTrust in me LyricsTrust in me, just in me
Close your eyes, trust in me
You can sleep all safe and sound
Knowing I am around
Enter a silent slumber
Sail on a silver mist
Slowly but surely
Your senses will cease to resist
Trust in me, oh just in me
Close your eyes and trust in me
'Cause you can sleep all safe and sound
Knowing I am around
Close your eyes and trust in meYou might also likeEmbed
