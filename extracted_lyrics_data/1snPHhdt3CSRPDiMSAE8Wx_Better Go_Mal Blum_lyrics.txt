12 ContributorsBetter Go! Lyrics
Drunk dial, then I wish that you would
It's such a pretty house in a pretty yard in a pretty neighborhood
Goddammit, I wish that it were
A metaphor for a feeling or the hard cover of your new memoir, oh

Oh my god, look at all the stuff you've got
Does it make your loneliness more bearable?
You look a lot like me, but
Remiss the oft anxiety
Sated, and I wish that I was

Better go, better go, better go without me
'Cause I don't, I don't, I don't know the thing to say
It's all demand 'till they need where your body stands
Guess I ain't using my body anyway
Guess I ain't using my body anyway

Anyway
So tired and I wish that I was
Anyone in another state in another place in another neighborhood
Goddammit, who's taking you home?
Goddammit, I wish that I could
No no, no
You might also like
Oh my god, you got everything you wanted
Even a bloodless diamond rock, who would have thought?
You look a lot like you
But maybe I also do, and
If the house is glass, then I am not
Why

Better go, better go, better go without me
'Cause I don't, I don't, I don't know the thing to say
It's all demand 'till they need where your body stands
Guess I ain't using my body anyway
Guess I ain't using my body anyway

Anyway
One by fire and one by plague
Don't think that I'll see you again
But I don't mind it as I once did
I push the door 'cause it opens in
All my tension taut and inhabited, yes

Oh my god, another brownstone city block
"Pull out the playground, build a lot if they're smart"
You say 'cause you've got to live
And I cared, and you never did
Hope your computer keeps you warm where I could not
Hope your computer keeps you warm where I could not
Better go, better go, better go without me
'Cause I don't, I don't, I don't know the thing to say
It's all demand 'till they need where your body stands
Guess I ain't using my body anyway
Guess I ain't using my body anyway1Embed
