6 ContributorsWashington Square Lyrics
(It's better to have loved and lost than never loved at all)
(Just love the lust, you'll have the leap without the fall)
(It's better to have loved and lost than never loved at all)
(Just love the lust, you'll have the leap without the fall)

Your best friend asked if I am straight or gay
I can understand the question when I dance this way
Straight I said, he said that's okay
Some other little something might be coming your way
A little while later and up you slide
Sipping on your drink, I'm making moves on the side
I've got to impress her with my mating routine
Show her something no New Yorker will have ever seen
So I pull out the peacock knees of surprise
She laughs and tells me that I sprayed sweat in her eyes
I apologise, stand still on the spot
She puts her hand on my back and says, "Wow, you're hot"

You turn me on
You turn me on
You turn me on
You turn me on
You turn me on
You turn me on
You turn me on
You turn me on
You turn me on
You turn me on
You turn me on
You might also like
It's as clear as the ice melting in my glass
There was no need for questions to be asked
Hear the how d'you dos, why d'you dos, political views, you've heard the news
The, "Oh, my God it's different here, you have to tip with every beer"
It's clear, so little time to waste
Make the move, haste posthaste
This is lust at first sight
Let's knock at the night 'til it retreats to light

I'm in New York making out in the back of a cab
And she's giving me her body to taste, touch, and grab
I'm fulfilling a cliché, ticking a box
Big Apple, yellow cab and an American fox
The city gliding past us block by block
I never ever ever want this cliché to stop

Knowing that skyscrapers rise above
I could have sworn I felt a crazy little surge of love
The love of lust, directed at you
Do you feel the same way too?
Please tell me that you do
And we can love lust the whole night through
They say it's better to have loved and lost than never loved at all
Just love the lust, you'll have the leap without the fall
They say it's better to have loved and lost than never loved at all
Just love the lust, you'll have the leap without the fall
They say it's better to have loved and lost than never loved at all
Just love the lust, you'll have the leap without the fall
They say it's better to have loved and lost than never loved at all
Just love the lust, you'll have the leap without the fall

You turn me on
You turn me on
You turn me on
You turn me on
You turn me on
You turn me on
You turn me on
You turn me on
You turn me on
You turn me on
You turn me onEmbed
