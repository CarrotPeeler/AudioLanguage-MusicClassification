5 ContributorsGet Down (Acoustic) Lyrics
Outside there's a bird and it is singing
And outside of my window, there's a life
I feel like someone's talking to my spirit
They tell me that there's reasons to survive

I could draw you a picture
I could write all my fears
I could read you a scripture of tears

But I know, no matter how much colder
Or how much I carry on my shoulders
As long as I'm standing, I'll be closer
'Cause it ain't over, 'til it's over
No, we don't get down, no
No, we don't get down, no, no, no
We can turn this 'round
And maybe
It's today ahh yeah

And all these scenes of grief got my head spinnin'
And we're dancing on the edge of a knife
And could I be your hero or your villain
Yeah, I guess it just depends in whose eyes

I could draw you a picture
I could write all my fears
I could read you a scripture of tears

But I know, no matter how much colder
Or how much I carry on my shoulders
As long as I'm standing, I'll be closer
'Cause it ain't over, 'til it's over
No, we don't get down, oh
No, we don't get down, no, no, no
We can turn this 'round
And maybe
It's today

No, I don't get down, 'cause you lift me up
No, I don't get down, 'cause you lift me up
No, I don't get down, 'cause you lift me up
No, I don't get down, 'cause you lift me up
No, I don't get down, 'cause you lift me up
No, I don't get down, 'cause you lift me up
I don't get down, 'cause you lift me up
No, I don't get down, 'cause you lift me up
And I know, no matter how much colder
Or how much I carry on my shoulders
As long as I'm standing, I'll be closer
'Cause it ain't over, 'til it's over
No, we don't get down
No, we don't, no, we don'tEmbed
