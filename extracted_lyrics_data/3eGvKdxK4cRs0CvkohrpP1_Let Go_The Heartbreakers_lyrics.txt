...3, 4!
1, 2, 3, 4!

Oh, every place I go, I see your face in the crowd
In the parking lot or in the lounge
Or standing on the corner with the rest of the kids
I say, "What is it, baby?
What is it?"

Let go!
Let go!
Let go!
I don't know why you just don't... blow!

Oh, what is it, baby, that drives you wild?
Radar love 'cause you're always around
Following me, never saying a word
Looking hypnotically insane

Let go!
Let go!
Let go!
I don't know why you just don't...
You might also like
I don't know why you just don't... blow!

Oh, every place I go, I see your face in the crowd
In the parking lot or in the lounge
Or standing on the corner with the rest of the kids
I say, "What is it, baby?
What is it?"

Let go!
Let go!
Let go! (Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, baby, let go!)
Let go!
Let go! (Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, honey, let go!)
I don't know why you just don't...
Let go!
Let go!
Let go!
Let go!
Let go!
I don't know why you just don't...
Let go!Embed
