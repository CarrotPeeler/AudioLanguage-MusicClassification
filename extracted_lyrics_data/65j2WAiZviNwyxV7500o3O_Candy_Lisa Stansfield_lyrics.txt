3 ContributorsCandy LyricsYou open your eyes and I see sunshine
I bathe in the light that you give me
You speak my name it's a symphony
And the magic of life rushes through me
Suggest it and I'll do it
There ain't nothing to it
'Cos it feels so good for me
It's wickedly delicious
I've got my three wishes
And baby when you want me
It's like taking candy from a baby
And it's sweeter than sweet
When you're right here with me
It's like taking candy from a baby
'Cos you do it to me every time
Yes you do
You do it to me every time
I dream of that place and you take me there
Boy, this is love and you're writing the story
When you run your fingers through my hair
Feels like the whole world is turning just for me
I never have to wait
'Cos you reciprocate
Everything I do, yeah
It's wickedly delicious
I've got my three wishes
It almost seems too easy

When you're right here with me
It's like taking candy from a baby
'Cos you do it to me every time
Yes you do
You do it to me every time
It's like taking candy from a baby
And it's sweeter than sweet
When you're right here with me

'Cos you do it to me every time
Sweeter than sweet

And it's sweeter than sweet
When you're right here with me
