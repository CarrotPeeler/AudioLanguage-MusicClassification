1 ContributorHell Inside My Head LyricsHell inside my head...
I'm on the run, into the new arms someplace
Run... I'm on the run, inside my head
Running some lovin' madness
Destiny has put me to the test
Like Kerosene, I'm setting fire to the blackness!
I'm on my way, until your bleedin', makin' you screamin'
I'm out of day, I'm realizing, this is my time of rising!
Why? Why me not him, I can't get out
I am a slave to your system
Lives... I'm out of lives, wasting my time, taking back all I can babe
Can't you see, she's hard to possess
Hard to please, she's a disappearing mistress
I'm on my way, until your bleedin', makin' you screamin'
I'm out of day, I'm realizing, this is my time of rising!
Call me...
When you need a hustle break
Don't make me...
Tell you why I can't escape
Love is just a dream!
I'm on my way, until your bleedin', makin' you screamin'
I'm out of day, I'm realizin', this is my time of rising

I'm out of day, until it's over, I seem to be getting closer!Embed
