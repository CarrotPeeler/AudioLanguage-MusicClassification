1 ContributorDeer LyricsIs it crime?
Is it crime?
What was stolen wasn't mine
Call me dear
Call me your dear
But darling it isn't clear
If I'm the one in the headlights
Or on the side of the road
The one in the headlights
Or on the side of the road
I'm afraid you'll choose
Is it fall?
Is it fall?
We unravelled like a psalm
Call me dear
Call me your dear
But darling it isn't clear
If I'm the one in the headlights
Or on the side of the road
The one in the head lights
Or on the side of the road
I'm afraid you
I'm afraid you'll choose
I'm afraid you
I'm afraid you'll choose

Or on the side of the road?
The one in the headlights?
Or on the side of the road
Or on the side of the road
Or on the side of the roadEmbed
