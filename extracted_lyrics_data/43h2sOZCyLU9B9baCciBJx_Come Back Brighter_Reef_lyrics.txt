Sun hurts me, if I try to fight her
I won't be sat here waiting
I won't be sat here waiting
I won't be sat here waiting for it
So come and take me on
Sometimes, the black hole's inside ya
But if you can just lighten up yourself
It will make you stronger
I won't be sat here waiting
I won't be sat here waiting
I won't be sat here waiting for it
So come and take me on
Get up, get up, get up, get up...
C'mon, been down, but I've come back brighter
Sun hurts me, if I try to fight her
I won't be sat here waiting
I won't be sat here waiting
I won't be sat here waiting
For you, so come and take me
So come and take me on and on and on...
Get up, get up, get up, get up...
