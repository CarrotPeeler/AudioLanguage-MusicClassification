1 ContributorSplash LyricsSplash was the day
That you got in my system
Soul was the way
It's a basic fascination
Desire is to move
Between your thighs and this song
I said blind is the fool
That's keeping me from kissing you wrong
I play what you know
You say what I see
Liquid love is a wonderful thing
When you rain
Liquid love is a wonderful thing
When you rain
If we were born today
There'd been no need to hide
Because naked is the way
The way we lie the way we die
If we were born today
There'd been no need to hide
Because naked is the way
The way we lie the way we die
Splash was the game
Between my colourful brothers and sisters
Religious rules in the way
Colonised their imaginations

When you rain
Liquid love is a wonderful thing
When you rainEmbed
