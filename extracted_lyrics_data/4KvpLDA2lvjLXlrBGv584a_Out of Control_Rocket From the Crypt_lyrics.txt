1 ContributorOut of Control LyricsI'm a burning village
I can't control myself
Like a free bird floating
I'm never askin' for help
My purple robes disgrace
Drawn into their black embrace
Go more places, make more lies
Hiding secrets under rocks, my hell
It's mighty low
I'm out of control
Eternal 24's all i've sold it's my hell
It's mighty low
I'm out of control
Eternal 24's all i've sold
Writin' a witch
Up in my will
I've got no defense
Against myself
My fingers crossed already
That's not bull that's on the way
Hog me in and wash me up
I'm beggin' first god save me please from hell
It's mighty low
I'm out of control
Eternal 24's all i've sold it's my hell
It's mighty low
I'm out of control
Eternal 24's all i've soldYou might also likeEmbed
