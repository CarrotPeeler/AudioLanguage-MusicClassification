4 Contributors8th Commandment Lyrics
All those lies suit you
They are custom made to
Drive you out of reality
Lies are true for you
You know, what you do is
Reaching a point of insanity

When you wake from your dream you know what is true?
Ring of bell inside your head is playing with your mind

Remember to pray
And what the Bible says
And you will live through eternity
You haven't heard of this?
There is something you missed
It will cost you so heavily

You must sleep in the stinking bed that you have made
When you're down where you belong hear what they say

Stay for a while, stay forever
Sing for the times you are bound to betray
Run for your life, run forever
Your eyes tell a lie and the liar must always die

When you're done with him
You know where you have been
He will treat us all equally
Can you feel the fire burning

You must sleep in the stinking bed that you have made
When you're down where you belong hear what they say

Stay for a while, stay forever
Sing for the times you are bound to betray
Run for your life, run forever
Your eyes tell a lie and the liar must always die

Stay for a while, stay forever
Sing for the times you are bound to betray
Run for your life, run forever
Your eyes tell a lie and the liar must always dieEmbed
