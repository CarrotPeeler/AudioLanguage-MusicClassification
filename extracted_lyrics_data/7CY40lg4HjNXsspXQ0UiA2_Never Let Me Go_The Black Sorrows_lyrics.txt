2 ContributorsNever Let Me Go LyricsAh-hah-hah (ooh-hooh, ooh-hooh)
Ah-hah, ah-ah-hah-ah (ooh-hooh, ooh-hooh)
Ah-hah
Don't need another weight around my neck
No I don't want no two-timin' nervous wreck
No rich boy to drive my car
Get a message baby, now you stay where you are
You'll hear that wheeler rollin' down the track
Ain't no use in you just turnin' your back
The wind's rockin' the cradle above
This ain't the season or the summer of love
Now if you think you've got it together
There's one thing that you oughta know
You'll never let me go (don't let me go)
Don't need another love to tie me down
Don't want no whispers 'bout you leavin' this town
You might be ready for the show to begin
I ain't got time for any innocent thing, uh-uh, uh-uh
Now if you think you've got it together
Know that there's one thing that you should know
You'll never let me go (don't let me go)
You'll never let me go (don't let me go)
I said you'll never let me go (don't let me go)
No, no, you'll never let me go (don't let me go)
Oh, you make me love you so

Don't need another weight around my neck
No I don't want no two-timin' nervous wreck
No rich boy, to drive my car
Get a message baby, now you stay where you are
You'll hear that wheeler come rollin' on down the track
No there ain't no use in you just turnin' your back
And it's rockin' the cradle above
This ain't the season or the summer of love
Now if you think you've got it together
Know that there's one thing that you should know
You'll never let me go (don't let me go)
You'll never let me go (don't let me go)Embed
