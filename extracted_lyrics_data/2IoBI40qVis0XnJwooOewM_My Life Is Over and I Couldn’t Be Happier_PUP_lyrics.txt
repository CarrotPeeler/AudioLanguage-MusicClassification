11 ContributorsMy Life Is Over and I Couldnâ€™t Be Happier Lyrics
I don't even know why you're so pissed
You said I'm such a piece of shit
That wasn't subtle at all
Maybe I deserve more credit than you gave me
You say I'll never learn and it's never gonna phase me
It doesn't phase me at all

If I came home right now
What would I find out?

I'm at the end of my tether
You're under my skin, and I'm lettin' it fester
Yeah, I've had enough
Stumble out, and I'm headed for the van
I can't drive, man, I can barely stand
Forget getting it up

I bet you faked it all along
And I bet you never missed me at all
I'm still waiting, I'm not movin' on

If I came home right now
What would I find out?

You won't believe me
You won't believe me
You won't believe me
You won't believe me
You won't believe me
You won't believe me1Embed
