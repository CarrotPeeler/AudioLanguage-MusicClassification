Keep your ears to the ground
Rest your mind, pick up the guitar
(I'm gonna be a fucking superstar)
Keep your visions, give us the sound
Keep your ears to the ground
Rest your mind, pick up the guitar
Keep your visions, give us the sound
Keep your ears to the ground
Rest your mind, pick up the guitar
(I'm gonna be a fucking superstar)
Well, it's not too much to ask of you, baby
It's not too much to ask
It's not too much to ask of you, baby
To come around, come around, come around, come around
Just leave this place
Come towards the light
Just leave this place
We are going to drift away
Keep your visions, give us the sound
Keep your ears to the ground
Rest your mind, pick up the guitar

Not too much to ask of you, baby
It's not too much to ask
It's not too much to ask of you, baby
To come around, come around, come around, come around
Just leave this place
Come towards the light

Well, every day, you come and say it's alright
You come say it, say that it's alright
They're telling me that you can't breathe the air
And they save you, but this will make it right
Keep your visions, give us the sound
Keep your ears to the ground
Rest your mind, pick up the guitar
Keep your visions, give us the sound
Keep your ears to the ground
Rest your mind, pick up the guitarEmbed
