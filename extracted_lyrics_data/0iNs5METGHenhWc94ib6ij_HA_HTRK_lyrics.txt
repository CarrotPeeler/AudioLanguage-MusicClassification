3 ContributorsHA LyricsCan I be out of line?
Can we get back together?
You drink, I'll pour the wine
Can we get back together?
Your girlfriend's prettier than mine
Can we get back together?
I'll have you home by nine or whatever
Can we get back together?
Ha ha ha ha ha
Ha ha ha ha
Can I be out of line?
Can we get back together?
You drink I'll pour the wine
Can we get back together?
Your girlfriend's prettier than mine
Can we get back together?
It's close, just not mine
Can we get back together?
Ha ha ha ha
Ha ha ha ha
Ha ha ha ha ha ha

Can we get back together?
Your girlfriend's prettier than mine
Can we get back together?
I'll have you home by nine or whatever
Can we get back together?
Ha ha ha ha
Ha ha ha ha
If you stay
I'll make you a starEmbed
