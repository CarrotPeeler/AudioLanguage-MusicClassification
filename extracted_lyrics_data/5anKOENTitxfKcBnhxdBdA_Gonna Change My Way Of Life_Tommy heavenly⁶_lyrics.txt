3 ContributorsTOON WORLD Lyrics
It's time to d-d-d-d-d-d-d-duel
You’re Brandon
But since we're friends
I can call you Xelishurt
Ha-ha, yeah, yeah (Ayy, yuh)
Yeah, huh, yea-yeah
I’m hittin’, keepin’ the puck, puck (Yeah, yeah)
You can never—(Ba-ba-ba-ba)
Ayy, ayy, yeah

Stupid ass nigga, you failin' the mission
Clutch on that gatling, I'll shoot like I'm Pippin (Uh)
Crankin' this metal, man just like a piston
Bitch, you a puppy, you eat where you shittin' (Yeah)
Keepin' that blade on me, just like I'm Meta Knight
She know I'm there tonight, yeah
Running this blade in your body, you stuck up
I could give zero, nigga, just like a fuck-fuck
Rollin’ the dice, hit a six and your luck up
Dagger thе dick to your tummy like a tuck-tuck (Urgh)
Ending you niggas like beef, you a chuck chuck
Hit with the stick likе it's hockey, yeah, puck-puck (Uh-ugh)
Feel like I'm Yugi, I'll summon a skull in this bitch
Nigga's a drag, I'm on Asuma shit (Yeah)
Pullin' the trigger, see smoke like a cig'
Bitch, I'm the leader, no votes in this bitch
Bitches gon’ do what I say
You in my way? I'ma go cut like my blade (Uh)
Smokin' this gas and my eyes turning red like a dragon
I'm getting high like Aladdin
Yeah, running this bitch like I'm John fuckin’ Madden
Yeah, nigga's not friends, I'm sorry you saddened (Ayy, yeah)
Yeah, hop out the water man just like a kraken (Ayy, yeah)
Yeah, I brought a katana, just stay where I'm stabbing (Ayy, yeah)
Bat gonna bang on his head like the drum of this beat
Yeah, pussy gon’ fall to his feet (Yeah)
She climb on my dick, that's a mountainous feat
Yeah, the AK gon’ knock on his door, trick-or-treat
Yeah, that pussy ass boy gonna hide while I seek (Yeah)
And that Glocky gonna burn on that nigga like bleach (Ugh)
When you gonna learn? Shut your mouth when I speak
Yeah, I'm still on my climb, while you hittin’ your peak
Yeah, I'm hittin’ that bitch with the wood like a Dodger
She call me father, yeah, do what I do, then I block her (Ugh)
My shotty drop shells like a lobster, you gon’ get put in a rocker
Yeah, I post on the block with the gang like a mobster (Yeah)
Yeah, I'm spinnin’ that shit like a chopper (Yeah)
Send him to hell like a copter, ugh
N-N-N-Nigga get folded like paper
Never knew homies would become my traitors
Yeah, she twirl and dance on my dick like a skater (Ugh)
Problem is I know that I could never date her
Snap on the track with my jaw, like a gator (Ayy, yeah)
Bitches gonna suck me up until it gets wet like a squeegee
Summon the demon, man just like it's Ouija
Yeah, countin’ my green in the mansion, Luigi
Pegasus shit with my eye, you can't see me (Ayy, ayy)
Yeah, smokin’ your pack and it stink like a skunk
Yeah, I don't give a fuck, you get stuffed in the trunk
Man, I thought that I told you that you fake like a punk
All of you niggas just suck, I'm holding my shotty, a pump
I'm pullin' it back then it thump, he put in the bed like a punk
All of your music just sucks, you stuck on that phonk shit
You pussies get stuffed in the trunk
You might also like
What are you doing Prompto?
Ayy, playing these rappers like cards in the field
Summon my enemies, bid to my will
Heart of the cards, yeah my bond made of steel (Yeah)
Blue eyes like Kaiba, I came here to kill
No way you could fuck up my day, that's dangerous
Braise overcooked, 'cause I flip you like Angus
Trap activated, got you feeling so anxious
Heat it up, mm, goddamn, so savorous
Voice is the remedy, crib with amenities
Got drip, oh man, damn, it's the seventies (Damn)
Servin' these hoes my flows, like the seven seas
Sold my soul, shadow realm, it's a penalty
Pegasus, uh, I fly so heavenly (Uh)
Genesis impact, with the rage in fact
To the stage take laps, hit you with a pay back (Ayy, ayy) (Yeah, yeah)
Crossed up, must've thought that it's a parallax (Ayy, ayy)
Cards up in my deck, must've thought it was a Toon World
Way I play my set, make you drown into the underworld
Got ammunition, I came here to stay (To stay)
Try to control me and take me away
No kidding, I tremble at thoughts of mistakes (Mistakes)
But me and this rap shit are changing the ways (Yeah)
No gates, that I can't break through
No state that I fake my self hate, can't relate (Ayy, ayy)
These chains that I maintain, bound my place (Ayy, ayy)
Fuck fate, I'ma penetrate and sedate my (Ayy, ayy)
Future with a full force change, I can manifest
True to what I say, out my way, I'ma make a mess
Focus on the life that I gained, I got no regrets
Toon World, flip the page, end of days, and I'm going nextEmbed
