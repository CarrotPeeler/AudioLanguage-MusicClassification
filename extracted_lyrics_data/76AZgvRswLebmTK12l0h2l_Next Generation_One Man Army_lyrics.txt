1 ContributorNext Generation Lyrics
Out on the streets, out in the cold
No one cares and nobody knows
The night is young, it belongs to us
As the city sleeps, that's when we're feelin' alright

Next generation
Oh-hoah

Come out to the corners, all you boys and girls
There's a brand new sound on the airwaves
Ringing out loud all across the way
From the city downtown to the golden gate
It don't matter where you're comin' from
As long as you're here you'll be a part of this song
The night is young, yeah, it belongs to us
As the city sleeps I know you're feelin' alright

Alright
Everybody's ours tonight
When tomorrow comes
We'll tear down the wall
Until it all comes down, down, down
It doesn't matter where you're comin' from
The next generation
