2 ContributorsWide Awake LyricsI am so wide awake
So wired and I don't like this state
I'm seein' into spots
That narrow into places inside
I fought for what I got
And when I sleep, the dust remains
I won't go when you go
And where it takes you, no one knows
Oh now and you come round and you often do
We go lookin' for illusions, anything at all, anything at all
All the spaces that we cover and we often do
And do ? going back to where, where we started from
All these spaces that we cover and we often do
And do ? going back to where, where we started from
The spaces on the trail
I'm tryin' to hear what you say
The spaces on the wall
I'm tryin' to see what you see
I fought for what I got
And when I sleep, the dust remains
Don't know when you go
And where it takes you, no one knows
You might also likeAll of the ?? and you often do
And go looking for illusions, anything at all, anything at all
All these spaces that we cover and we often do
And do ? going back to where, where we started from
All these spaces that we cover and we often do
And do ? going back to where, where we started from
Oh I got this feeling that we're going in circles too
Going back around and I don't know what to do
