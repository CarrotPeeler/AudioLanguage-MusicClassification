2 ContributorsBad Man Lyrics
Time was in a vacuum when I wanted to be free
Yeah, yeah, but now my adolescence has all but left me
I couldn't stay another day—It would be wrong
And you would just grow tired of me before too long

I said no, I must go
I'm not the one you want, though I know you think so

I'm a bad man, I'm a bad man!
I'm a bad man!
But I'm too good for you
My Susie true
All right

Time was so much special and that is just for me
You can tell—the sound of my shoes—baby, I am gonna leave
Even if you plead to me and say you were so true
It's too late for long goodbyes, oh, we are through

I said no, I must go
I'm not the one you want, though you think so
You might also like
I'm a bad man, I'm a bad man!
I'm a bad man!
But I'm too good for you
My Susie true

Whoo-hoo
Whoo-hoo-oo
Whoo-hoo-oo
Oo-hooEmbed
