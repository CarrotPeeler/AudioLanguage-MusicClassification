7 ContributorsHouse of Glass Lyrics
We were glasshouse girls
In our plastic wigs and furs
In a crazy house
From within and from without
You could see right through
See the things that people do
There is no place to hide
When you're lit from the inside
Overblown
People like us
From broken homes
Never throw stones
Leave us alone

We were glasshouse girls
Full of joie de vivre and verve
Built a house of glass
Out of fragments from the blast
When it's all revealed
Must be seen to be believed
Little raincoat sister
When allowed to dream
Made a new reality

No

Every glasshouse girl
Keeps a secret from the world
What you think you see
A naive transparency?
On a stage of glass
How long can the play last?
You see, every glasshouse child
Has a troubling side
Overblown
Little pieces of a broken dream
Scattered in a million different places
People who live in glass (houses)
People who live in glass (houses)
No
Overblown
What you think you see?
A naive transparency?
On a stage of glass
How long can the play last?1Embed
