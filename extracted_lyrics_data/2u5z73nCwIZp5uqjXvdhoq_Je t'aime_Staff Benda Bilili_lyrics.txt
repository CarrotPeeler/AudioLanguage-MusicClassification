1 ContributorBread Bag Lyrics
404, 401 code word
404, 401 code word code word for s*** is
(Dope7 Gang stuff stuffing n***as)
For da gang stuff (Gang signs)
Double numbers (clone)
Throw fire at the Grammys

Why would I go this way if there was another thing to work with?
On my Mara s***, oh well, All fair f**king love & war n***as true n***as
So immature like I'm a little boy, filled the tab with a bag of Audemars
Mark your phone down
I wanna f**k you in a different area
Fill the bread bag
Oh, oh
This just be a stunt, acceptance gonna be an emotional this I earned
Alright, learn s***, I'll die alone covered in dirt, that was pretty deservеd
You got locked up over a f**ked up gunshot crimеs were served
Went from Gang streets saw Barrivillians ride the streets, was reserved
Get your bag fill it with the racks
Pound that booty my d**k feel so fruity fill the sack
Bring your s*** back diamond back
Fireback wit fireballs fill my ice with the racks
Keep my sex symbols, love those dimples
P**ps love me cause I'm charismatic
(Earn a million for a n***a)
Earn a billion for my h*es nutty buddy n***as
Made a new version but this was avoided buddy
Nerds be smokin in Turks twerkin in Turks
Owned the whole city rented out a whole area cause the b**ches owned all the land
X*ns, big tans, bigger the tans, taking the x*ns, eat the cocktails, gimme your hand
Dial your number, dope dialer, dope dial up, dial up, I got fans in Dans
Banville h*es, but no one knows, I'm in the know, i'm in a big show
F**k a opp, pull up a opp, black opps, real opps, deal opps, f**k opps
Pull up a n***a but your middle finger down, snitches they be on top
F**k that, realer on that dealer
St-st-st-st-stutterin sounds like i'm mutterin, he owns none of this
Bend over backwards, come over wit that miss, shut that s*** down
Wrote bars bout 7 days ago, beat your a*s give you a frown, pound it like a bloodhound
Come over like how I crammed it into over an hour hit sneak diss on a n***a
Toured around the world, practiced my accent, p*ss on a trigger
Dope n***as, new run but it wasn't too long since I friended a fiend

Done my rock s***, set my riff my love (love, bread bags, bread bags)
Stop docking the plane, the plane is on fire (fireworks, fireworks)
Sounding good piggy you were so conceited (done your deeds)
I know how to stand on my toes eat this s*** up, you exposed your lies
Ghetto s*** pushed me over in the lover level, cause of the devil
Went outdoors to the farmers they know shooters (Glock, Glock)
Munch on da entrepreneurs I have no ho in my life (life up b**ch)
Wriss up my watch (yeah) cashapp me (cashapp me, cashapp me, cashapp me)
Put those footprints on the map (on the tracks) need a new b**ch to put on the map
Need a new one, need a new one
Put it all s*** in a bread bag
