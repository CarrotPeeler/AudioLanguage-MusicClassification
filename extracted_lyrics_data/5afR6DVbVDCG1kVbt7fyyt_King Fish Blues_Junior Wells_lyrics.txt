King fish in the deep blue sea
Little minnows in the river
King fish in the deep blue sea
Lord I got to gang a woman
Try'in to get a chance with me
You may think it's all right
But baby dall, can't you see
You may think it's all right
But baby dall, can't you see
Now you know dawn well
You're getting lot of places with me
(You can do it Big Joe)
I will play king fish babe
I will just act like the loners do
I will play the king fish baby
Will just act like the loners do
In case I just flood out
Don't feel ashamed with you
You might also likeI'm a king fish papa
And I know which bait to choose
I'm a king fish papa
And I know what kind of bait to choose
That's why so many women is cry'in
The old Lord King Fish BluesEmbed
