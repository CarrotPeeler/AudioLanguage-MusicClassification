The perfume of twilight, her strongest scent
Half wolf, half female - what a strange wedding
Mother Nature has offered us to see
Her mask lays lost in a fatal dawn
Closed were the eyes of the Sun, he sleeps
And in the name of her father
She will kill, my child kills
You nightly birth, a requiem God can't forget
Your life is but a celebration of his death
Without his thorns in her heart, she wears a shadow as face
A werewolf masquerade, in her eyes the wolfshade
She brought the night and by the night was brought
We are but children of the powers she had set freeYou might also likeEmbed
