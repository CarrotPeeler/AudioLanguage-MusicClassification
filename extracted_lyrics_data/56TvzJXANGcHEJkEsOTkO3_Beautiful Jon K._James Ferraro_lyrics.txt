Oh, oh, oh, everything was bad
No, no, no, nothing lasts forever
No, oh, oh
I've been bad over there
Way too big, catching me like minnows
Keep off my dear, for this is just a moment
Our fate, who knows
Maybe it's time you went
Landing on you
As you make your way around
But you don't mind
Baby, baby, baby, baby
You always held me down
Like the time when you fell
Baby, you belong now
Anything you want
Give you anything you want
It's the last time
Drop me off, you got me way out
You got me out
Can I love tonight
You might also likeNo, no, no, please let a lover sleep
No, no, no, just know that those things
Walking with the devil
How did I get out
The shadows on the wall
Shadows on the wall
Promise I'll be back
Know there is a last time
Know that I'm with you
It'll be the last breath
Oh, the lastEmbed
