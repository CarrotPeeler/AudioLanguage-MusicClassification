2 ContributorsThe Last Century for Man LyricsHere we are
At the beginning of the last century for man
Usin' up parts of the world we haven't even seen or been to
The wretched of the earth exploited by the rich few
What's new?
If you are not outraged
You haven't been paying attention
If you are not outraged
You haven't been listening
God bless America, I mean it
God bless the UK, I mean it
God bless la belle France, I mean it
God help us all
Climb into the car
I know that makes you happy
The sound of your laughter
Will get you so far
Grace or disgrace
Can make you a star these days
Reality pays
Let's decide who the terrorists are
God bless America, I mean it
God bless the UK, I mean it
Hats off to China, & India
And Africa too

Drink all we can
Use all we can
Dow what we can
Screw all we can
Don't miss a chance
In the last century for man
I wanna feel alive
Gas up the 4 wheel drive!..
God bless America, I mean it
God bless the UK, I mean it
God bless our children
And God help us allEmbed
