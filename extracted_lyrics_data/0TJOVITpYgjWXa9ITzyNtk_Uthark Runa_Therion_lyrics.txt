Uthark - code of secrecy
Frey, Frey - god of ecstasy
Rise, rise from Ginnungagap
Chorus:
Enter the path of Runa
And drink from the well of Urd
Taste the fruits of Iduna
Decipher the signs from the north
Hail, hail - God of mysteries!
Hail, Frey, your prosperity
Come forth from the depth of Ur
Rise, rise from eternity
