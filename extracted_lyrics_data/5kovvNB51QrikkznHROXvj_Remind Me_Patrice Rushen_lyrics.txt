12 ContributorsRemind Me Lyrics
I can recall a certain magic in your eyes
I'm under your spell each time that you appear
A kiss so passionate that has me mesmerized
I fall more in love each time that you are near, woah-oh
Starlight, star-bright
Your love shines near or far just like the brightest star, yeah
Sweet things you do
It sets my heart aglow
And I want you to know

They remind me (I'm lucky I'm falling)
Hmm-hmm (In love with you, darling)
Remind me, yeah, yeah (I'm lucky I'm falling)
Hmm-hmm (In love with you, darling)

You hold me close and whisper soft and low
Those three little words that mean so much to me
You know how to make my feelings show
We're just like a song in perfect harmony

You remind me, yeah, yeah (I'm lucky I'm falling)
Hmm-hmm (In love with you, darling)
Remind me, yeah, yeah (I'm lucky I'm falling)
Hmm-hmm (In love with you, darling)
Remind me, yeah, yeah (I'm lucky I'm falling)
Hmm-hmm (In love with you, darling)
Remind me, yeah, yeah (I'm lucky I'm falling)
Hmm-hmm (In love with you, darling)
You might also like
You whisper soft and low
Touch me, hold me
Don't let me go
I love you so
That magic in your eyes
Looked right through me
I'm hypnotized, mesmerized
You whisper soft and low
Touch me, hold me
Don't let me go
I love you so


You remind me (Remind me), yeah, yeah (I'm lucky I'm falling)
Hmm-hmm (In love with you, darling)
Remind me (Remind me), yeah, yeah (I'm lucky I'm falling)
Hmm-hmm (In love with you, darling)

Remind me (Remind me)
You whisper soft and low, touch me, hold me, don't let me go (Yeah, yeah)
I'm lucky I'm falling (I love you so)
(Hmm-hmm) In love with you, darling
Remind me (Remind me)
That magic in your eyes looked right through me (Yeah, yeah)
I'm hypnotized, mesmerized (I'm lucky I'm falling)

Remind me (Remind me)
You whisper soft and low, touch me, hold me, don't let me go (Yeah, yeah)
