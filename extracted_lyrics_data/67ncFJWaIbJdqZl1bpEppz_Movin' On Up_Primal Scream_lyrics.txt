I was blind, now I can see
You made a believer out of me
I was blind, now I can see
You made a believer out of me

I'm movin' on up now
Getting out of the darkness
My light shines on
My light shines on
My light shines on

I was lost, now I'm found
I believe in you, I've got no bounds
I was lost, now I'm found
I believe in you, I've got no bounds

I'm movin' on up now
Getting out of the darkness
My light shines on
My light shines on
My light shines on
(My light shines on)
My light shines on
(My light shines on)
My light shines on
