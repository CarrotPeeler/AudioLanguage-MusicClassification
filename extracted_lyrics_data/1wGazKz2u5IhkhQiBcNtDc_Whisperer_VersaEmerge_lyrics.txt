1 ContributorWhisperer Lyrics
You play my nerves like strings, all upside down
Try to keep straight, my limbs are bonding now
Since a few Aprils ago, endless chase to send away this
Tireless persistence of taste

With a touch of your words
I saw the devil sneak between my fingers
(It's much too familiar)
With a touch of your words
I've learned to reverse (Oh)
It's gotten me nowhere

A deep shade of horizon gold
The constellations remind me I am home

We were lit from the west, our silhouettes
Yet a sight of industrial-ness
As the silence wins over every word

With a touch of your words
I saw the devil sneak between my fingers
(It's much too familiar)
With a touch of your words
I've learned to reverse (Oh)
It's gotten me nowhere
You might also like
What am I supposed to think about?
Wondering round inside out
(It's gotten me nowhere)
Patterns don't feel right
Still speaking like
You know what I'm all about

We were lit from the west, our silhouettes
Yet a sight of industrial-ness
As the silence wins over every word

With a touch of your words
I saw the devil sneak between my fingers
(It's much too familiar)
With a touch of your words
I've learned to reverse (Oh)
It's gotten me nowhere

We were lit from the west, our silhouettes
Yet a sight of industrial-ness
As the silence wins overEmbed
