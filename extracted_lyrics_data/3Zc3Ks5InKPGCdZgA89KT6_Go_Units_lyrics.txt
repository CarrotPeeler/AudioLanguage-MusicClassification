3 ContributorsGo Lyrics
My dad yells I gotta leave
Get into my car, I drive hard
Outside, it's a real nice blur
But inside, I'm just sitting here

I want to be a blur...

I wanna be GO!
I wanna be go, I want to be a blur
I wanna be GO!

Like the blood in my veins
I drive around the same old lanes
With windows up at a hundred & ten
I feel my sigh upon my head

I've never held a girl
As long as this wheel
One two oh
It seem so still
I punch it to the floor
I hit the tape machine
I open up the windows
And listen to the scream (Ahh!)
Now no more time, no more space
Just energy...until I stop some place
You might also like
I want to be a blur, I want to be go
I want to be a blur,  I wanna be GO!

Let's GO!
GO GO GO GO GO GO GO GO....GO!Embed
