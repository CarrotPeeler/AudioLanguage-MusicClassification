6 ContributorsAs Evening Falls LyricsHere we are now
In this god awful state
Where there is nothing to say
Let's lose ourselves in a picture
Dressed for the occasion
Then lock it away, lock it away
Keep asking questions
There's bound to be answers
If anyone's left here
To answer at all
They said we were too weak
You said we were too strong
And I said "I wish you were here"
As evening falls around us
We could choose words like blind
As evening falls around us
We could choose words like blind
As evening falls around us
We could choose words like blind
Words spread too quickly
Like someone's reflection
In somebody's eyes
So save your kisses for some other Sunday
I'm cold and the air's getting thin
You might also likeIs this the distance
That we've always hoped for
Or is this our cue?
We go on dancing
Until our hands fall through
The mirror on the wall
And I said "I wish you were here"
As evening falls around us
We could make ourselves blind
As evening falls around us
We could make ourselves blind
As evening falls around us
We could make ourselves blind
As evening falls around us
We could make ourselves blind1Embed
