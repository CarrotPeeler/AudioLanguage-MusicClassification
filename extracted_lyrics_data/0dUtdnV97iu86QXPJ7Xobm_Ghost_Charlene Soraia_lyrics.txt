The dog that's scratching at your door
I'm the nagging guilty feeling
You can't find a reason for
I'm the rattle of your window
That always keeps you half awake
I'm the ink stain on her love letter
I'm the cold you just can't shake
And every day I cry for you
And wish that you were crying too
But you don't feel my pain
You don't see my sorrow
And the thing that hurts the most
Is I'm just a ghost
I'm the frayed thread on your jacket
That always links you to the crime
I'm your victim and your accomplice
Forever frozen here in time
And I live in the shadow lands
Of hopeless dreams and shifting sands, but
You don't feel my pain
You don't see my sorrow
And the thing that hurts the most
Is I'm just a ghost
You might also likeI miss the way you used to taste
I miss your touch and face
Your secret place but
You don't feel my pain
You don't see my sorrow
And the thing that hurts the most
Is I'm just a ghost
You don't feel my pain
You don't see my sorrow
And the thing that hurts the most
Is I'm just a ghostâ€¦Embed
