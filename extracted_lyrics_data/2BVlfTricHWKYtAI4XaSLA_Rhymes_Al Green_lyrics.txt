Last night and the night before
Twenty-five robbers at my door
I got up and let 'em in
But I missed 'em all with a rollin' pin

Alright they took everything I own
Like a king down from his throne
I can't let it get me down
Yeah-ah-ah-ah
Change my smile into a frown
Oh hey yeah -eh

I can't let it get me down
Change my smile into a frown

Just all about to send it southside
Even though I know you are tired, yeah
Now it's time for love again
Pain is found and finally went

Took everything I own
Like a king without his throne
I can't let it get me down
Change my smile into a frown
You might also like
I can't let it get me down
Change my smile into a frown
All is fair in love and war
What are you fightin' here for?
Time about to right just one
There's no cost and there's no fun

Yeah hey hey hey
It'll never happen again
But it has to end
I can't let it get me down
Change my smile into a frown

I can't let it get me down
Change my smile into a frown

I'm throughEmbed
