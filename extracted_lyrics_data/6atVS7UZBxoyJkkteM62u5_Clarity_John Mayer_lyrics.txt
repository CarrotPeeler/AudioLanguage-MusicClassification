I worry
I weigh three times my body
I worry
I throw my fear around
But this morning
There's a calm I can't explain
The rock candy's melted, only diamonds now remain
Ooo-ooo
Ooo-ooo

By the time I recognize this moment
This moment will be gone
But I will bend the light pretending that it somehow lingered on
When all I got's
Ooo-ooo, ooo-ooo
Ooo-ooo, ooo-ooo

And I will wait to find
If this will last forever
And I will wait to find
If this will last forever
And I will pay no mind
When it won't and it won't because it can't
It just can't
It's not supposed to
You might also like
Was there a second of time that I looked around?
Did I sail through or drop my anchor down?
Was anything enough to kiss the ground
And say I'm here now?
And she is here now
Ooo-ooo, ooo-ooo
Ooo-ooo, ooo-ooo

So much wasted in the afternoon
So much sacred in the month of June
How 'bout you, oh?

And I will wait to find
If this will last forever, yeah
And I will wait to find
That it won't and it won't
And it won't
And I will pay no mind
Worried 'bout no rainy weather
And I will waste no time
Remaining in our lives together5Embed
