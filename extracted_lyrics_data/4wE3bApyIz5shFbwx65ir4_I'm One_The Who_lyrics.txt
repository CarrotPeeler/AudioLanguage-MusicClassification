16 ContributorsIâ€™m One Lyrics
Every year, it's the same and I feel it again
I'm a loser, no chance to win
Leaves start falling, comedown is calling
Loneliness starts sinking in

But I'm one, I am one
And I can see that this is me
And I will be
You'll all see I'm the one

Where do you get those blue, blue jeans?
Faded, patched secret, so tight
Where do you get that walk, oh so lean
Your shoes and your shirts all just right

I'm one, I am one
And I can see that this is me
And I will be
You'll all see I'm the one

I've got a Gibson without a case
But I can't get that even-tanned look on my face
Ill-fitting clothes and I blend in the crowd
Fingers so clumsy, voice too loud
You might also like
But I'm one, I am one
And I can see that this is me
And I will be
You'll all see I'm the one

I'm the one
I'm the oneEmbed
