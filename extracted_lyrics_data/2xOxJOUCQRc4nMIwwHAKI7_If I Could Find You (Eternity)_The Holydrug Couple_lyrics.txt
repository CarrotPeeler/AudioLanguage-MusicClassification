6 ContributorsIf I Could Find You (Eternity) Lyrics
Ah, ah-ah-ah
If I could reach you there
But it's over now, I guess
If only
Ah, ah-ah-ah
And tell you
It's all you need to say
Ay-ay, ay-ay
I'll fall again


I love how many
Times we need
I don't see too much
About it
If only
Ah, ah-ah-ah
Forgive yourself for me
That's exactly how it goes
Eternity

Oh, oh, ah
Oh, oh, ah-ah-ah
Oh, oh, ah
Oh, oh, ah-ah-ahYou might also like1Embed
