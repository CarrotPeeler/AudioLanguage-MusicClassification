You dey make i wanna fall in love
Every time we dey whether night or day
See my love for you can never die
My heart beats po po po pom my heart beats po po pop pom
My heart beats po po po pom just for you
My heart beats po po po pom my heart beats po po pop pom
My heart beats po po po pom just for you just for you
For the rest of my life
Champagne lifestyle with the wife
Range rovers maybe like 5
Stocks purses made of croc skin
I know the hard time sucks
Seen it all been through the muddy waters
Trust fund for my son and my daughter
Anybody wan touch i go slaughter
I go be star for your eyes
You taught me how to aim for the skies
You taught me how to save for the rainy day
Put money aside and plan further
To be honest i wan stutter
Music biz got me flipping like a nada
But you calm my head like cold water
Big Bliss black twined in silver
Everytime we dey whether night or day
You dey make i wanna fall in love
Everytime we dey whether night or day
See my love for you can never die
My heart beats po po po pom my heart beats po po pop pom
My heart beats po po po pom just for you
My heart beats po po po pom my heart beats po po pop pom
My heart beats po po po pom just for you just for you
My heart goes beep beep beep beep
Anytime you ring ring ring ring
When we stroll tick tick tick tick
You dey make me sing sing sing sing
Oh love
Without you am so lonely
I promise to love you only
Thats why am down on my knees yeah
I will die for you
Whatever you say i will try for you
To the top of the world i go carry you
Baby say yes i wan marry you
Nobody like you
E don tey wey i dey find you
Anything you want i go buy 2
Mrs W na your title
Everytime we dey whether night or day
You dey make i wanna fall in love
Everytime we dey whether night or day
See my love for you can never die
My heart beats po po po pom my heart beats po po pop pom
My heart beats po po po pom just for you
My heart beats po po po pom my heart beats po po pop pom
My heart beats po po po pom just for you just for you
For better of worse whether profit or loss
You stay loyal never turn co
Never switch teams even when we drop points
Back in the lab writing more money mad joints
And the reason why i hustle non stop
So you can speed in the **** when you drop top
I dey follow you bumper to bumper
Next stop we gop chop lunch New Yorker
Everytime we dey whether night or day
You dey make i wanna fall in love
Everytime we dey whether night or day
See my love for you can never die
My heart beats po po po pom my heart beats po po pop pom
My heart beats po po po pom just for you
My heart beats po po po pom my heart beats po po pop pom
My heart beats po po po pom just for you
Just for you just for you
Just for you only you
Only you just for you
Only you just for you
Just for youYou might also likeEmbed
