Mary's boy child Jesus Christ
Was born on Christmas day
And man will live forever more
Because of Christmas day

Long time ago in Bethlehem
So the Holy Bible said
Mary's boy child Jesus Christ
Was born on Christmas day

Hark, now hear the angels sing, a king was born today
And man will live forever more
Because of Christmas day
Mary's boy child Jesus christ
Was born on Christmas day

While shepherds watch their flocks by night
They see a bright new shining star
They hear a choir sing a song, the music seemed to come from afar

Hark, now hear the angels sing, a king was born today
And man will live forever more, bеcause of Christmas day

Oh a moment the world was aglow, all thе bells rang out
There were tears of joy and laughter
People shouted, "let everyone know, there is hope for all to find peace"

Oh my Lord, you sent your son to save us
Oh my Lord, your very self you gave us
Oh my Lord, that sin may not enslave us
And love may reign once more
Oh my Lord, when in the crib they found him
Oh my Lord, a golden halo crowned him
Oh my Lord, they gathered all around him
To see him and adore (This day will live forever)
Oh my Lord, they had become to doubt you (So praise the lord)
Oh my Lord, what did they know about you? (He is the truth forever)
Oh my Lord, but they were lost without you (So praise the lord)
They needed you so bad (His light is shining on us all)
Oh my lord, with the child's adoration (So praise the lord)
Oh my Lord, there came great jubilation (He is a jubilation)
Oh my Lord, and full of admiration (So praise the lord)
They realized what they had (Until the sun falls from the sky)
Oh my Lord, you sent your son to save us (Oh praise the lord)
Oh my Lord, your very self you gave us (This day will live forever)
Oh my LordEmbed
