14 ContributorsCrown of Thorns Lyrics
You ever heard the story of Mr. Faded Glory?
Say he who rides the pony must someday fall
Talking to my Alter, life is what you make it
And if you make it death, well rest your soul away, away
Away, yeah, child

It's a broken kinda feelin', she'd have to tie me to the ceiling
A bad moon's a-comin', better say your prayers, child
I wanna tell you that I love you, but does it really matter?
I just can't stand to see you draggin' down again, again
My baby, again, oh, yeah

So I'm singin'
And this is my kind of love, it's the kind that moves on
It's the kind that leaves me alone, yes it does
And this is my kind of love, it's the kind that moves on
It's the kind that leaves me alone

I used to treat you like a lady, now you're a substitute teacher
This bottle's not a pretty, not a pretty sight, yeah
I owe the man some money, so I'm turnin' over, honey
Say Mr. Faded Glory is-a once again a-doin' time, oh, yeah
You might also like
And this is my kind of love, it's the kind that moves on
It's the kind that leaves me alone, yes, it does, ah
And this is my kind of love, it's the kind that moves on
It's the kind that, it's the kind that, it leave me alone, yeah!

Like a crown of thorns
It's all who you know, yeah
So don't burn your bridges, woman
'Cause someday, yeah


Kick it! Oh, yeah
And this is my kind of love, it's the kind that moves on
It's the kind that leaves me alone, yeah
And this is my kind of love, it's the kind that moves on
It's the kind that, it's the kind that, yeah, yeah

Baby, I said a-come on, come on, come on, come on, do it!
I said a-baby
Don't burn your bridges, woman
I'm gonna come back to you1Embed
