2 ContributorsDreamy Lyrics
I will wait you
Just come on now
Anytime you want
I will open
All my doors
I haven't count them all
Tonight they
Have seen me
You don't know how
I'll remember where to go
I will wait for two nights more
You don't seem to hear me at all
Come on, come on, come on

Tonight they...
Have seen me...
I will always...You might also like1Embed
