2 ContributorsGolddigger LyricsJust a lazy cat in a dog eat dog world
You know the pretty bird always catches the worm
Got a rocket in your pocket headed straight to the top
The simple life's a joke some fools never learn
Her mission and condition is ease
Ambition helps her do as she please
Golddigger
Golddigger
Golddigger
Who says you can't have it all
Cause baby nothing for free
No money don't grow on trees
Golddigger
Got a sweet little daddy yeah a pretty good scene
He's got a house on the hill and he's swimming in green
Always party on the A-list there's no need to wait
Got a pretty thing on the side of his plate
His mission and condition is ease
Ambition helps him do as he please
Golddigger

Golddigger
Who says you can't have it all
Cause baby nothing for free
No money don't grow on trees
Golddigger

A fizzle's all you get in the end
I'll take Manhattan I won't even pretend
You can give love to the birds and the bees
Golddigger

Golddigger
Who says you can't have it all
Cause baby nothins for free
No money don't grow on trees

Catching flys whith honey
No need to crawl
Who says you can't have it all
Cause baby nothins for free
No money don't grow on trees
