2 ContributorsRising LyricsI got caught in a storm
And carried away
I got turned, turned around
I got caught in a storm
That's what happened to me
So I didn't call
And you didn't see me for a while
I was rising up
Hitting the ground
And breaking and breaking
I got caught in a storm
Things were flying around
Doors were slamming
And windows were breaking
And I couldn't hear what you were saying
I couldn't hear what you were saying
I couldn't hear what you were saying
I was rising up
Hitting the ground
And breaking and breaking
Rising up
