1 ContributorRoses Lyrics{Ad lib: Leo singing]


I pray
That your reason
To live by faith in Jesus may never fall
To the wailing witters trying to deaden your growth just like the wearied winter In Adam’s fall
Recall He's words that with you He wants to
Be one
If you were to find yourself in such a
Season
Just observe that in the darkness there’s a beacon
Of light calling you to life
{Wilfredo]
The spirit of the Lord is trying to spring you back
So you can wisecrack the enemy’s attacks
With the character grown through the tribulation and the rain
Sweetness of joy can’t exist without the pain
Jesus knows your able, Satan wants to keep you caned
And chained in the slavish routine that you're caged in
While all along the Savior is patiently waiting
For you to grab his hand so that you can understand
The Present Truth
With Him,f you are an overcomer
Being led into eternal summer
To wake you from your sabbath slumber
So, wake up
You might also like
Roses always seem to die
In the wintertime
Before the storm passes by
Roses always come alive
In the springtime
After the storm passes by

And my continual prayer
Is that your feelings don’t flare
Causing you to repeat
The melodies of despair
When you’re feeling alone
And that nobody cares
And you’re questioning where's God
If anyone’s there
Or you’re grieving a loved one
You missed that is gone
Or you’re grieving a loved one
That’s alive but moved on
And you’re down and you’re worth
Thinking you’re not enough
Police by insecurities for so long that you’re cuffed
To fear, my dear don’t be overtaken
But the darkness is trying to keep the Son eclipsed
Or lies that you’re nothing or it’s pointless to exist
You’re worth is found in him
The One forsaken on a crucifix, yeah
Satan knows you able, Jesus wants to keep you armed
And aimed in, breaking cycles that you're trained in
While all along there are others that are desperately waiting
For you to grab their hand so they can understand
The Precious Truth
With Christ of the are overcomers
Being led into eternal wonder
If He loves you? You will never wonder
So, stay up
