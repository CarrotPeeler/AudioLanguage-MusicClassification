Hooo yeah, hooo yeah
You know we had to do again right? huh huh
Yeah
Hooo yeah, hooo yeah
Now just incase you forgot
It went on something like... this
On and on and on and on
That's right
(Ooooohhh) It's me again

I remember the very first time that I met you
Couldn't take these eyes off you
There was so much I wanted to do with you babe
Ooh yeah, yeah yeah babe
Made a vow that I'd always be here
No matter what, just the two of us
I am so sprung on you, I don't know what to do
I am so in love with you
Let me hear those sound yeah

Do you like the way it sounds when I put it down
When I make the noise like I do
Ooh ooh ooh ooh, oh oh ohhh
My body tastes like butterscotch
When you lick the spot, you lick up and down
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
You qualify, let's do what freaks do
