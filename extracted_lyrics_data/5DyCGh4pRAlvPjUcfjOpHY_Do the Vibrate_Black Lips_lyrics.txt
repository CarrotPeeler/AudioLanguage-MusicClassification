Rock and roll.. don't mess around
Looking like Elvis.. from the waist down
Lick my love.. from the dire meek
Shut your eyes.. we'll make them dilate

But it makes two to mate, wanna vibrate?
Put your phone in your crotch
And set it on vibrate
Do the vibrate!
Do the vibrate!
Do the vibrate!

Little fly.. stuck in the web
About some ring tones.. stuck in your head
My OCD.. making you blue
You will be burning.. when it goes down on you


All I'm trying to say... (is)
You'll get a pick up darlingYou might also likeEmbed
