You are my fairy-tale
Don't you wanna stay?
You are my fairy-tale
I hope that you don't run away

Now we should run away
I can now hear them tapping on the ground
Where do we wanna go?
I know an ambush where we won't be found

So we went to the place, honey
Listening to the all-night-singing-sweet-melodies-fairy trees
And there is no better place to be
And so we took off to the moon
And all the shining lights in the night

You are my fairy-tale
Don't you wanna stay?
You are my fairy-tale
I hope that you don't run away

You are my fairy-tale
Don't you wanna stay?
You are my fairy-tale
I hope that you don't run away
You might also like
You are my fairy-tale
Don't you wanna stay?
You are my fairy-tale
I hope that you don't run away

You are my fairy-tale
You are my fairy-tale
You are my fairy-tale
You are my fairy-tale
Don't you wanna stay?
You are my fairy-tale
Hope you don't run away10Embed
