5 ContributorsThis Godless Endeavor Lyrics
And on the open road
We came to a sign
For it was foretold
That the weak would inherit and nothing would change
Here we are at the crossroads
Standing face to back
Still afraid to see our eyes
I feel helpless and alone
Trapped on the third stone

Godless are we
Godless are we

Sitting here sideways on a cold stone floor
My guitar gently bleeding and wanting more
When I heard a sound come rapping, tapping on my door
"Hello, I'm happy to meet you" (In your confidence, is it safe)
"Sit down, I'm happy to greet you" (To feed your greedy dog at the edge of the stage?)
"But before, before you slam the door
Tell me when, tell me why, tell me what this fucking life is for"
We fly through this godless endeavor
We try to explain the black forever
You might also like
I feel helpless and alone
Trapped on the third stone


I feel permanently stoned
This godless endeavor
The only cage I've known

Our organic equation has shown its flaw
Can we agree to disagree on the concept of God?
As I lifted up my brother, he said to me
"Abandon naive realism
Surrender thought in cold precision"

I feel empty and deranged
Denied one last epiphany and ushered from the stage

Thou shalt not question, the role of science is not to eliminate God
As alternative gods multiply, science stands accused of theocide
Consume
Conform
Consume
Conform

The children sitting in the trees
They turn to laugh at me
They tell me that I'm insane
But in my mind, I know I'm to blame
Alone within my lunacy
Dementia fills the void within me
No testament, prayer, or diseased lament
Can heal my wounds, they are so discontent

All the faithful fall onto their knees
And praise the priests of industrial disease

We contemplate oblivion
As we resonate our dissonance
In godless, random interpretation
The universe still expands
Mankind still can't understand
How to define you
So hide your face
And watch us exterminate ourselves over you
Welcome to the end, my friend
The sky has opened2Embed
