Sunday morning all alone again
So I ring you up for consolation
Hop the underground I'll meet you at the
Station
I've got a little game that we can play
I've saved it specially for a rainy day
We don't even have to leave my flat
The rules are simple you can bet on that
Let's play shag tag baby
(Run around with nothing on)
Let's play shag tag baby
(We'll do it till the clouds are gone)
Let's play shag tag Uh huh
You're it!
Do you remember how we used to play
Running 'round the playground everyday
Now we're tied to adult situations
The rules for play have different connotations
Take your cloths off
Find a hiding spot
I'll count to ten and girl I'll get you hot
And after all the games are said and done
We'll cuddle up together and make some love

(Run around with nothing on)
Let's play shag tag
(We'll do it till the clouds are gone)
Let's play shag tag Uh huh
You're it!
Every time I feel the way I do today
I think of you and it seems a little better
And in this gloomy world of ours
The games we play
Are magical
And sexual
And wonderful
So come to me and save me girl today
Let's play shag tag baby
(Run around with nothing on)
Let's play shag tag
(We'll do it till the clouds are gone)
Let's play shag tag Uh huhEmbed
