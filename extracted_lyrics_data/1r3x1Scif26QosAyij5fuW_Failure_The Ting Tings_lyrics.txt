F-A-I-L-U-R-E
Woo
:
We might as well be giving up all the time
When we've got only one thing on our mind
So someone come and tell us what to do
We're so excited, so delighted
:
Walk away
Crawl under the table, what I say
Oh, hold it in my hand now, what I may
And everything I do it gets the pace
I'm so excited, I'm delighted
:
Not a lady
Not a legend
Not ordinary
Not alternative
No position
No religion
Nothin' related
I might as well be giving up all the time
But I got only one thing on my mind
(F-A-I-L-U-R-E)
Could someone come and tell me what to do
I'm so excited, I'm delighted
I'm an F-A-I-L-U-R-E
Woo
F-A-I-L-U-R-E
F-A-I-L-U-R-E
Woo
