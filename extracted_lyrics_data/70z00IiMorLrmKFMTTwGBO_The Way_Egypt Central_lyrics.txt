3 ContributorsThe Way LyricsHere I lay in candlelight
I'm drenched in shadows
I need a way to get it right
I lost my halo
All the sins for which I am to blame
Closing in I've got to get away
(Chorus)
I'm going crazy
Just thinking about the way
I've missed you lately
And I just have to say
I know you're waiting
But I would never change
I would never change
Any way you try to tame this growing fire
You couldn't take away the pain of my desire
All the ways you crept into my head
Closing in are the last words that you said
(Chorus)
I'm going crazy
Just thinking about the way
I've missed you lately
And I just have to say
I know you're waiting
But I would never change
I would never change
You might also likeSo far away, so far away
I miss your voice, I miss your taste
My chest feels hollow
Another time, another place
And I can't let go
All the sins for which I am to blame
Closing in I got to get away
(Chorus)
I'm going crazy
Just thinking about the way
I've missed you lately
And I just have to say
I know you're waiting
But I would never change
I would never changeEmbed
