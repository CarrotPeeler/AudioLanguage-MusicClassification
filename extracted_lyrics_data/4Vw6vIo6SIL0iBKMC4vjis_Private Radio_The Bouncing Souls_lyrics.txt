Well, I like to rock and I love to roll
When the music's runnin' through my soul
I got no, no place to go
But my own private radio

I met a lot of people that made me feel alright
And the music's got me through the night

Well, I had a drink and I had a smoke
I listened to every word you spoke
Another story, another memory
Another day the way things should be

If I had it my way, everyone would know
How we're livin' in our, our own private radio

(Private radio) Private radio, private radio
(Private radio) Private radio, private radio
(Private radio) Private radio, private radio
(Private radio) Private radio, private radio
