Listen
(Ohh, ohh
Ohh, ohh)

I'm sick of all this waiting
And people telling me what I should be
What if I'm not so crazy?
Maybe you're the one who's wrong, not me

So what you gonna, what you gonna say
When we're standing on top and do it our way?
You say we got no future
You're living in the past
So listen up, that's my generation

(Hey ho, let's go!)
It's going down tonight
(Hey ho, let's go!)
We're gonna do it until we die
(Hey ho, let's go!)
'Cause I, I, I got no reason to apologize
That's my generation
(Ohh, ohh
Ohh, ohh)

When we're standing on top and do it our way?
