2 ContributorsWhatâ€™s The Colour Of Money LyricsDull my senses
Steal my pride
Principles denied
Passion faked and sold to the anthem green and gold
Colour of the virtue by working like a slave
More precious than life? itself
What's the colour tempting fate?
What's the colour of money
What's the colour of money?
Don't tell me that you think it's green
Me I know it's red
What's the colour of money
What's the colour of money?
Don't tell me that you think it's green
Me I know it's red!
Dull my senses
Steal my pride
Principles denied
Passion faked and sold to the anthem green and gold
What was a useful tool
Has taken our control?
It takes away your hearts and wraps it up around your soul
What's the colour of money
What's the colour of money? . . 
What's the colour of money
What's the colour of money?
I know it's red
I know it's red!
Dull my senses
Steal my pride
Principles denied
Passion faked and sold to the anthem green and gold
Colour of th.e virtue by working like a slave
More precious than life itself
Familiarity breeds contempt
What's the colour of money
What's the colour of money? . .
