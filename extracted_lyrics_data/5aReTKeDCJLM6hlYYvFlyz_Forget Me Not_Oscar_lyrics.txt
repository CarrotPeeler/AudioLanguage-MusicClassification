1 ContributorForget Me Not Lyrics
You try to forget me but you can't
You'll do anything that you want
But I won't try anymore
The more that you ask me
It's the same
And you have a girl in your brain
That I don't know what's the score
You're so vain
How do you do it?
Next time they'll be no reply

You try to forget me but you can't
(Tried, tried, tried, tried)
You'll do anything that you want
(I'll forget you all the time)
You try to forget me but you can't
(Tried, tried, tried, tried)
You'll do anything that you want
(I'll forget you all the time)

The troubles you see
They are so real
So bad how you're making me feel
So why do you know thе score?
You might also like
Wait for me to say I'm sorry
Wait for me to say I'm sorry
Wait for mе to say I'm sorry
Wait for me to say I'm sorry but I'm not

You try to forget me but you can't
(Tried, tried, tried, tried)
You'll do anything that you want
(I'll forget you all the time)
You try to forget me but you can't
(Tried, tried, tried, tried)
You'll do anything that you want
(I'll forget you all the time)
You try to forget me but you can't
(Tried, tried, tried, tried)
You'll do anything that you want
(I'll forget you all the time)
You try to forget me but you can't
(Tried, tried, tried, tried)
You'll do anything that you want
(I'll forget you all the time)Embed
