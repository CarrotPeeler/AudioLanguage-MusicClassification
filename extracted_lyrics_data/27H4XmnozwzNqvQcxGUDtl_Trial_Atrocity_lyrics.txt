1 ContributorTrial LyricsYou know deep inside me are all out for pain
We're condemning, torturing
Killing again and again
Waiting for deliverance
Being nailed to the cross
Hanging there like Jesus Christ
But without his graceful sight
Suspected animation, antagonized to die
Make your last confession within tonight
Heads I win
Tails you lose
Blackest sin
Trial by ordeal
Forced smile, frozen face, annoyed arch enemy
No weakness, no frailty even without empathy
Your mind is closed, disturbing fortitude
Hatred, fear, melt into a mental beast
Forced to fight
Steel annealed
Prepare to strike
Trial by ordeal
You might also likeDemolishing anger, concentrated violence
Attempt conquest
No mental anguish, warrant of distress
Unfailing strength, unflagging opponents
At blood, hit the inner conflict
Trial by ordeal decides your life or death
Pouring out the veils of wrath and damnation
Taking a delight in an unholy domain
Blasphemous, unholy
Benedicted under God's nameEmbed
