2 ContributorsShame the Devil Lyrics
There's a time, for living
And a time for love
There's a time, for forgiving, y'all
And a time to shove
Ohh there's more, won then lost
More hoping here to spare
And it's waiting, waiting
Don't ya spend your whole life hesitating
Come and tell the truth
Shame the devil

There's more, light than dark
Honey shining down on you
More despair, than what you got
And baby you'll need the truth
This whole world, has had enough
Of people giving up
And it's waiting, waiting
Don't you spend your whole life hesitating
Come on tell the truth
Shame the devil

And its waiting, waiting
Don't spend your whole life hesitating
Come on tell the truth
Shame the devil
Don't you know that it's waiting, ah waiting
Don't you spend your whole life hesitating
Come on, let loose
