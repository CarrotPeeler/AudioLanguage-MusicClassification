11 ContributorsForget It Lyrics
I feel unique
Not yet complete
And your steaming eyes fall on me
Poor me
Poor you
Poor us
A fuss, a fight
So I sat outside, outside

I am not your savior
I am not your savior, baby girl
I am not your savior
I am not your savior

One, two, three, Fort Greene
We meet, I'm incomplete
And your freezing thighs warm me
Poor me
Poor you
Poor us
What's wrong with a little touch?
I am just a boy
I'm so lonely
You might also like
I am not your savior
I am not your savior, baby girl
I am not your savior
I am not your savior


I am not your savior
I am not your savior, baby girl
I am not your savior
Hurry
I am not your savior, oh no
Hurry
I am not your savior, oh no
I am not your savior, baby girl
I am not your savior
Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry
I'm not your savior, oh no
I am not your savior, baby girl
I am not your savior, oh oh oh oh
Hurry, I'm not your savior, oh no
I am not your savior, baby girl
I am not your savior
Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry
I'm not your savior1Embed
