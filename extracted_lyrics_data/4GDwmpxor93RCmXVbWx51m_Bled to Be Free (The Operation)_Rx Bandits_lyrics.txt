2 ContributorsBled To Be Free (The Operation) LyricsIf you never heal, how you gonna love again?
Match my reflection, mask your heart with mine
Tricked by deception, shot my only friend
Burned down connection, we've said goodbye
Cut the memory, make it short and sweet
What chances are left when you lost the time?
Thought I could leave her but she caught up with me
An ocean of emptiness and nothing to hide
Oh, it's alright
Yeah, it's about time
My lover girl
I told you so
Now it's arrived
Now it's about time
My baby girl
I told you so
If you never fall, how you gonna learn to fly?
We've bled indecision, if they only knew
Hands lost their hold, eyes rained goodbye
Our hands are untied now, these games finalized
Bled to be free, bled so foolish
Been cut to pieces, there's little left inside
Oh, how I loved her, how I loved her so
But love will grow swiftly, just don't let it die

Yeah, it's about time
My lover girl
I told you so
Now it's arrived
And it's about time
My baby girl
I told you so
It's a long, long way back home again
Operation! (operation!)
Never win out, baby, never get out
Honey, never get
Operation! (operation!)
Never win out, baby, never get out
You'll never get
Operation! (operation!)
Never win out, honey, never get out
No you'll never getEmbed
