1 ContributorLove’s Labour Lost LyricsThere's shakespeare on the phone again
Mentions his days with juliet
Complains about his fellow romeo
And all the trouble that he had
So, william, here we are again
It's time to clear the scene
Remember when you failed the other day
When you tried to tame katharine
Love's labour's lost
With fancy poems on filthy paper
Roses stolen in a park
Cheap potions of romantic vapour
You wouldn't even catch a lark
There's shakespeare on the phone again
Under his leading lady's spell
It's me who has to tell you this
He can not write it down so wellYou might also likeEmbed
