Love me tender, love me good
Come get these 30 minutes of trust
Know you wish you could
Stay a little longer
Your marriage in the mud
Your wife and kids don’t know
Love your stamina
Illusional thoughts
Of me making you happy
Holding you down
Me being your queen
But her wearing my crown
Expressional anxiety states
I think might fall
For something thats unfamiliar
I don’t know what to call
A orphanage
Mash wire, child abuse and snow
Between 50 little girls
I was that little girl thats been bold
My body, their property, no control
No traces of the higher power
Lost my soul
They said my daddy was abroad
My granny found me
Said i wanna bring you home
May you allow me ?
Then she whispered something in my ear
Kinda odd
Keep your faith little rose
And know that God is love
Yea

I’m not the one you see that sits behind the curtain
I wouldn’t dare to lift that veil
Forgive my eyes if they appear to be uncertain
I’m somewhere lost in heavens hell



I feel like hope
Whenever your hand touches my thighs
Sweettalking my lies
Moments never last for ever
So i rather stay blind, see the trust in your eyes
It’s like love when you deliver
Shut doors whenever you in
Creds under the piller
I know my job
I gotta follow rules
And i only follow rules
When it comes to you
Lust and trust makes love
At least that what i’ve heard
While i treat them like my clients
Ima treat you like you’re my first
Let me satisfy the thirst
So you can make it to church
And i make it to your service
Catch me quoting all your words
13 hickies
Reminding of the verse of corinthians
My patience is a virtue
I am suppressing my principles
I know this bond is deep
As the veneer of my feelings is
Although i am a realist, i dare to dream
Proximity is what need
It’s x and o every time i hear you preach
So when i feel like killing myself
To choke the odds
Sou come around
And whisper in my ear that God is love
Yeah

I’m not the one you see that sits behind the curtain
I wouldn’t dare to lift that veil
Forgive my eyes if they appear to be uncertain
I’m somewhere lost in heavens hell


White leather seats with the tints up
Imma show you how to sin some
Put the seats down real low
You don’t want no one to see you
Pull up to the curb with the lights off
Get to doin what you like now
Costs more for the real love
If you really wanna feel love
What’s Love?
What’s Love?
What’s Love?
If I’ve never know
What’s Love if I’ve never x 32Embed
