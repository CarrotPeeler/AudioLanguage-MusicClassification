4 ContributorsIf You Go Away LyricsIf you go away On this summer day
Then you might as well Take the sun away
All the birds that flew In the summer sky
When our love was new And our hearts were high
When the day was young And the night was long
And the moon stood still For the night bird's song
If you go away
If you go away
If you go away
But if you stay I'll make you a day
Like no day has been Or will be again
We'll sail the sun We'll ride on the rain
We'll talk to the trees We'll worship the wind
And if you go I'll understand
Leave me just enough love To hold in my hand
If you go away
If you go away
If you go away
As I know you must There'll be nothing left
In the world to trust Just an empty room
Full of empty space Like the empty look
I see on your face I've been the shadow
Of your shadow I fell you might have kept me By your side
You might also likeIf you go away
If you go away
But if You stay I'll make you a day
Like no day has been Or will be again
We'll sail the sun We'll ride on the rain
We'll talk to the trees We'll worship the wind
And if you go I'll understand
Leave me just enough love To hold in my hand
If you go away
If you go away
Ne me quitte pasEmbed
