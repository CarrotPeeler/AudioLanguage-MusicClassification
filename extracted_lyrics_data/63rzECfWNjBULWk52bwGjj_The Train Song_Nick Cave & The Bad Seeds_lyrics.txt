5 ContributorsThe Train Song Lyrics
Tell me how long's the train been gone?
Tell me how long's the train been gone?
And was she there?
And was she there?
Tell me how long's the train been gone?

Tell me how many coaches long?
Tell me how many coaches long?
What did she wear?
And what did she wear?
Tell me how many coaches long?

Tell me when did the whistle blow?
Tell me when did the whistle blow?
And did she tie her hair?
And did she tie her hair?
Tell me when did the whistle blow?

Tell me how long's the train been gone?
Tell me how long's the train been gone?
And was she there?
And was she there?
Tell me how long's the train been gone?See Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds LiveGet tickets as low as $59You might also likeEmbed
