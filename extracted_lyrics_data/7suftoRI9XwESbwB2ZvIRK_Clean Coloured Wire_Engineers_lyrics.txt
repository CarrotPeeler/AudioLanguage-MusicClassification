1 ContributorClean Coloured Wire LyricsTake it all away
Did you hide and make yourself
Straight to halt their pleas
All the signs are there
Respite from what you feel
Given time we’ve learned to share
Don’t compensate for me
Will I find you there
Do my best to steer my goals
Clean coloured wire makes the right hole
(Do my best to steer my goals
Please pull in tight make the right hole)
Try to make me stay
Had to fight for recompense
Don’t put the blame on me
All the signs are there
Filtered by a friend
Even time’s not playing fair
Don’t pin your hopes on me
Still I find you thereYou might also likeEmbed
