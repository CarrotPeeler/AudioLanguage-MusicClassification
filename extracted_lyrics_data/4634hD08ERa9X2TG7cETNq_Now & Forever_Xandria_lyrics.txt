6 ContributorsNow & Forever Lyrics
Millions of songs, all those years in my soul
And when we met, I just knew they're for you
Now your voice is singing them all
Your wings at mine, we will never fall
On and on

We will fly now & forever
Side to side, now & forever, my love

Thousands of miles through the cold stormy air
There's really nothing that I wouldn't dare
I climb the eye of the hurricane
When the winds are whispering your name
On and on

We will fly now & forever
Side to side, now & forever, my love

Now & forever, now & forever
(Now & forever)
Fly, fly, now & forever
(Now & forever)
Now & forever
You might also like
We will fly now & forever
Side to side, now & forever
Fly with you, now & forever
Be with you, now & forever
My loveEmbed
