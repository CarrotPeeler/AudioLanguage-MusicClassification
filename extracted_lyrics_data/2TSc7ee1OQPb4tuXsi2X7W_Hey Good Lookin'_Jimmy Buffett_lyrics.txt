6 ContributorsHey Good Lookinâ€™ Lyrics
Hey, hey good lookin'
What you got cookin'?
How's about cookin' somethin' up with me?

Hey, hey, sweet baby
Don't you think maybe
We could find us a brand new recipe?

I got a hot rod Ford
And a two-dollar bill
And I know a spot
Right over the hill

There's soda pop
And the dancing's free
If you wanna have fun
Come along with me

Hey good lookin'
What you got cookin'?
How's about cookin' somethin' up with me?
You might also like
Let's stir it up, boys!

I'm free and I'm ready
Maybe we can go steady
How's about saving all your time for me?

No more lookin'
I know I've been took in
How's about keepin' steady company?

Well, I'm gonna throw my datebook
Over the fence
And find me one
For five or ten cents

I'll keep it
'Til it's covered with age
'Cause I'm writing your name
Down on every page

Hey, hey good lookin'
What you got cookin'?
How's about cookin' something up with me?
How's about cookin' something up with me?
How's about cookin' something up with me?Embed
