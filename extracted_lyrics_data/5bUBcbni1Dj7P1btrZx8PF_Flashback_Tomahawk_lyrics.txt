The dolls, the hide-and-seek
We dreamed of better things
In the tall weeds
I rolled with you
Flashback
Silhouette of the memory
You're eyes are getting heavy
And when I speak
You sleep on cue
3, 2, 1
Did they make you wear a dress, did they?
Held you down and tickled you, did they?
Did they laugh and make you watch, did they?
They wish they had a little girlie
Come closer take a look inside
Flashback
Blueprints have been erased
Matchbooks, butterflies, no wings
The grass was wet
I rolled with you

Tentacles of my spirit grow
Sit back, relax and hope
The second time ain't like the first
I'm a schoolboy why don't you teach me
Bend over and we'll hush the squealing
Put on the mask and dance for daddy
Wait for the world to say it's sorry
You show me yours, I'll show you mine

Listen to the song my blood is singing
Listen to the song my blood is drivin', drivin', drivin', drivin' at youEmbed
