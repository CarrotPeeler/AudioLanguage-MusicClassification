2 ContributorsThe Beggar’s Last Dime LyricsWe all live with that cliché: the underdog, the poor
From the void makes it big time, a miracle in store
The working class, true believers of this fairytale
Suffering hard every day to buy their stocks 'n' rates
Follow them, you fools, while they're fucking in their pools
Weep and eat their lies
Follow them, you fools, while they're making all your rules
Let them steal your dimes
Forever and ever the rich is getting fat
By stealing the beggar's last dime
Whatever, no matter, this greed ain't getting better
Stealing the beggar's last dime
The upper class with their millions, keeping all doors locked
And you're not, not invited when they live on top
In this game it's decided who will win or lose
When the rich cashes in the poor man sells his shoes
In the yellow press, where you follow their excess
Wish to be like them
While you dream you've won they are playing with your doe
Oops – and now it's gone
Forever and ever the rich is getting fat
By stealing the beggar's last dime
Whatever, no matter, this greed ain't getting better
Stealing the beggar's last dime
Stealing the beggar's last dime
You might also likeForever and ever the rich is getting fat
Whatever, no matter, the poor is getting madEmbed
