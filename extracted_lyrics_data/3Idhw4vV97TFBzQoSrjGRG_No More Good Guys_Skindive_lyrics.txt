2 ContributorsNo More Good Guys LyricsI died today
But I'm still breathing
Bleeding
For now
I'm broken
You left me here
Capsized and sinking
Thinking, right now
There's no more good guys
You left me standing here
Alone and colder
I hope that some day soon
The pain inside will stop
You died today
But you're still breathing
In my mind
That is
There's no more good guys
You left me standing here
Alone and colder
I hope that some day soon
The pain inside will stop
I hoped you'd see me
I hoped you'd understand
Or crucify me for my failings
My cruel ambition
Hardly justified
And the pain inside will ... stopYou might also likeEmbed
