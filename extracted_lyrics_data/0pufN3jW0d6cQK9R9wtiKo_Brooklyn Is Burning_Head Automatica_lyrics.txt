7 ContributorsBrooklyn Is Burning LyricsYou strangle people with a piercing stare
I can't believe I made it
The way you operate is so severe, so severe
I hate it
You strangle people with a sneering grin
I can't believe I made it
Brooklyn is burning down the discotheque, discotheque
Let's shake it
I feel the fire tonight
I hear, I hear the people cry
I see all the people now
I got, I got what the people want
You send a message in the atmosphere and everyone starts running
The way you operate is so severe, so severe
So cunning
You send a message in your beady stare and everyone starts running
Brooklyn is burning and by fireside, by fireside, we're dancing
I feel the fire tonight
I hear, I hear the people cry
I see all the people now
I got, I got what the people want

Brooklyn is burning down the discotheque, discotheque
