Beneath the burning sun
The raging badlands now is his home
There's no sign of victory
He lost his liberty
And the only woman that he loved
An outlaw chasing outlaws
A runner in the night
By the radiant moon he will strike
The seeker of all dangers
Has come to take his toll
From the dead of night he will arise
Renegade, renegade
Committed the ultimate sin
Renegade, renegade
This time, the prowler will win
He stalks in shadow lands
Soundless with gun in hand
Striking like a reptile, so fierce
No chance to get away
No time for your last prayer
When the prowler
Sneaks up from behind
You might also likeAn outlaw chasing outlaws
The hunter takes his prey
The law of the jungle he obeys
Craving for the danger
To even out the score
Face to face, once and for all
Renegade, renegade
Committed the ultimate sin
Renegade, renegade
This time, the prowler will win
On through the night he rides
On his raging horse made of steel
Nothing can save you now
Before the renegade you will kneel
Renegade, renegade
Committed the ultimate sin
Renegade, renegade
This time, the prowler will win
Renegade, renegade
Committed the ultimate sin
The ultimate sin
Renegade, renegade
This time, the prowler will win
Prowler will winEmbed
