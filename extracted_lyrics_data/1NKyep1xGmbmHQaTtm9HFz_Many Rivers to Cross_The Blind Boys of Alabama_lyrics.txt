1 ContributorMany Rivers to Cross LyricsMany rivers to cross
But I can't seem to find my way over
Wandering I'm lost
As I travel along the white cloffs of dover
Many rivers to cross
And it's only my will that keeps me alive
I've been ripped, washed up for years
And I merely, merely survive
And this loneliness won't leave alone
It's such a drag to be on your own
My spirit is lonely and I don't know why
But I guess I have to try
Many rivers to cross
But I begin, I'm praying
Many rivers to cross
But my way back home I cannot find
Many rivers to cross...You might also likeEmbed
