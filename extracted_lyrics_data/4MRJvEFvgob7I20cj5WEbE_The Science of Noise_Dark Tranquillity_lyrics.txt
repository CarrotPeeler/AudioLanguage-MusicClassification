3 ContributorsThe Science of Noise Lyrics
To connect and make sense of it all
We draw lines through the chaos within
We measure what is everything but real
On our crooked scale

Bend it to our will
Dream it into form
Bend it to our will
Dream it into form
Shape it in our image
The science of noise
Filling the blanks and avert the gaze
Descend upon those
Who trespass against us
Torn from the sheltering safety of faith
As crooked as the come

Bend it to our will
Dream it into form
Bend it to our will
Dream it into form
Shape it in our image
The science of noise
See Dark Tranquillity LiveGet tickets as low as $103You might also like
One clear-cut line
That separates it all
We challenge the void
To bare its secret beyond
We look until we see
What our truth now will be

Bend it to our will
Dream it into form
Bend it to our will
Dream it into form
Shape it in our image
