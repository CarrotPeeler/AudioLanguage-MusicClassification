3 ContributorsKill The Lights Lyrics
When I go walking through the city at night
I see the trash is piling up against the sides of the street
Of the streets when it's day where all the bodies collide
I like to think about this place like it's a dream
A dream I had when I was watching TV
When I was 5, when I was 10, now I'm inside it, here I am
On these streets, with these dreams
On this island, and I'm staying till

Somebody kills the lights
Till somebody kills the lights
Till somebody kills the lights
Up on the old White Way
I'm gonna stay and survive

(Kill the lights)
(Kill the lights)

It's rough sometimes but I am here despite the wars
I fight the ones inside, the rest of them are yours
I'm alive, I'm alive, and I am going to survive
I like to think about this place like I'm not here
Sometimes it's all so overwhelming but let me make this clear
It's a dream so it's partially mine
You try to wreck it with your wrecking machine, I'll cut the wires
Those gals upstairs on Broadway reading lines are okay
While there's still neon in the sign, they're gonna stay until
You might also like
Somebody kills the lights
Till somebody kills the lights
Till somebody kills the lights
Up on the old White Way
The great lady is littering the old White Way
And this dream is mine, and it's going to survive
I'm alive, I'm alive, you're fucking fired

(Kill the lights)
(Kill the lights)
(Kill the lights)
(Kill the lights)
(Kill the lights)
(Kill the lights)

(Street fight tonight)
(Street fight) Oh my God, I'm in Chinatown, looking for my Wookie
(Street fight)
Today just ain't my day, bad luck fortune cookie
Big trouble in Little China, lookout, backflip, yeah someone's behind you
Bad luck, Mr. Fortune Cookie, the cookie's wrong, oh fuck, oh God
(Street fight)
Look at my costume it's covering my face
(Tonight)
Camel toe black, sticky shoes versus cop's mace
(Street fight tonight)
(Street fight tonight)
Street fight, babyEmbed
