3 ContributorsThoughts LyricsThoughts are thinking
Thoughts are coming
Thoughts are screaming
Thoughts keep coming
Thoughts are coming
Thoughts are coming down
Thoughts are thinking; Thunk from knowing
Thoughts repeating; Harm is showing
Thoughts forever keep me going down
I thought my time was almost done
I thought I knew which way to run
I thought of how this began
I thought of where to go for lunch
I thought I'd give her what she wants
I thought the dream makes the man
Bats are crawling on my skin
I hear blood-letting thoughts beginning now

The more I think my thoughts are winning now

Thoughts are coming
Thoughts are screaming
Thoughts keep coming
Thoughts are coming
Thoughts are coming down
I thought oh man, this gig is long
I thought my drink was much too strong
I thought he spoke much too fast
I thought they make me sick
I thought please death come quick
I thought it's too good too last
Our eyes are one; I tunnel in
I hear pathetic thoughts beginning now
Thoughts are thinking
Thoughts are coming
Thoughts are screaming
Thoughts keep coming
The more I try to not give in
The more I think my thoughts are winning now
Thoughts are thinking
Thoughts are coming
Thoughts are screaming
Thoughts keep coming
Thoughts are coming
Thoughts are coming down
Thoughts are thinking; Thunk from knowing
Thoughts repeating; Harm is showing
Thoughts forever keep me going down
Thoughts are like black ravens in the sky
Thoughts will be forever floating by...
Why?...
I thought at last my love at last!
I thought let's go out and get trashed
I thought let's break what we planned
I thought we punish for the crime
I thought we're running out of time
I thought the dream makes the man
Bats are crawling on my skin
I hear blood-letting thoughts beginning now
Thoughts are thinking

Thoughts are coming down
