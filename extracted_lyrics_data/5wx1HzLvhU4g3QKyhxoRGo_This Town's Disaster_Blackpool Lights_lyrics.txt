1 ContributorThis Townâ€™s Disaster LyricsI seem to push motives aside
How many days was last night
On the verge of a collapse
I knew that it would never last
Wasted, this town's disaster is sinking in
And all my world is caving in
All this guilt will weigh me down
The king of pain I'd wear the crown
Battered cliche in moves I make
This was my last mistake
Wasted, this town's disaster is sinking in
And all my world is caving in
Where do I start, I can't begin
This town's disaster is sinking in
A little weak and on and on
Another day and I'll be gone, so gone
Wasted, this town's disaster is sinking in
And all my world is caving in
Where do I start, I can't begin
This town's disaster is sinking inYou might also likeEmbed
