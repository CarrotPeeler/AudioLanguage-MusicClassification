36 ContributorsGo Hard (La.La.La) Lyrics
Hey, bitch
What's up?
You know I'd really like to do that
But I don't have any fucking money
Like, I don't have any fucking money

Hey, bitch, do you really, really, really wanna go hard?
Go in the crib, steal your stepfather's credit card
And take the car and do circles in the parking lot
Scream at the top of our lungs like la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
We on that la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la

Hey, bitch
I see you working at the mall
At Forever 21, selling tanks and shawls
You wanna quit your job? You need a place to go?
Girl, run your own show, but don't be on some hoe shit
Bounce with something cute on
I kiss into a fog zone
I be really off and searching for some water though
What it do, let it go and go hard
Lemme see you do it, go hard, like real hard
You might also like
Hey, bitch, do you really, really, really wanna go hard?
Go in the crib, steal your stepfather's credit card
And take the car and do circles in the parking lot
Scream at the top of our lungs like la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
We on that la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
We got that la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la

Do it like, do it like, do it like
Let me see you go hard, go hard, go hard

Girl, you need that new
Bottles on chill, I got gold chain flu
Little lady on my side, show me how you ride out
Be a good one and I'll take you to my hideout
Pretty little bitch, dripping like some water though
I be on that straw, and coming for that lo-lo
What I did? Let her go, she's back now
She went real hard until she threw her back out

Hey, bitch, do you really, really, really wanna go hard?
Go in the crib, steal your stepfather's credit card
And take the car and do circles in the parking lot
Scream at the top of our lungs like la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
We on that la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
We got that la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Silly girl, take your jacket off
Get off the floor
Go hard, go hard
G-go hard, go hard, go hard
D-D-D-Damn
Do-do-do-do-do it like, do it like, do it like
Let me see you go hard, go hard, go hard
G-go hard, go hard

Hey, bitch, do you really, really, really wanna go hard?
Go in the crib, steal your stepfather's credit card
And take the car and do circles in the parking lot
Scream at the top of our lungs like la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
We on that la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
We got that la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la

Do it like, do it like, do it like
Do it like, do it like, do it like
Let me see you go hard, go hard, go hard
Go hard, go hard, go hard
Do it, do it, do it
Do it like, do it like
Let me see you go hard, go hard, hard, hard
Go hard, go hard, go hard7Embed
