1 ContributorNorth Wind LyricsBlow north wind and tell your story
Of my love mistakes and glory
How I loved and lost my baby, lost my head as well
Tell them how I killed her lover, broke my heart as well
Blow north wind and tell your story
Blow west wind, yeah let it thunder
Tell all the angels way up yonder
How I loved and lost my baby, took her life as well
Tell me I'm forgiven now, donâ€™t send my soul to Hell
Blow west wind and tell my story
Blow west wind, yeah let it thunder
Tell all the angels way up yonder
How I loved and lost my baby, took her life as well
Tell me I'm forgiven now, don't send my soul to Hell
Blow west wind and tell my story
