I will tell your story if you die
I will tell your story and keep you alive the best I can
I will tell them to the children
If we have some, if we have some
But I've always felt the feeling we would die young
Some die young
Some die young
Some—

Some die young, but you better hold on
So many things I need to say to you
Please don't, don't let me go
And we said we would die together
Some die young, but you better hold on
So many things I need to say to you
Please don't, don't let me go
And we said we would die together
Some die young

I will tell your story if you try
But how long will your thoughts of valleys stay green
When the world you were born in changes with seasons?
Will you run with the stream or will you run alone?
Or will you run against and finally reveal
Why some die young
Why some die young
Why some die—

Some die young, but you better hold on
So many things I need to say to you
Please don't, don't let me go
And we said we would die together
Some die young, but you better hold on
So many things I need to say to you
Please don't, don't let me go
And we said we would die together
Some die young, but you better hold on
But you better hold on
So many things I need to say to you
Please don't, don't let me go
And we said we would die together
Some die young

(Some die young)
(She walks with her head in the sand, they will never die)1Embed
