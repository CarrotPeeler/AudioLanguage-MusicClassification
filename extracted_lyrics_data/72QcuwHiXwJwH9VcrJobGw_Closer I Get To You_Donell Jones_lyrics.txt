1 ContributorCloser I Get to You Lyrics
I’ve been tryin to find my way back to you
Just didn’t know how
But I remember you placed a beacon inside my heart
So when I’m close… I’ll know

Girl I’d walk a million miles every day and a million more
If I got to get it in to you
But like a bird with a broken wing, I’ll never fly all the same
Watch me soar
If I gotta get to you
And like the wind of a hurricane I wanna blow your way
Girl I’m that storm
I gotta get to you
Without you I don’t wanna live another day
My heart is torn
I gotta get to you

The closer I get to you
It’s so hard to be away from you
The closer I get to you
It’s so hard to be away from you
The closer I get to you
It’s so hard to be away from you
The closer I get to you
It’s so hard to be away from you
You might also like
Turned away from my love
Uh la la la la
I must be close ‘cause I hear your voice
Uh la la la la
Just keep singing baby
Uh la la la la
And no matter how far you are
Uh la la la la, I’m coming

Girl I want your name inside my heart to prove I’m worth it
I gotta get to you
And when I’ll find you I can promise we will never part
Forever more
I gotta get to you
But I light that beacon so I can see even in the dark
I’m coming for sure
I gotta get to you
Without you it’s kinda like the earth without the core
Baby, I’m lost
I gotta get to you

The closer I get to you
It’s so hard to be away from you
The closer I get to you
It’s so hard to be away from you
The closer I get to you
It’s so hard to be away from you
The closer I get to you
It’s so hard to be away from you
The closer I get to you
It’s so hard to be away from you
The closer I get to you
It’s so hard to be away from you
The closer I get to you
It’s so hard to be away from you
The closer I get to you
It’s so hard to be away from you
‘Cause I can’t stay away from my love
Uh la la la la
I gotta be close
Uh la la la la
I feel your presence
Uh la la la la
I’m near
Uh la la la la
Oh yeahEmbed
