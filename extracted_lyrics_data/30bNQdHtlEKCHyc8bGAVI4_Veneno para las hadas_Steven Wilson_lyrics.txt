6 ContributorsVeneno para las Hadas LyricsWhen you're young, you're sleeping
With the love you're feeling
Waking up to evening
Check the pulse and breathe in
Nothing left, just ember
Only we remember
A bottle not for sharing
Poison for a fairySee Steven Wilson LiveGet tickets as low as $71You might also likeEmbed
