1 ContributorThink for Yourself LyricsYou think you know just what it means
To be alone
You think you've suffered for your cause
You're wrong
I don't really need to know what makes you tick
Or what you think is right
I don't want to know the reason you believe
Right now you're like the others
Your thoughts are not your own
Try thinking for yourself and act on what you know
Still you try to defend these things
You were taught
You've got to try to change the way
You learn
Sometimes it feels just like I've burned
Every single bridge
That I have ever crossed
I always try to learn
From all of these mistakes
Mistakes that I have made
But pride is a worthy adversary
In the struggle for yourselfYou might also likeEmbed
