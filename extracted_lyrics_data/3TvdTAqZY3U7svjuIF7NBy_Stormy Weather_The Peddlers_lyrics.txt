3 ContributorsRainy Day Lyrics
Why did it have to rain today?
I, I'd really like to know!
This country's cursed with stormy weather and it's always cold
This country's cursed with stormy weather and it's always cold
Another wet day
A night on the ruts
A time for the thoughts, and the cats and the dogs
A time for the thoughts, and the cats and the dogs
Why did it have to rain today?
I, I'd really like to know!
This country's cursed with stormy weather and it's always cold
This country's cursed with stormy weather and it's always cold
Avoiding the puddles
The people go fast
Through the red tulips
Or walking on glass
Glass in the streets
And trying our best
Splashed my new trousers and couldn't feel it
Splashed my nеw trousers and couldn't feel it
Why did it have to rain today?
I, I'd really likе to know!
Splashed my new trousers and couldn't feel it
Splashed my new trousers and couldn't feel it
