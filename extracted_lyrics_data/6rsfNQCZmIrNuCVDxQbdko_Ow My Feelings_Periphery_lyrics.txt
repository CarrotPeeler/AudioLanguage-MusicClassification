7 ContributorsOw My Feelings Lyrics
Lost the way
Feel the world below me painlessly ascend
Torn away dissolving the life I know
Grasp the light
Feel the glow enfolding (Exaltation)
Isolate the answers and truth from lies

Loss of faith
The path unravels before me
Unholy day
I'm letting go (Letting go)

Void the past, create the new
Separate the few because I hold ability to lead astray
Now living through every day
On the path between the frozen lines

Now no one ever will know about this experience
Will someone for once step back
And gaze upon this world through my eyes?

Drawn behind the point of view
Seal us from the truth
On our own, the fear of life decays
Time alone reveals our fatal aspect of arrogance
In life, we're not the only ones
Free from the walls, I'm alive
You might also like
Lost the way
The path unravels before me
Unholy day
I'm letting go

Through time these cries distort the view
Hopeless misdirection
We all defy the chance to know
This world is not the one I knew
Holding tight to our beliefs
Awake to what we have become

Now no one ever will know about this experience
Will someone for once step back
And gaze upon this world through my eyes

Time alone reveals our fatal aspect of arrogance
In life, we're not the only ones
Free from the walls, I'm alive
