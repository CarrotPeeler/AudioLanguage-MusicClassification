4 ContributorsPills Lyrics
I've taken all my pills, but I'm still not sleepy
Tried to trick myself into thinking
That I'm not awake, that it's only a dream
Put that cigarette out, don't ask me no questions


Salome dancing on my wall
And the shadows on the floor
Looks so warm from here, I've seen it all before
Just one little lie, but the difference is this
It meant the world to me, don't ask me no questions

"Take the wheel", she said, "As I wander"
"We could leave this town
Oh-ooh
I've got all I need
'Spirit, hope and joy', but no one knows me"


I think I lost my pills, guess I'll take my chances
I'm looking at the telephone, but nothing happens
I am well aware that the morning is near
Put that radio down, don't ask me no questions

No, no, no
No, no, no
No, no, no1Embed
