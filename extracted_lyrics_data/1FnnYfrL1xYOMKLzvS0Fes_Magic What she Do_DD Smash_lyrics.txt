3 ContributorsMagic (What She Do) LyricsOooo- oooh Wooohooo- yeah
She gave him a melody to sing; gave him a special flavour
She speaks in the languages of loving; he's an illiterate reader
She don't. Mince. Words
Gotta let love in sometime
We could make a great team
And with the scream of the limelight, learn to forget your failure
The heart of a practical dreamer; darling, he'll never fail ya
Pro-mi-ses
Of giving his soul intention
Promises a-plenty
And on, sing a severed song
Find each other's rhythms and we'll dance 'till we can't walk
'Cos it's magic what she do
Celebrate- yeah
'Cos it's magic what she do
Love, Don't think twice
And with a melody to sing, how could I feel a failure?
Hope is a heavenly spring, bouncing you back a favour
She don't. Mince. Words
You gotta let love in sometimes
We could make a real team
And on, sing a together song
Find a happy rhythm and we'll dance 'till we can't walk

Promises
'Cos it's magic what she do
Celebrate
'Cos it's magic what she do
Love, Don't mince words
Promises a-plenty
Yaaaah
Like that pendulum that swings
It's amazing what love brings
Little boy, Little girl
Play, To the rhythm of the world
Promises a-plenty
Little boy, Little girl
And magic, magic
Magic what she do
What she do
Magic
Yeaaaah
Promises a-plenty
