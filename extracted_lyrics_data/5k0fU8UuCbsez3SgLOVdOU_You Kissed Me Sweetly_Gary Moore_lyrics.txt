With the wind at my back
Dead, dead on my feet
But I've just got to make tracks
Straight, straight through your door
'Cause your love's got me trapped
Yes, your love's got me trapped
(You kissed me sweetly.)
Turn the lights down low. (you kissed me sweetly)
(You kissed me sweetly.)
Made me lose control. (you kissed me sweetly)
(You kissed me sweetly.)
Melt my heart like snow. (you kissed me sweetly)
Standing in your flame
I'll never be the same
Under your spell
I don't want to break free
In your arms I can tell
That your love hold's the key
The first time we kissed
You left me paralysed
That's when I realized
(You kissed me sweetly.)
Turn the lights down low. (you kissed me sweetly)
(You kissed me sweetly.)
Made me lose control. (you kissed me sweetly)
(You kissed me sweetly.)
Melt my heart like snow. (you kissed me sweetly)
Standing in your flame
I'll never be the same
You might also like(You kissed me sweetly.)
Turn the lights down low. (you kissed me sweetly)
(You kissed me sweetly.)
Made me lose control. (you kissed me sweetly)
(You kissed me sweetly.)
Melt my heart like snow. (you kissed me sweetly)
(You kissed me sweetly.)
Turn the lights, turn the lights down low. (you kissed me sweetly)
(You kissed me sweetly.)
You made me lose control. (you kissed me sweetly)
(You kissed me sweetly.)
Melt my heart, melt my heart, melt my heart like snow. (you kissed me sweetly)
(You kissed me sweetly.)
I'll never be the same. (you kissed me sweetly)
(You kissed me sweetly.)
I'll never be the same. (you kissed me sweetly)
(You kissed me sweetly.)
Darlin' I feel your flame, feel your flame, (you kissed me sweetly)
Feel your flame, yeah
Oh, oh noEmbed
