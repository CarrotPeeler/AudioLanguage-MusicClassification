1 ContributorPleasure Is Kisses Within LyricsWhen we laugh
Our soul's being tickled
By the past
When we weep
Our smiles "N" giggles
Secrets keep
Chorus
Pleasure is kisses within
Pleasure is kisses
Pleasure is kisses within
Pleasure is kisses
Who's in charge
Of the typhoons and the cyclones ?
Who makes the moon pull at the sea ?
When we cry
The sea becomes the ocean
I stand and grieve for reality
I know
I know
