6 ContributorsSummer Cannibals Lyrics
I was down in Georgia
Nothing was as real
As the street beneath a'my feet
Descending into air
The cauldron was a'bubbling
The flesh was lean
And the women moved forward
Like piranhas in a stream
They spread themselves before me
An offering so sweet
And they beckoned
Come on darling eat

Eat the summer cannibals
Eat eat eat
You eat the summer cannibals
Eat eat eat

They circled around me
Natives in a ring
And I saw their souls a'withering
Like snakes in chains
And they wrapped themselves around me
Ummm what a treat
And they rattled their tales
Hissing come on let's eat

I felt a rising in my throat
The girls a'saying  grace
And the air the vicious air
Pressed against my face
And it all got too damn much for me
Just got too damn rough
And I pushed away my plate
And said boys I've had enough
And I laid upon the table
Just another piece of meat
And I opened up my veins to them
And said come on eat


I was down in Georgia
Nothing was as real
As the street beneath a'my feet
Descending into hell
So eat eat eat
Eat eat eatEmbed
