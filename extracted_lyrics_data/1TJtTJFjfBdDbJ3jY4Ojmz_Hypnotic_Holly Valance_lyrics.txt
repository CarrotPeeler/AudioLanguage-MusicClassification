Baby come on over here
And taste me
Won't you feel my lips
And take me deeper into your arms
Mesmerising
Way you got my Venus rising
Visualising your skin melting into mine

Open up, I'm coming in
Explore original sin
Open up, I'm coming in
Lie back

It's getting so hypnotic
I'm coming up on it
Your love's hypnotic
It's a beautiful way to fly
Surrender your mind
And lose yourself as we rise
Hypnotic

Time is locked into the pulse inside us
In a place they'll never find us
Naked, sacred and pure
Heart's racing (Racing)
Rhythm so intoxicating (Cating)
Letting go and we're free falling
Going, going, gone
You might also like
Open up, I'm coming in
Explore original sin
Open up, I'm coming in
Lie back

It's getting so hypnotic (So hypnotic)
I'm coming up on it (Coming up on it)
Your love's hypnotic
It's a beautiful way to fly (To fly)
Surrender your mind
And lose yourself as we rise (As we rise)
Hypnotic

(Hmm)
Hypnotic, so hypnotic (Hmm)
Open up, I'm coming in
Open up, I'm coming in
So hypnotic
Coming up on it
So hypnotic

So hypnotic
I'm coming up on it
Your love's hypnotic
It's a beautiful way to fly
Surrender your mind
And lose yourself as we rise
Hypnotic
So hypnotic (So hypnotic)
I'm coming up on it (Coming up on it)
Your love's hypnotic
It's a beautiful way to fly (To fly)
Surrender your mind
And lose yourself as we rise (As we rise)
