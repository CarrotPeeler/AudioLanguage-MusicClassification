10 ContributorsTake It Or Leave It LyricsShe's got a knack for hurting me
Is it the words she says?
The only thing that keeps me here
Are her eyes in the morning
I've packed my things a thousand times, ooh
And I've faked believe all her lies, for the last time
The other day I drew myself a map
So I could figure out your head
The canvass dripped with my sweat, blood and tears
And she hated every thread
I've packed my things a thousand times, ooh
And I've faked believe all your lies, for the last time
Take it or leave it
Cause I'm really leaving
I've purchased my ticket to New York
First thing in the morning
Kissing you good morning
And whispering goodbye
Take it or leave it
Cause I'm really leaving
I've made up my mind this time
There's no coming back for you
Oh, there's no coming back for you

Than the knowledge in her head
She grabbed her shit just like a baby
I can't believe the words I said
The only thing I ever see her read
Are those damn gossip magazines
They fill her head with all that nonsense, yeah
So she can fit in with the scene
I've packed my things a thousand times, ooh
And I've faked believe all her lies, for the last time
Take it or leave it
Cause I'm really leaving
I've purchased my ticket to New York
First thing in the morning
Kissing you good morning
And whispering goodbye
Take it or leave it
Cause I'm really leaving
I've made up my mind this time
There's no coming back for you
Oh, there's no coming back for you
And I always feel incomplete
She smothered herself with her own beauty
And she was born and raised as daddy's princes
But her gesture is no match for an heiress
Yea her gesture is no match for an heiress
Cause I try to love you, try to hold on to
The feeling that makes me fall for you
Oh, the feeling that makes me fall...
Take it or leave it
Cause I'm really leaving
I've purchased my ticket to New York
First thing in the morning
Kissing you good morning
And whispering goodbye
Cause I try to love you, try to hold on to
The feeling that makes me fall for you
That makes me fall for you
Take it or leave it
Cause I'm really leaving
I've purchased my ticket to New York
First thing in the morning
Kissing you good morning
And whispering goodbye
Cause I try to love you, try to hold on to
The feeling that makes me fall for you
Oh, the feeling that makes me fall
Makes me fall for you6Embed
