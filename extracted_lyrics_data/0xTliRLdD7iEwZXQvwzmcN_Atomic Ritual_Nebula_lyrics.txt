1 ContributorThe Story of Space 1992: Rise of the Chaos Wizards LyricsInfernus Ad Astra
In the distant future of the year 1992 war has returned to the galaxy.
One thousand years have passed since the brave hero Angus McFife defeated the evil sorcerer Zargothrax in the battle of Dunfermline, trapping the wizard in a frozen prison of liquid ice. For centuries the valiant: Knights of Crail have guarded the immortal sorcerer's crystalline corpse, now locatеd in a hidden base on Triton, the
grеat moon of Neptune.
But now, in the year 1992, a cult of unholy chaos wizards are plotting to release their dark master from his ice-bound tomb and once again unleash the sorcerer Zargothrak upon the universe.
The tragic destiny of the Galactic Empire of Fife now hangs in the balance once more...Rise of the Chaos Wizards

Across the galaxy a new force of evil is rising
Wizards of chaos fight to control the brave king of Dundee
Entwined by mystic spells, to know where the sorcerer hidden
Imprisoned in ice on the planet of knights, the powerful heroes of Crail

Eons of warfare returning
No longer peace will survive
The intergalactic great Emperor of Fife will die
For the king we will ride
Through the dark galactic skies
To defeat the foes
When the chaos wizards rise
Now the universe will burn
Evil sorcerer returns
Tragic fate rages tonight
Chaos wizard rise

Sanctus dominus
Infernus ad astra

Infernus ad astra

Ten centuries ago brave heroes defeated the wizard
Now Chaos reigns and evil returns to the kingdom of Fife
Wizard cultists rage, on dark wings of steel they are flying
To space they must go, great terror they sow, nothing can stand in their way

The Spaceknights of Crail are defeated
The fortress of Triton is lost
Zargothrax rises once more from his prison of frost
For the king we will ride
Through the dark galactic skies
To defeat the foes
When the chaos wizards rise
Now the universe will burn
Evil sorcerer return
Tragic fate rages tonight
Chaos wizard rise

And lo, after centuries of frozen slumber, I am free once more
Cosmic infinity courses through my veins
My body is ablaze with astral terror
The galaxy shall once again tremble before the might of Zargothrax

Meanwhile, in the outer reaches of the solar system, a cold sun rose over the bleak shores of Triton. Rising from the mist. Ser Regulon, the only survivor of the Chaos Wizards' assault on the Space Knights of Crail, beheld the devestation surrounding him....

There was a time, when legends of Crail rang true
All over their majesty everyone knew
But now in the future, defeated by evil untold
We yearn for the knight from stories of old

A hero cannot be defeated simply by making him die
Proletius will rise, a hologram hero of light

Victorious eagle warfare
So glorious riding high up in the sky
Victorious eagle warfare
Brave warriors questing hard until they die
With nothing above but the heavens above
Guiding us on through the war
Eagle force

Inside the chamber of cryogenetical fire
A magical wizard is doing a spell
Powered by robots, a hologram coming to life
To stand at the side of the King of Fife

The galaxy knights are rising, reborn from the ashes of Crail
A force for the light to whom we eternally hail

Victorious eagle warfare
So glorious riding high up in the sky
Victorious eagle warfare
Brave warriors questing hard until they die
With nothing above but the heavens above
Guiding us on through the war

Mighty warriors of the Galaxy
You have proven yourselves to be mighty indeed
Now, who of you will join me in my SpaceKnights of Crail?


Victorious eagle warfare
So glorious riding high up in the sky

I wanna set the universe on fire
Feel it burn tonight
Set the universe on fire
There's no end in sight
Bring me to the holy raging power
Where I'll find my destiny
The universe on fire
You're my guiding light

Carrying the breath of fire within the lungs of steel
Soaring to light the flame forged by cosmic ordeal
Ascending the mighty dragon with metal wings and claw
In a great battle forego one thousand years ago

Now lead me to the stars
Atomic flame, ignite my heart

I wanna set the universe on fire
Feel it burn tonight

Gliding across the sun to soak up all its might
Charging my solar gun and prepare for epic fight
Questing through nebulas in search for crystal stone
That gives me the overdose of force to claim space throne

It is time, take up your arms
Nova bombs and plasma guns

I wanna set the universe on fire
Feel it burn tonight
Set the universe on fire

Bring me to the holy raging power

As word spread of the demon army invasion that was threatening Mars, mighty warriors of the entire galaxy began to assemble in preparation to fight for the power of cosmic justice. Crystalline darkness was falling upon the hearts of the assembled host. After a thousand years of peace, the intergalactic Space Empire of Fife was once again about to once again plunge into a bloody war, standing behind the banner of Angus McFife XIII. Riding his ancestral laserdragon, the brave prince of Dundee stood before his proud legions and raised the Hammer of Glory to the heavens.

Fly, on gigantic dragons made out of steel
Strike, with the Hammer of Glory, we will prevail
Kill, our cosmical enemies with full force
Blasting forth, without remorse
Rage, with bold supersonic velocity
Trust, in our lasers to storm 'cross the galaxy
Die, for the universe that we are fighting for
To win the war, forevermore

For Dunkeld and Cowdenbeath, an epic war is fight

We are heroes, heroes of Dundee
We are riding forth to free our galaxy
We are heroes, heroes of Dundee
We are heroes, legends we will be

Fear, our troll mass destruction artillery
Hear, our battle cry echoing through the sphere
Ride, on the back of the dragons, we're standing proud
Wrath unbound, we hold our ground

For Crail and for Aberdeen, an epic war is fight

We are heroes, heroes of Dundee
We are riding forth to free our galaxy
We are heroes, heroes of Dundee
We are heroes, legends we will be


We passed primordial black holes
Fought goblins and trolls on faraway stars together
We dashed through infinity for honour and glory
From Neptune to Mars to Mercury
To bring it all to an end, to make our final stand
In unity we rise, we will ascend
To realms we must protect
Mighty hammer connects
The force to annihilate Zargothrax

Yes, mighty warriors, in the name of cosmic justice we ride
Glory will prevail this day, hail to the King of Dundee

We are heroes, heroes of Dundee
We are riding forth to free our galaxy
We are heroes, heroes of Dundee
We are heroes, legends we will be
We are heroes, heroes of Dundee
Now the time has come that we'll make history
We are heroes, heroes of Dundee
We are heroes, legends we will beApocalypse 1992
And lo, led by the valiant hero Angus McFife XIII
The forces of justice assembled their armies in the skies above Mars
In preparation for the epic battle against the demon horde
But on planet Earth, a far more sinister machination was afoot
In the dwarven caverns beneath the mighty city of Dundee
The evil wizard Zargothrax began to recite the dread incantation
Which would unlock the chaos portal to the galactic nexus
As foretold in the dark prophecy of Anstruther countless centuries ago
As he placed the goblin king's crystal key into the altar before him
Ancient runes began to glow on the surface of the portal
Soon the gateway would open, and the Elder God Kor-Virliath of the 18th Hell Dimension would be unleashed unto the Galaxy
The countdown to universal annihilation had begun!

Warriors of planet earth
Hear my raging cry
For mighty Dundee
The demons will die

Yes battlecruisers
To space we will go
Discover new worlds
And conquer galaxies

Across the skies of Mars the demon war begins
Trust in your sword, this battle we'll win
The Space Knights of Crail are first to the fight
Clashing with lasers and power of might

Fly high through apocalypse skies
Fight for the world we must save
Like tears of a unicorn lost in the rain
Chaos will triumph this day
Apocalypse! 1992

At the speed of light
The dwarven king arrives
With crystal laser battle axe
Into the fray he rides

Pathetic dwarves
You are no match for my demon horde
Let battle commence!

It's the rage, the cosmic rage
The cosmic rage of astral Dwarves from Aberdeen
From their mines they will arise and fight
The rage of the Dwarves is tonight
It's the rage, the cosmic rage
The cosmic rage of astral Dwarves from Aberdeen
From their mines they will arise and fight
The rage of the Dwarves is tonight

De mortuis crepitus
Aberdonensis de furor infernus irae
Then they died


My ancestral demon army will ride the cosmic sphere
And liberate the multiverse from slavery and fear
With the power of the crystal from an ancient galaxy
The force of evil will prevail, it is my destiny!

The demon war raged on in the skies of Mars
As wave after wave of undead foe charged into the dwindling ranks of the forces of justice
The Dwarven King of Aberdeen was dead
His armies slaughtered by a robotic space goblin
The Questlords of Inverness had fallen too
Obliterated by an infinity bomb which erased their existence from all of history
The Knights of Crail were once again defeated by the chaos wizard Tharon-Zul
While making a noble defense of the moon Phobos
Now only Angus McFife XIII and The Hootsman survived
Preparing to make a final stand against the massed ranks of evil
Meanwhile on planet earth, in the caverns beneath Dundee
A mysterious figure watched from the shadows
As the evil sorcerer Zargothrax prepared to summon an evil being of unimaginable terror into the galaxy...

From the caves beneath Dundee
Ancient hermit arise!
A messenger to the war in the stars
Kor-Virliath is nigh!

The mysterious figure was none other than Ralathor, the Hermit of Cowdenbeath!
He realised that if Zargothrax would succeed in opening the chaos portal
Kor-Virliath would devour not just all of planet earth, but the entire galaxy
The demon war of Mars had just been a diversion!
With great haste, the mysterious hermit took flight
And set off into the midst of the raging battle in space
To warn Angus McFife XIII and The Hootsman of what was about to unfold

Hootsman: Hoots! Ralathor arrives, to tell a dread tale... the fate of the galaxy hangs in the balance. Hell gods of the galactic nexus seek ot annihilate the Space Empire of Fife!
Ralathor: The summoning ritual is protected by a mysterious extra-galactic crystal key, which seems to be goblonic in origin. Only the blast of a Neutronic Transnova Bomb has the power to penetrate the sorveruos forcefields
Angus McFife XIII: By all the gods of Dundee! Such a powerful explosion would have dread consequences... the planet will be destroyed, and the fabric of space-time may even collapse!
Hootsman: And yet it must be done. Fear not, Angus. I will undertake the grim task

Deep inside the Hootsman, there lies a secret heart
The barbarian is a cyborg powered by a neutron star
For millenia this immortal hero quested time and space
But now he must make sacrifice to save the human race
The only way to save the galaxy
Is to destroy planet earth and all Dundee
It is time... it is time!
My ascendancy is Nigh!
Soon the incantation will be complete and I will devour this insignificant galaxy!

Faster than a laser bullet
Hoostman flies to Fife
He detonates his nuclear heart
Destroys all human life

Nyaaaahhhhhhh!!

Fly high through apocalypse skies
Fight for the world we must save
Like tears of a unicorn lost in the rain
Chaos will triumph this day
Fly high through apocalypse skies
Fight for the world we must save
Like tears of a unicorn lost in the rain
Chaos will triumph this day
Apocalypse

With a thunderous explosion of ultragravitational terrorflux
The Barbarian Warrior of Unst vaporised the Earth with the Neutronic Transnova Bomb detonation of his robotic powersource
The summoning ritual of Kor-Virliath and the crystal key of the Goblin King had been destroyed
But at great cost
Cosmic infinity crackled around the black space in the heavens
As suddenly the fabric of reality began to tear Quantum lightning exploded from the nothingness
Exposing a dimensional rift in the sky
Yet the immortal sorcerer Zargothrax still was not annihilated

No! You impudent mortal scum!
One thousand years of planning... ruined by a Hootsman!
I swear I will have my revenge
In this space-time continuum or the next!

Channeling his last shards of power
Zargothrax plunged himself through the amorphous portal in space
Vanishing from this universe into another reality
Nobody could know when or where the wormhole might lead to...
Yet Angus McFife XIII swore that at any cost, he must find and defeat Zargothrax
No matter where he may be
And so with a final raging battle cry
He followed the dark sorcerer into the dimensional rift
For the eternal glory of Dundee
