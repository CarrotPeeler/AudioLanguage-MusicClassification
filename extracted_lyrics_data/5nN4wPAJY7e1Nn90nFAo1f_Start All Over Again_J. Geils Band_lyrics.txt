You hung me up once, baby
It can't happen no more
I'm gonna start all over
Over again, all over again
You gave me love, I took a kiss
Sweet rose, things that I miss
You made me lonely once before
I can't be lonely anymore
Over again, all over again
When it gets you down, baby
Slide away
She's slippin' on you, man
And you know you just can't stay
I've been through these times before
I'll be through these times some more
And if I don't find a way
It's the price I have to pay
I'm gonna start all over
Over again, all over again
I've been through these times before
I'll be through these times some more
And if I don't find a way
It's the price I have to pay
I'm gonna start all over again
Baby, start all over again
Baby, start all over again
Over again
You might also likeI'm gonna start all over again
Baby, start all over again
I'm gonna start all over again
Baby, start all over again
I lost love once, lost love twice
I can't be lonely any more nights
Give it to me
(Start all over)
(Start all over)
Say it one more time, baby
(Start all over)
I gotta start all over, baby
(Start all over)
Oh yeah
You know I gotta have one more time
(Start all over)
Start all over
(Start all over)
(Start all over)
Oh yeah, I gotta start all over
(Start all over)
You know, I took your kiss one too many times
(Start all over)
And all the things I've missed from you, babyEmbed
