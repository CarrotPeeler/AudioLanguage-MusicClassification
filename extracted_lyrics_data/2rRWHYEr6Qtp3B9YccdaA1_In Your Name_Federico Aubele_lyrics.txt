There was a man, a little ole man, who lived in Montreal
With a wife and a kid, and a car and a house
And a teenage daughter, with a see-thru blouse
Who loved to grunt and ball, and her name was Magdalena
The little ole man came home one night
To his house in Montreal
He caught his daughter in the blouse by the light
And he said to himself: "she looks all right!"
And he reached for a tit and grabbed it tight
And threw her up against the wall, blue cross!
Magdalena, my daughter dear do not be concerned
When your Canadian daddy comes near
My daughter dear do not be concerned
When your Canadian daddy comes near
I work so hard don't you understand
Making maple syrup for the pancakes of our land
Do you have any idea what that can do to a man?
What that can do to a man?
Do you have any idea what that can do to a man?
What that can do to a man?

Who lived in Montreal
Was drooling a bit as he reached for her tit
And he said to himself: "this gonna be it!"
But the girl turned around and said: "go eat shit!"
And ran on down the hall, right on, Magdalena!
My daughter dear do not be concerned
When your Canadian daddy comes near
My daughter dear do not be concerned
When your Canadian daddy comes near
I work so hard don't you understand
Making maple syrup for the pancakes of our land
Do you have any idea what that can do to a man?
What that can do to a man?
Do you have any idea? what that can do to a man?
What that can do to a man?
Magdalena, don't you tease me like this
Right in the hallway with your blouse and your tits
If your mommy ever finds us like this
She'll call a lawyer, oh how mom will be pissed
Doodle, doodle, doodle, duh-duh, dee-uh
Doodle, doodle, doodle, duh-duh, dee-uh
Doodle, doodle, doodle, duh-duh, dee-uh
Doodle, doodle, doodle, duh-duh, dee-uh-ahh
Magdalena, Magdalena, Magdalena, Magdalena
Daughter of the smog-filled winds of Los Angeles
I'd like to take you in the closet
And take off your little clothes
Until you're virtually stark raving nude
Spread mayonnaise and Kaopectate all over your body
And take you down to Hollywood Boulevard
And we can, we can walk down the streets
By the stars that say John Provost
And Leo G. Carrol together, baby
We can go dancing up at the Cina Grill ... can't you see it: Frank Pernell and us, until dark ... don't you understand, my Baby ... I didn't mean, I didn't need, I mean ... it was so hard for me ...
