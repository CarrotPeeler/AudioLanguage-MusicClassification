My little baby
Oh, little baby

Baby
I know I told you
A million or more times that I
I love you so

Baby
I want to be sure
You know that I need you, and I
I'll never let you go

Oh, little baby
My little baby

Baby
If you should want me
I'll come when you call me
Yes, I'll be around
You might also like
Baby
Don't ever worry
As long as you need me, you know
I'll never let you down

I want to be with you
Till the day I die
Your love will see me through
That's the reason why, why

Baby
I want to hold you
So close to my heart that you
You can hear me say

Baby
Tell me you love me
And make me a promise that you
You'll never go away

Oh, little baby
My little baby
Oh, little baby
Oh, little baby (My little baby)
Oh, little baby (My little baby)
Oh, little baby (My little baby)Embed
