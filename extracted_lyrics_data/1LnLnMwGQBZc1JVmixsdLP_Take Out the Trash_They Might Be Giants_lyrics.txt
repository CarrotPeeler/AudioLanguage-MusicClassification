Girl, why not take out the trash
And once you get him out, tell him not to come back again
Girl, put that cad in the bin
After what he said, after everything he did

You had him figured out a while ago
And I know it's not exactly breaking news
But it's all been a little like a trial for you
And a bunch more talking won't make him true

Ah, come on, girl, why not take out the trash
And once you get him out, tell him not to come back again
Girl, why not give him the slip?
Get the crooked straight, get the go-getter good and gone

Why, when it's so plain that he's just making it up
And he's still got you coming back for more
Why you never, ever think of breakin' it up
Tell me, what bad deal's gonna close that door?

Ah, come on, girl, why not take out the trash
And once you get him out, tell him not to come back again
Girl, why not give him the slip?
Get the crooked straight, get the go-getter good and gone

I'm not saying all the boys are the same
But some boys are the same, and it's Thursday now
I'm not saying all the boys are the same
But some boys are the same, and it's Thursday now
I'm not saying all the boys are the same
But some boys are the same, and it's Thursday now

Girl, why not take out the trash
And once you get him out, tell him not to come back again
Girl, put that cad in the bin
After what he said, after everything he did
Girl, why not take out the trash?
Girl, why not take out the trash?
Girl, why not take out the trash
And once you get him out, tell him not to come back again
Girl, why not give him the slip?
Get the crooked straight, get the go-getter good and goneEmbed
