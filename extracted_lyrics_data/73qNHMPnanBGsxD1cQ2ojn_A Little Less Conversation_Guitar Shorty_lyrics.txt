1 ContributorA Little Less Conversation LyricsCome on baby, I'm tired of talking
Grab your coat and let's start the walking
A little less conversation, a little more action
Aggravation ain't no satisfaction
Little more bite, little less bark, little less fight, little more spark
Baby open up your heart and satisfy me
Come on baby I'm tired of talking, grab your coat, let's start the walking
Close your eyes and listen to the music on a summer breeze
It's a summer night, can I show you how to use it?
Baby put your mind at ease
A little less conversation, little more action
All at aggravation, ain't no satisfaction
Little more bite, little less bark, little less fight, little more spark
Baby open up your heart and satisfy me

Come on baby, I'm tired of talking
Grab your coat and let's start the walking, I'm tired of talking, baby
A little less conversation, little more action
All at aggravation, ain't no satisfaction
Little more bite, little less bark, little less fight, little more spark
Baby open up your heart and satisfy me, satisfy me
You might also likeCome on baby, slow and easy
Feelin' so good
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, satisfy me
If it burn me night baby
Come on
Come on, baby, I'm tired of talkingEmbed
