Something inside
Starts to burning
And I'm filled with desire
Could it be a devil in me
Or is this the way love's supposed to be
It's like a heat wave
Burning in my heart
Can't keep from crying
It's tearing me apart
Whenever he calls my name
Soft, low, sweet and plain
I feel, yeah, yeah
Well, I feel that burning flame
Has high blood pressure got a hold on me
Or is this the way love's supposed to be
It's like a heat wave
Burning in my heart
Can't keep from crying
It's tearing me apart
You might also likeSometimes I stare into space
Tears all over my face
I can't explain it, don't understand it
I hadn't ever felt like this before
Now that funny feeling has me amazed
I don't know what to do, my head's in a haze
It's like a heat wave
Burning in my heart
Can't keep from crying
It's tearing me apart
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah oh oh (heat wave)
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Oh (heat wave)
(Don't pass up this chance)
(This time it's true romance)
(Heat wave)
(Heat wave)
(Heat wave)
Ooh (heat wave)Embed
