He wanted to be
Near to me
He said he never wanted to be
Out of my sight
But it's too late to give
This boy my love
Tonight
Please wait at the gate
Of heaven for me
Terry
He said to me
He wanted to be
Close by my side
We had a quarrel
I was untrue
On the night he died
And it's too late to tell
This boy how great was
Please wait at the gate
Of heaven for me
Terry
He rode into the night
Accelerated his motorbike
I cried to him in fright
Don't do it, don't do it, don't do it
You might also likeHe said to me
You are the one
I want to be with
He said to me
You are the one
Who my love
I shall give
One day he'll know
How hard I prayed for him
To live
Please wait at the gate
Of heaven for me
Terry
He rode into the night
Accelerated his motorbike
I cried to him in fright
Don't do it, don't do it, don't do itEmbed
