I know the tale
I know the type
I know the sale
I know the spell
Ever
Is it nice?
Never
Is it nice?
Ever
That you won't be complete
No, never
Since you can not compete
Generation excess

I know the glimpse
I know the set
I know the climb
I know the shell

That you won't be complete
No, never
Since you can not compete
Ever
No, never
Forever in a vacuum
Built to make you happy
Feelings made to medicate
Joy for allEmbed
