1 ContributorTwist of the Knife LyricsIt's a shame when you got me where you want me but you want me somewhere else
And it's a shame the way you take my love and baby on and off the shelf
It's a shame, shame, shame
The way you run my life
But you always insist on another little twist of the knife
Tell me how many times can I belive you when you're out with your best friend
When you don't even care if the whole town sees you out with another man
It's a shame, shame, shame
The way you run my life
But you always insist on another little twist of the knife
Your lips I can't resist
Your eyes they hypnotize
With an endless supply of bullets to bite
So every day I can take another little twist of the knife
Your lips I can't resist
Your eyes they hypnotize
With an endless supply of bullets to bite
So every day I can take another little twist of the knife
Well a man takes an ounce of dignity and a pound of foolish pride
And he gives it up for a woman like you to keep her satisfied
It's a shame, shame, shame
The way you run my life
But you always insist on another little twist of the knife
You might also likeBaby it's a shame, shame, shame
The way you run my life
But you always insist on another little twist of the knife
It's a shame
It's a shame, shame, shame
It's a shame
It's a shame, shame, shame, shame, shame
Oh baby don't do me like thatEmbed
