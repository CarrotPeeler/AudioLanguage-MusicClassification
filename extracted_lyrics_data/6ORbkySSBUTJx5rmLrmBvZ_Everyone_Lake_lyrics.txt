Lakes

'Cause lakes are fun
'Cause lakes are fun
'Cause lakes are fun
'Cause lakes are fun
'Cause lakes are fun
'Cause lakes are fun

See, my lake is the only one
Made of water rippling in the sun

'Cause lakes are fun
'Cause lakes are fun
'Cause lakes are fun
'Cause lakes are fun
'Cause lakes are fun
'Cause lakes are fun
