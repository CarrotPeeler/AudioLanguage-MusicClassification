2 ContributorsStanding Lyrics
Eyes betray the soul and bear its thinking
Beyond words, they say so many things to me
A stranger here, reborn, it seems
Awaking wonders deep in me
If nothing's ventured, nothing's gained
So I must seize the day

And fighting time so hard, I pray
That this moment lasts forever
And will the world stay standing still
At least for me?
Through my eyes, stare into me
I bear my heart for all to see
With my face turned to the sun
There ever standing still

It wasn't you, it wasn't me, it wasn't anything
It was a day so long awaited and a chance to be as me
I let the wind run through my hands
Before I turned to walk away
In distant days, I long to sense it all so clear

And fighting time so hard, I pray
That this moment lasts forever
And will the world stay standing still
At least for me?
Through my eyes, stare into me
I bear my heart for all to see
With my face turned to the sun
There ever standing still
And fighting time so much, I ask
I will this moment last forever
Though seasons change, things come to pass
Remain inside of me
And fighting time so hard, I pray
That this moment lasts forever
And will the world stay standing still
At least for me?

I had no faith before that time
In any vow or deed
Days followed days
And years were meaningless
Despite the wisdom of defeat
I bore my heart for all to see
The wonders I'd seen
The wonders I'd seen

And fighting time so hard, I pray
That this moment lasts forever
And will the world stay standing still
At least for me?
Through my eyes, stare into me
I bear my heart for all to see
With my face turned to the sun
There ever standing still
And fighting time so much, I ask
I will this moment last forever
Though seasons change, things come to pass
Remain inside of me
And fighting time so hard, I pray
That this moment lasts forever
And will the world stay standing still
At least for me?Embed
