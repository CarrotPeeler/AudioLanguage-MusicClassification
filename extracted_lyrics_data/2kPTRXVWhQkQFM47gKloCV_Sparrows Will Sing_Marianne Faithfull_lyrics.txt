4 ContributorsSparrows Will Sing LyricsA child breaks the ice and peers into the hidden depths
And tries to decipher the whole of this unholy mess
I have no doubt he will figure it out some day
Callooh, Callooh Callay
Then the sparrows will sing on the boulevards again
And the corridors of power will be walked by thoughtful men
The assassins and priests like mythical beasts will surely fade away
Callooh, Callooh Callay
Callooh, Callooh Callay
The new generation is eager to master the helm
They cannot be seduced by this candyfloss techno hell
They put over the helm and a fresh breeze fills the sails
Callooh, Callooh Callay
Callooh, Callooh Callay
A child breaks the ice and peers into the hidden depths
To try to untangle the whole of this unholy mess
Well I have no doubt they will figure it out one day
Callooh, Callooh Callay
Callooh, Callooh Callay
