2 ContributorsSomeone Else LyricsYeah yeah yeah yeah
She drinks the blood of the dinosaurs to get her powers back
To make her boyfriend understand
That things are not what they used to be
She doesnt have a plan
To make her boyfriend understand
Through the gates of insanity
On the edge of humanity
She's gonna make her dreams come true
Through the gates of insanity
On the edge of humanity
She's gonna make her dreams come true
That she belongs to someone else
That she belongs to someone else
Yeah yeah yeah
To somebody else
To someone else
To somebody else
She's found something to die for
Something to fight for
Someone to show her the way
She's found someone to cry for
Someone to lie for
Heart full of blood of the dinosaurs

Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
To somebody else
To someone else
To somebody else
To someone else
To somebody else
To somebody else
To somebody else
