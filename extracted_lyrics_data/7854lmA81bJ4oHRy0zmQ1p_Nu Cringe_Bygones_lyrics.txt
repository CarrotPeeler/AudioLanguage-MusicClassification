You got nu cringe
I got nu 
You got nu cringe

It was just the
Truth (I just want) it (I just want) just was
There goes the only child of insanity
Even if you knew what I was
You couldn't find me
When I can't remember you, don't remind me
Now is gone but still () want () shut on
There goes the only child of insanity
Even if you knew what I was
You couldn't find me
When I can't remember this, don't remind me
I got nu 
I got nu cringe
I got nu 
You got nu cringe

Trapped in a tantrum
