10 ContributorsPraise the Lord (Opium of the Masses) LyricsOne by one, the young will fall, indoctrinating process growing
Some too weak to fight at all, who controls their future?
God above, or God below, questions that no one can answer
Live the truth, or die to know, it's my agnostic vision
Jews killing Muslims, and Christians killing Jews
The circle is unending, and all sides always lose
If faith is blind devotion, then death is the result
When history is rotten, the young and pure grow dead and cold
I don't need a book for saving, fellowship or days of praying
Organizing means dilution, and results in persecution
Through it all I keep a vision, understand what I believe in
Truth is not the faith you follow, it's far more than you can ever know
Religion, the burden we carry forth
Mankind, addicted--the drug spreads on
Paranoia eats all reason, driving their crusading mission
Zealotry from Rome to Mecca, millions more become infected
God cannot be mass-projected, or beaten out through forced confessions
It's for all of us to ponder, not for dogma's chains to hold us down
Wake up and put the past where it belongs, just beat them back till they are gone
Their doctrines lead to misery, they're prophets preaching fantasy
How can they hold themselves above the rest?
From holy birth to martyr's death, the moral quest for life beyond, It's just a pipe dream for the paranoid
The empty words of holy books will mislead all those that read
Buried in the lines of text are the myths that feed their needs

Which came from a life form we can never know
Pray for a world that only God above can save?
The church is the reason why they've lost their way
Crusades and Inquisitions, holy wars, Jihad
They are the willing victims of a grand facade
Above it all, the lies are told. The masses follow without question
First to die, or last to go, I know my convictions
Flesh and blood, and spirit life, the trinity of my perception
Dead awake, or sleeping dead, we will find out in the endEmbed
