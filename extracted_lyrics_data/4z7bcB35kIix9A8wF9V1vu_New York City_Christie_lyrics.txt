2 ContributorsNew York City LyricsThrough the night I gambled
I played a real cool hand
People still remember
They say "There goes that man"
"Who always found four aces"
Lady luck was mine
'Cos I fought and won life's battles
And I made it just in time
"Come on make up the number"
That's all they had to say
"We'll take him for a ride"
It made me wanna stay
Well I taught them a lesson
To stop them foolin' round
The crowd, they really gathered
To see me break 'em down
New York city, she's a friend of mine
New York city, she's a friend of mine
People think I cheat and lie
But I don't really care
'Cos in New York city now
People never stare
Well I taught them a lesson
To stop them foolin' round
The crowd, they really gathered
To see me break 'em down

New York city, she's a friend of mine
People think I cheat and lie
But I don't really care
'Cos in New York city now
People never stareEmbed
