Cigarette holder, which wigs me
Over his shoulder, he digs me
Out cattin', that satin doll
Baby, shall we go out steppin'?
Careful, amigo, you're flippin'
Speaks Latin, that satin doll

He's nobody's fool, so I'm playing it cool as can be
I'll give it a whirl but I ain't for no boy catchin' me
Switch-a-rooney

Telephone numbers, well, you know
Doin' my rhumbas with uno
And that'n my satin doll


Telephone numbers, well, you know
Doin' my rhumbas with uno
And that'n my satin doll

And that'n my satin doll
And that'n my satin dollYou might also likeEmbed
