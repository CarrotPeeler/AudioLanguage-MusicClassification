4 ContributorsLeaving on a Jet Plane Lyrics
All my bags are packed and I'm ready to go
I'm standing here outside the door
I hate to wake you up to say goodbye
But the dawn is breaking, it's early morn'
Taxi's waiting, he's blowing his horn
Already I'm so lonesome I could die

So kiss me and smile for me
Tell me that you'll wait for me
Hold me like you'll never let me go
'Cause I'm leaving on a jet plane
Don't know when I'll be back again
Oh babe, I hate to go

So many times I've let you down
There's so many times I fucked around
I tell you now, they don't mean a thing
'Cause every place I go, I'll think of you
Every song I sing, I'll sing for you
When I come back I'll bring your wedding ring

So kiss me and smile for me
Tell me that you'll wait for me
Hold me like you'll never let me go
'Cause I'm leaving on a jet plane
Don't know when I'll be back again
Oh babe, I hate to go
You might also like
Now the time has come to leave you
One more time to let me kiss you
Close your eyes and I'll be on my way
Dream about the days to come
When I won't have to leave alone
About the times that I won't have to say

Oh, kiss me and smile for me
Tell me that you'll wait for me
Hold me like you'll never let me, never let me go
'Cause I'm leaving on a jet plane
Don't know when I'll be back again
Oh babe, I hate to goEmbed
