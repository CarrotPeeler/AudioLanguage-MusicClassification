7 ContributorsSheâ€™s Leaving You Lyrics
You were planning to stay in, you had it carefully planned
Your coat was hanging in the hall, your hat was in your hand
You walked over to your woman, your pale distracted love
Who was trying to put the wrong hand into the wrong glove

Are you leaving, dear? Are you leaving, dear?
Are you leaving, dear? Are you leaving, dear?
Are you leaving, dear?
(Are you leaving me behind?)
Are you leaving, dear?
(Leaving one kiss at a time)

So you start reading all her books, all her magazines
Just to get a better understanding
Your brain feels like it's dead
Your eyes are hanging out your head
You were hoping for something less demanding
Well what you see staring out at you from a photo book
A man with an eye-patch and a bent and bloody hook
You wished to God that you never went and took a look
Cause it's in that moment that you know

That she's leaving you
(she's leaving you behind)
Yeah she's leaving you
(she's leaving one kiss at a time)

Well now she's taking you to bed
Her legs wrapped round your head
You're losing her to some crazy kind of motion
You keep coming up for air
You look around and stare
Find you're swimming in two completely different oceans
You're wondering if she's thinking about some other man
She says, "C'mon, baby, you know you are my loverman"
You're going nuts you don't know exactly what to say
She says, "Don't worry, baby, this is just my little way

Of leaving you"
(she's leaving you behind)
Oh, man, she's leaving you
(she's leaving one kiss at a time)


She keeps saying, "Hey, don't hate me"
She keeps saying, "Hate is just some kind of failure of the imagination"
She keeps saying things like this
Now she's giving you a kiss
Now she's got you driving her to the station
The sun just slipped out of the sky, this is a black letter day
Her train is moving down the platform, and is drawn away
You're crying buckets, she gives her glove a wave
She says "Oh c'mon, baby, that's no way to behave
When I'm leaving you"
(she's leaving you behind)
Oh yeah, she's leaving you
(she's leaving one kiss at a time)
Oh yeah, she's leaving you
(she's leaving you behind)
Yeah, she's leaving you
(she's leaving one kiss at a time)
She's leaving you
(she's leaving you behind)
Yeah, she's leaving you
(she's leaving you behind)
Yeah, she's leaving you
(she's leaving you behind)
Yeah, she's leaving you
She's leaving one kiss at a time2Embed
