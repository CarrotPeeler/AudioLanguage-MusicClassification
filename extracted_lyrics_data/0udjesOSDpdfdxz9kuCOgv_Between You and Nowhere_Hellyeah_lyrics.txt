6 ContributorsBetween You and Nowhere Lyrics
I can't remember, the day we died!
My last memory, we were just tryin' to survive
Ain't what it used to be, no I've grown cold
Like watching the sun go to bed at the end of a lonely road
I walked a life right by your side but you couldn't touch me
I kept my heart up on the top shelf just out of your reach

Somewhere between you and nowhere
Is where I always seem to be
Somewhere between starlight and darkness
Is where my life's taking me
Under ashes is where my life's left me

I can't remember, the day I died
The tangled web I weave, is not a truth or a lie
I tried so hard, but I'm too scarred to let you close to me
I'm all smoking mirrors, light of hand
I keep my heart up my sleeve

Somewhere between you and nowhere
Is where I always seem to be
Somewhere between starlight and darkness
Is where my life's taking me
Under ashes, where my life left me
You might also like
I can't help the way I am
I'm the smoke you just can't grab
I was conditioned I wasn't told
I'm like a light you see, but can't never hold
Darling I'm so sorry, for me
Goodbye, I'm so sorry

Somewhere between you and nowhere
Is where I always seem to be
Somewhere between starlight and Darkness
Is where my life's taking me
Under ashes is where my life's left me
Under ashes is all that's left of meEmbed
