I remember 'cause I think you're pretty
You shine brighter, baby, in my heart
Than all bright lights in this New York city
All the bright lights in New York
Last time that I saw you it was dark
I remember that you don't believe me
Take my seat and wait for it to start
Let the lights fade out beneath me
The bright lights of New York
And I see it all
And I see it all
I see this postcard on the wall
And I see it all
One last look into your eyes
The day had only just begun, yeah
With the gentle bruising in the skies
By the sun, yeah, by the sun
And I see it all
And I see it all
I see this postcard on the wall
And I see it all

To the bright lights in New York
One day closer than before
Bright lights in New York
Bright lights in New York
To the bright lights of New York
