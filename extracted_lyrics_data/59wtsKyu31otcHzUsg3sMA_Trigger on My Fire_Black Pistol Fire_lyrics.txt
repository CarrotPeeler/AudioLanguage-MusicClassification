2 ContributorsTrigger On My FIre LyricsHow long did it took to give up?
How long when you cannot wait?
How long did it took to give up?
How long when you cannot wait?
Comin', keep 'em comin'
They didn't know
What you give that fuels my fire
Comin', keep 'em comin'
They didn't know
What you give that fuels my fire
You were running straight through my head
You were running around like a lunatic
You were running straight through my head
You were running around like a lunatic
Wind down, on your knees
You gonna break it, I can see
Wind down, on your knees
You gonna break it, I can see
Back to where we must go
You won't see me fall
Back to where we must go
You always come in cold

I'm not sure if I really could
Shot down in a thinner wall
I'm not sure if I really could
I'll put a triggеr on my fire
I'm not sure if ready is I
I'll put a triggеr on my fire
Been singing like a famous child
Not sure if I really could
I guess you'll never know
You waited around for so long
You waited and now it seems
You waited around for so long
You waited and now it seems
Wind down, on your knees
You gonna break it, I can see
Wind down, on your knees
You gonna break it, I can see
Back to where we must go
You won't see me fall
Back to where we must go
You always come in cold
Shot down in a thinner wall
I'm not sure if I really could
Shot down in a thinner wall
I'm not sure if I really could
I'll put a trigger on my fire
I'm not sure if ready is I
I'll put a trigger on my fire
Been singing like a famous child
Not sure if I really could
I guess you'll never know
I won't be alone
I won't be alone
I will be alone
I will be alone
Now that you want me to
Shot down in a thinner wall
I'm not sure if I really could
Shot down in a thinner wall
I'm not sure if I really could
I'll put a trigger on my fire
I'm sure if ready is I
I'll put a trigger on my fire
Been singing like a famous childEmbed
