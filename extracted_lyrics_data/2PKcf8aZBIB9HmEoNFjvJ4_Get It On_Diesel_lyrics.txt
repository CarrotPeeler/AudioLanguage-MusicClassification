2 ContributorsGet It On LyricsYeah, yeah
Well, I've been feeling pretty bad
Since I left my baby's home
'Cause she was looking pretty good
When I left her all alone
Now I got to wait more than a minute
Before I'm stepping 'cross her lawn
And you I just didn't get the time
To get it, get it on
Get it on, get it on
Get it on, oh, yeah, get it on
Now she was standing at the door
When I left her in the morn
And you know the look she gave to me
Well, my heart right there was torn
Now I got to wait more than a minute
Before I'm stepping 'cross her lawn
And you I just didn't get the time
To get it, get it on
Get it on, get it on
Get it on, oh, yeah, get it on
Get it on, get it on, whoo!
Get it on, get it on, yeah, yeah

Gonna steal some time, yeah
Gonna take you real slow
And I won't let go
I won't let go, yeah, yeah, yeah
Get it on, get it on
Get it on, get it on, oh, yeah
Get it on, get it on, ooh...
Get it on, get it on, yeah, yeah
Get it on, get it on
(I'm stealing time, I'm stealing time)
Get it on, oh, yeah, get it on, ah!
Get it on, ooh, get it on, ooh-ooh
(I'm stealing time, I'm stealing time)
Get it on, yeah, get it on
Well, I've been feeling pretty bad
Since I left my baby's homeEmbed
