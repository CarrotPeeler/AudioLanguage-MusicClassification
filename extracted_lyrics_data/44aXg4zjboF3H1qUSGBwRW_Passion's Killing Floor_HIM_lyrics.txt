6 ContributorsPassionâ€™s Killing Floor Lyrics
It's poetry carved in flesh
This beautiful hell of ours
To the deadliest sin we confess
And tears of joy fill our eyes

We are safe where disfigured saints
Cry out their prophecies of doom

My heart's a graveyard, baby
And to evil, we make love
On our passion's killing floor
In my arms, you won't sleep safely
And of lust, we are reborn
On our passion's killing floor

At the first kiss, the seeds
Of hatred are sown
And back into darkness, we flee
To tear our hearts out

We are safe where all faiths fail
Alive inside of our tomb
You might also like
My heart's a graveyard, baby
And to evil, we make love
On our passion's killing floor
In my arms, you won't sleep safely
And of lust, we are reborn
On our passion's killing floor

(Pulses unchecked
Everyone already is dead
All we know has been crucifered)

My heart's a graveyard, baby
And to evil, we make love
On our passion's killing floor
In my arms, you won't sleep safely
And of lust, we are reborn
On our passion's killing floor

(My heart's a graveyard, baby)
Oh, my heart's a graveyard, baby
On our passion's killing floor
(In my arms, you won't sleep safely)
And to evil, we make love
On our passion's killing floor
Forevermore... that's rightEmbed
