4 ContributorsIf Thereâ€™s a Heaven Lyrics
When you go, you let me know if there's a Heaven out there
When you leave me here to grieve in pain and despair
I've seen the face of Hell, I know that place pretty damn well
But when you go, you'll let me know if there's a Heaven out there
One day you'll fly away far beyond the blue
When you're done and your run is finally through
I'm forced to let go, there'll be no greater sorrow
One day you'll fly away far beyond the blue
I'll be lost when you cross over to the other side
My pain would be in vain if I found out they lied
When you go, I need to know if what they say is really so
'Cause I'll be lost when you cross over to the other side
Will you promise me this before you let go of my hand
Before we visit our last kiss and you are cold and cannot stand
Before it's finally time and you've taken my sunshine
Will you promise me this before you let go of my hand

When you go, you let me know if there's a Heaven out there
When you leave me here to grieve in pain and despair
I've seen the face of Hell, I know that place pretty damn well
But when you go, you'll let me know if there's a Heaven out there
