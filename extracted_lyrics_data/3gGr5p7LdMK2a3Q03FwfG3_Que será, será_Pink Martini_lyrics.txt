3 ContributorsQue Sera Sera LyricsWhen I was just a little girl
I asked my mother, "What will I be?
Will I be pretty? Will I be rich?"
Here's what she said to me

"Que sera sera
Whatever will be will be
The future's not ours to see
Que sera sera"
When I was just a child in school
I asked my teacher, "What should I try?
Should I paint pictures? Should I sing songs?"
This was her wise reply

"Que sera sera
Whatever will be will be
The future's not ours to see
Que sera sera"
When I grew up and fell in love
I asked my sweetheart, "What lies ahead?
Will there be rainbows day after day?"
Here's what my sweetheart said

Que sera sera
Whatever will be will be
The future's not ours to see

Whatever will be will be
