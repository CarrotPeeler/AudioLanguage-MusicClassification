9 ContributorsNostalgic Feel Lyrics
Blue skies and green fields
I'm thinking of the older years
If I had the chance to relive those days
I'd take it, and I'd run away for good
Nostalgia is what I feel
It's vibrant, and it is very real

Sitting in an open room
Thinking of how much I miss you
I know the future is looking good
But I would still love to go back if only I could
Nostalgia keeps haunting me
With all of those sweet colored memoriesYou might also like1Embed
