I believe in love
I believe in magic
But this is not enough
I believe in freedom
I believe in dreams
I believe in heroes
But this is not enough
I believe in faith
In all a child can learn
I believe all what you give
You get returned
But I'm afraid we place our life
In other people's hands
I realize on Earth we're all the same
We need a chance
I believe in visions
I believe in love
I believe in magic
But this is not enough (this is not enough)
I believe in visions (I believe)

More than wrong or right
I believe in colors there's
No black or white
And you don't know
What you have got until you say goodbye
But in my dreams one day
I spread my wings and I will fly
I believe in visions
I believe in love
I believe in magic
But this is not enough
I believe in freedom (Oh I believe, Oh!)
I believe in dreams (I believe, Oh!)
I believe in heroes
But this is not enough...
(I believe)
I believe my dream can be reality
I believe my time on earth is destiny (Oh I believe)
(Oh I... I believe... now we are strong enough)
(Oh I... I believe... we are strong enough)
I believe in visions (Oh I... I believe... now we are strong enough)
I believe in love
I believe in magic (Oh I... I believe... we are strong enough)
This is not enough
I believe in freedom (Oh I... I believe... now we are strong enough)
I believe in dreams
I believe in heroes (Oh I... I believe...)
But this is not enough
(we are strong enough)Embed
