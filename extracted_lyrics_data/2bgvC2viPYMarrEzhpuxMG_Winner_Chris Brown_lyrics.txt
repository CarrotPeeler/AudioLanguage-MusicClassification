Yo, it is an honor to introduce the future of R&B
His name, is Chris Brown (Uh)
And uh, you know what this is
Yeah, another Beat Trax joint

Round one, I hear the ding
I walk up and shake your hand, girl, I gotta know what's up
Baby, what's your name? Can I get your number?
'Cause I wanna talk about some things, yeah
Round two, it ain't a thing, I was moving every way you move
Bobbing and weaving, like a young boy was supposed to do
It seemed like only yesterday that we did it
Now you on me like a fitted and I just gotta say, yeah

And I know we're young so it'll be a while before we doing that
But my momma got me in training
Getting ready for the day when I'ma make somebody happy
