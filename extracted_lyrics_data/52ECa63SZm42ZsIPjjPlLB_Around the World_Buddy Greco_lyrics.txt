1 ContributorAround The World LyricsAround the world I've searched for you
I traveled on when hope was gone
To keep a rendezvous
Well I knew somewhere, sometime, somehow
You'd look at me and I would see
That smile you're smiling now
Well, It might have been in County Down
Or in New York, in gay Paree
Or even London town
No more will I go all around the world
For I have found my world in you
Yes around, and around, and around, and around
I've searched for you
I traveled on when hope was gone
To keep a big fat rendezvous
Well I knew somewhere, sometime, somehow
You'd look at me and I would see
That smile you're smiling now
Well, It might have been in County Down
Or in New York, in gay Paree
Or even London town
No more will I go all around the world
Because I like it, I like it, I like it, I like it, I like it, I like it
You might also likeYes around, and around, and around, and around
I've searched for you
I traveled on the hope was gone
To keep a rendezvous
Well I knew somewhere, sometime, somehow
You'd look at me and I would see
That smile you're smiling now
Well, It might have been in County Down
Or in New York, in gay Paree
Or swinging London town
No more will I go all around the world
For I have found my world in you
Yes, I found my world in you
I like it, I like it, I like itEmbed
