You're just a part of the universe, my brother
Listen
Since I'm walking around with you
We might as well try to get to know each other
Because jealousies keep me constantly
Too defensively
One for another
Russia and China too
Well, the U.S. don't know
What they're gonna do about each other
There's a chance of a third world war
And it scares me 'cause I’ve heard news of Hiroshima
I'll be living in a world where no one’s first
Where angry arms can open and embrace
Where men can live together
Loving one another
This is what we seek for you and me, brother
Jealousies keep us constantly
Too defensively toward one another
Life on earth
Take it for what it's worth
Save your universe
Love one another

You're just a part of the universe, my brother
Since I'm walking around with you
We might as well try to get to know each other
Because you know and I know
Jealousies keep us constantly
Too defensively toward one another
Life on earth
Take it for what it's worth
Save the universe
Love one another
Jealousies
