2 ContributorsRain and Snow LyricsWell I married me a wife
She gave me trouble all my life
She ran me out in the cold rain and snow
Rain and snow, rain and snow
She ran me out in the cold rain and snow
She came a runnin on down the stairs
Combin' back her long yellow hair
And her cheeks were as red as a rose
As a rose, as a rose
And her cheeks were as red as a rose
Well I ain't got no use
For your red apple juice
And I'm not gonna be treated this a way
This a way this a way
And I'm not gonna be treated this way
I see you sitting in the shade
Counting every dime I've made
I'm so broke and I'm hungry too
Hungry too, hungry too
I'm so broke and I'm hungry too
I'm so broke and I'm hungry too
