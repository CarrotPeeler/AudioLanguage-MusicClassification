2 ContributorsEverybodyâ€™s Got the Monkey LyricsFrom L.A. to New York, London, and Moscow
The monkey is screamin', he's spreading his spell
The monkey be God and make you beg on your knees
You'll be jonesin' for somethin' to make you well
Everybody's got the monkey
Hear the sub or human kind
Everybody got the monkey
You got yours and I got mine
He's hungry for wealth, he's hungry for power
He make you so numb and cold to the core
The hunger of love, the hunger of lust
Make you crave the very thing you try to ignore
Everybody's got the monkey
Hear the sub or human kind
Everybody got the monkey
You got yours and I got mine
Everybody's got the monkey
In his head or on his back
Everybody got the monkey
What I say is a simple fact
Homos and heteros
Junkies and juicers
Pyschos and users
Abusers and losers
From problem brokers
To TV viewers
There's a monkey for every man
Mom and dad
You might also likeEverybody's got the monkey
Hear the sub or human kind
Everybody got the monkey
You got yours and I got mine
Everybody's got the monkey
In his head or on his back
Everybody's got the monkey
What I say is a simple fact
Everybody's got the monkeyEmbed
