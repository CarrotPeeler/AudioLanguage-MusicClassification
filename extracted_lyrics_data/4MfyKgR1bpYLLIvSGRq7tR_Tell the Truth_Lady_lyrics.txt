I just can't walk away (holdin' his, holdin' his hand)
Not like a mother but I'm his lover
I'll stay there right by his side
Lovin' you placin' my emotions there
I know he always will, wipe away my only tears
I know he always will, hold me in the middle of the night
I know he always will, kiss me there, uhm, that's right
I know he always will
Tell the truth, if you really can now
We would not be here now
Talking bout how we'll pull through
Pushed me away just the other day (I had somethin' on my mind)
Feelin' alone, many miles away (please wake up, please wake up, I'm here)
You'll never find someone like me
I'll stay there right by your side
Lovin' you placin' my emotions there
I know he always will, wipe away my only tears
I know he always will, hold me in the middle of the night
I know he always will, kiss me there, uhm, that's right
I know he always will
Tell the truth, if you really can now
We would not be here now
Talking bout how we'll pull through
Tell the truth if you want to make it
No more givin' I'm takin'
Cause I had enough of you
I'll be there, by your side

Tell the truth, if you really can now
We would not be here now
Talking bout how we'll pull through
Tell the truth if you want to make it
No more givin' I'm takin'
Cause I've had enough of you
Tell the truth
Tell the truth
Tell the truth
