5 ContributorsSend Me Some Lovinâ€™ LyricsSend me some lovin' send it I pray how how can I love you when you're so far away
Send me your picture send it my dear so I can hold it and pretend that you're here
Can you send me your kisses how to feel them at home
I need you so badly I miss you so much
My days are so lonely my nights are so blue
I'm here and I'm lonely I'm waiting for you
Can you send me your kisses...You might also likeEmbed
