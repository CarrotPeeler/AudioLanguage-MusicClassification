1 ContributorLonger Days LyricsWell, I've got a problem
'Cause my time just slips away
Well, I've got a problem
'Cause my time just slips away
Well, I won't sleep at night
Seems like I could use a longer day
Yes, I'm working
Work my fingers to the bone
Well, I'm working
Work my fingers to the bone
You know, I can't help myself
Will be working on and on and on
Money's tighter, tighter
Than it's ever been before
Money's tighter
Than it's ever been before
'Cause, you know, once I let it out
It won't come back to me anymore, no no
You know, once I let it out
It won't come back to me anymore, no no
You know, once I let it out
It won't come back to me anymoreYou might also likeEmbed
