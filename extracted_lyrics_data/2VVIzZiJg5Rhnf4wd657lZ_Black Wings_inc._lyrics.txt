4 ContributorsBlack Wings LyricsIf every life deserves to die
In the dirt, but covered in white
But the dirt don’t apologize
Like her legs when they open wide
Like her legs when they open wide
It was black it was never white
It was black it was never white
Black wings on her back for life
To her skin with the ink and a knife
Black wings on her back for life
Cause if the pain can’t make it right
We were never blind to it
We were never blind to it
We were never blind to it
We were never blind to it
Every dog deserves a fight
But the mouth never got a bite
The birth didn’t make a life
To the birth i apologize
To the dirt i apologize

It was black it was never white
Black wings on her back for life
To her skin with the ink and a knife
Black wings on her back for life
Cause if the pain can’t make it right
But it was never to be said
We were never blind to it
It was never to be said
We were never blind to it
We were never blind to it
It was never to be said
We were never blind to it
We were never blind to itEmbed
