4 ContributorsLittle White Lie LyricsOnce upon a time there was a happy family
There was a baby girl, a daddy and there was a mommy
Mommy had a secret, she told a little white lie
When she tucked the baby in at night, she sang her this lullaby
You got your daddy's smile, you got his eyes
I feel my heart breaking every time you cry
I'm gonna burn in hell but it's no sacrifice
Your stability is worth a million lies
I see your daddy in everything you do
And if you could talk, I'll bet you'll talk like him too
But he can't be your daddy, I hope you understand
The man who thinks he's your father is a much better man
Maybe one day, you'll end up crying on Rikki Lake
But baby it's a chance your momma's willing to take
Cause I love you even if my heart is gonna break
Ain't no reason you should suffer for my mistake
And so I lie and baby I try and it kills me inside, yeah
But I'm gonna live with this until the day I die
And I hurt, baby, oh, how I hurt
But I know what you're worth, yeah
So I'm gonna live with this until I hit the dirt, someday

But at night she smiled when the daddy was by her side
There were times she almost told him and it really broke her heart
But she forced herself to keep the secret that was tearing her apart
Now I can't sleep at night, I've lost my appetite
Everybody keeps saying, "The baby looks kind of light"
And I tell them, "Every newborn baby looks the same"
While I'm praying to God, please make your color change
And the emotions on his face when he's looking at you
I couldn't tell him, he ain't your papa if I wanted to
He's got your picture tattooed on his arm
Now he's bragging to his friends about his firstborn
Oh God and I love him, really I do
If he ever found out it would kill me too
Now I'm caught between a rock and a really hard place
I'd give anything to keep that smile on his face
So I lie, baby I try and it kills me inside, yeah
But I'm gonna live with this until the day I die
And I hurt, baby, oh, how I hurt
But I know what you're worth, yeah
So I'm gonna live with this until I hit the dirt, someday
Mommy kept the family together the best way she could
Cause she knew in this case the truth would do more harm than good
What daddy didn't know, didn't hurt him, he had no cause to fret
And that's as close to happily ever after as anyone can get
Oh how I try, and it kills me inside
But I'm gonna live with this until the day I die
And I hurt, baby, oh, how I hurt
But I know what you're worth, yeah
So I'm gonna live with this until I hit the dirt, somedayEmbed
