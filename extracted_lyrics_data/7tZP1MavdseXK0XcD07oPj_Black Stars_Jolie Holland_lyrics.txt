4 ContributorsBlack Stars LyricsI saw you tonight by the light
Of the shining black stars that circle my heart
I saw you come in, though it was dim
I have been listening from the beginning
When you arrived
It was as if we had both died
And gone somewhere else
You and myself
That otherworldly feeling
Came over me stealing
My mind was reeling
Blood bleeding
Red like my guitar
Whoever you are
Cold in the night
I think you're right
To whisper and listen
Like flowers glisten
In a quiet garden
The moon is wizened and it is old
As a toad in a Chinese story
The fallen glory of my ego
Is laid at the feet of all our purposes
And my purpose is to keep on dreaming
I am fishing for wishes that's where you come in
Though it was dim when you arrived
It was as if we had both died
And gone somewhere else
You and myselfYou might also likeEmbed
