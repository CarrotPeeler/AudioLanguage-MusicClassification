5 ContributorsIntro / Court / Clef / Intro Lyrics
Bring your ass, pump the positivity
From the people who brought you "Nappy Heads" in '94
"The Score" in '96
Now, Wyclef presents The Carnival
Feel the excitement, taste the culture, know who you are
Starring Wyclef as Big Nigga (Big Nigga)
Featuring Lauryn Hill as Mom of the Beat (This wig ain't gonna cut it)
Also Prakazrel as Haitian Harry (Yard mon Harry, Yard bomba-clot mon Harry)
John Forte as Trey-wud (And he just kept fondlin' me right there)
Melky Sedeck as House Nigga (Y'all get off from 'round here)

All rise for the Honorable Judge Bartholomew Holda-niggadown, the third
Federal case number B3946006
The US Government vs. The efforts of He'cliff (Wyclef)
Yeah, yeah, you know what I'm talkin' about, whatever
Yeah, Your Honor, here today, the DA's office will to the jury beyond a reasonable doubt
That this son of a bitch here is not only a player
He's a definite bad influence and is capable of incitin' many riots, Your Honor
He's a goddamn revolutionary
Ayo, Your Honor
This case is pure bishop, okay?
This is a waste of taxpayers money and waste of your time
I'll prove to you of without a'chateau of a doubt (Jesus)
That my clientele is innocent
You might also likeYeah, wha-whatever
Your Honor, I not only have tapes of him incriminating his goddamn self
But I got witnesses of diverse ethnic backgrounds
Who will testify today that Wyâ€” (Today?)
Today, what Wyclef is not innocent, Your Honor (Pas possible)
Hand me the tape
Your Honor, I'd like to enter this as Exhibit A
Play the tape

Ladies and gentlemen
Right about now, if you drivin' in your car, you stuck in traffic
I beg you turn up your radio
We are not stopping for no red lights tonight
Blow your horns
Close the bar down 'cause we are comin' to rob you
Ladies, we beg you, hide your purses
Soldiers, lighters inna the air tonight
Yes, man, arrival of the carnival
New beats, we never recycle
Big up more like Wyclef
More like Prakazrell aka Dirty Cash
More like John Forte, L Joogie
More like Jerry Wonder, Inspectah Lauryn
Soldiers, lighters inna the air
We are not stoppin' for no red light tonight
There is no guest list tonightEmbed
