1 ContributorOn the Beach (The Ladder Descends) LyricsGot your letter on Monday
But I dropped it on the street
And watched it blowing away
Like something meant to be
On the beach, on the beach again
Blown away all the pain you don't need
On the beach, where the sky bleeds the sea
(Sky's calling, I'm falling)
The ladder descends til the parallel world
And I wonder who's living
Under my skin these days
Looking out through the back of my head
Just trying to find my way
On the beach, on the beach again
All the pain, all the pain you don't need
On the beach, with the waves over me
(Sky's calling, I'm falling)
The ladder descends til the parallel world
On the beach, on the beach again
Blown away all the pain you don't need
On the beach, with the waves over me
(Sky's calling, I'm falling)
The ladder descends til the parallel worldYou might also likeEmbed
