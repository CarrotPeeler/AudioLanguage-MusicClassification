3 ContributorsJack Worm Lyrics
Jack Worm came to conquer this world
We all knew that was his intention
To strip the financial market to the bone
And he wouldn't make one exception
Jack was a man with a confidential mind
A great deal of flesh and blood
No doubt about him being the king of the ring
As long as the dough kept coming in

Jack was a healthy man with very steady nerves
His concept was to never think twice
He had the world in his greedy fat hands
He'd succeeded with his made-up device
Jack always wonders what else there's to buy
Worm being worm had it easy to get by
The entire world ate out of his hand
You better figure out a way to take a stand

I am a wealthy man
This is just how I am
It's time to take a stand
This is just my lousy plan
You might also like
Jack rose from the seat at his desk
Pulled aside the curtains for a peak of the street
Set down again and smiled wistfully
It all became clear as he said

I am a wealthy man
This is just how I am
It's time to take a stand
This is just my lousy plan

I am a wealthy man
This is just how I am
It's time to take a stand
This is just my lousy planEmbed
