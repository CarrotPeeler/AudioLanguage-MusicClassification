1 ContributorMeridian LyricsSitting on the meridian
Voices speaking from within
Never seen these days before
Wondering where to begin
Looking to the TV screen
I don't know, don't know what it means
Flashing colors on a screen
Is it true or just a dream?
Running from reality
Have created fantasy
Looking to the TV screen
I don't know, don't know what it means
You choose your reality
You see what you want to see
You hear what you want to hear
To make it through the rest of the day
Some are living in despair
All I seem to do is stare
Someone's living on the rock
Find it hard to even care
You might also likeLooking to the TV screen
I don't know, don't know what it means
You choose your reality
You see what you want to see
You hear what you want to hear
To make it through the rest of the day
Day
Day
Sitting on the meridian
Voices speaking from within
Never seen these days before
Wondering where to begin
Looking to the TV screen
I don't know, don't know what it means, yeahEmbed
