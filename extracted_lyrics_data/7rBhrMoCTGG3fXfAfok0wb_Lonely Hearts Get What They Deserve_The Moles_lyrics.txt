2 ContributorsLet My People Go Lyrics(You wanna hear a story?)
(Woo-hoo)
A call was sent to Heaven about power being abused
Heaven chose a deliverer
The most unlikely to be used
Go tell those in power
To whom much is given
(Much is required)
Much is required
Tell them they can't really lead
(They can't really lead)
Unless they're leading with the eyes of those they hired
(They can lead with the eyes of those they hired)
(Those who do the work)
Those who do the work
(They deserve the praise)
They deserve the praise
Their gender shouldn't determine the amount
Or the pay raise
Human trafficking, systematic oppression
To right to left
And left to right
We are all God's children
And we're all precious
(Precious in His eyes)
Let the church say amen
(Amen)
You might also like(Aye man, respect my people)
(Don't you cause them harm)
(You may think you're in the power seat)
(But you can't box with God, respect my children)
(They are royalty)
(The way you treat the least of these is the way you treat me)
(Heaven to Pharaoh, let my people go)
(You can fill my indigo, in the field my daffodils)
That's a pretty flower in the hand of a Pharaoh
Shall I pick you like cotton?
Or work you like oxen
(La, la, la, la, la)
If I'm honest, I would never get these royal hands dirty
Not when I have you Hebrews here to do the work for me
Now go
And note that the sun will rise and set on my face
No one will take my place
(Respect my people)
For I am the king
(Don't you cause them harm)
(You may think you're in the power seat)
(But you can't box with God, respect my children)
(They are royalty)
(They way you treat the least of these is the way you treat Me)
(Heaven to Pharaoh, let my people go)
I got brothers and sisters that look like me
Warm like me, brown like me, lost like me
Looking for a god they've never been found like me
Where I'm from, religion runs deep like police and politics
Don't like me, 'cause I'm different
(I'm still so very different)
With free beliefs of stranger fiction
Wait, this is scary scary, don't leave me, leave me
(Leave me)
Oh Lord, my heart be heavy, won't You light a fire for me
(Won't You light a fire for me)
Come my way when I get lonely
That's what God told me
He let a cloud for sight, in case my nights get stormy
(I'm lonely so lonely)
Yesterday was yesterday
Pulling sand, that's what I wait
There's my Father, see the struggle of His children
People dying, family crying, lot of 'em try and tell me
How can I hold on?
(How can I hold on? How can I hold on?)
(Hold on)
(On a day)
On a day as angry as the sun
And as calm as a burning bush
God came to Moses and told him to take the deep road
I've seen My people struggle and you shall free them of their bounds
They can no longer be held past
(Respect my people)
Let 'em go
(Don't you cause them harm)
Yep
(You may think you're in the power seat)
(But you can't box with God, respect my children)
To whom much is given
(They are royalty)
Much is required
(They way you treat the least of these is the way you treat Me)
Treat 'em right
(Heaven to Pharaoh, let these are my people)
To Pharaoh, let my people go
(They are royalty)
They are royalty
(They way you treat the least of these is the way you treat Me)
Oh
Yeah
(Heaven to Pharaoh, let my people go)
Human trafficking
(They are royalty)
Let 'em go
(They way you treat the least of these is the way you treat Me)
(Heaven to Pharaoh, let my people go)
Systematic oppression, ha
(They are royalty)
Yeah
(They way you treat the least of these is the way you treat Me)
And he too
Let 'em go
(Heaven to Pharaoh, let my people go)
I said he had a people oh no, He called me by my name
Name
Oh
Well let me see that a day
That I'm, that I'm the same, mm-hmm
Tank always comes to the Bangas
Things are overflowing around me, you can say
The same
(The same, the same)
The same
Uh, they wanna say that I changed
(Changed)
I didn't do this, to stay the sameEmbed
