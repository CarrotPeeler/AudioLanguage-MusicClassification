Too many stories I can't tell
Too much loss of memory
Too many bottles of Rebel Yell
One more night in a roadhouse
I figure I might as well
Cause I know when it's all over for me
I'll be headin' down to Honky Tonk Hell
Well Honky Tonk Hell
Where the beer tastes like water
And the wine don't ever flow
Juke box blown, if you wanna hear a song
Twisted Sister on the radio
Honky Tonk gals in the neon lights
Won't be dancin' in my sinner's cell
Well every night around closin' time
I'm gonna nurse another heartache spell
Down in Honky Tonk Hell
Well brother if you think you got a future
It might be time to change your life (uh huh)
Think about the ones that love you
And all the misery and strife
Once you crawl inside of that bottle
It's mighty hard to crawl up out of that well
You know you don't wanna wind up like me
Just a drinkin' in Honky Tonk Hell
You might also likeHonky Tonk Hell
Where the beer tastes like water
And the wine don't ever flow
Juke box blown if you wanna hear a song
Twisted sister on the radio
Honky Tonk gals in the neon lights
Won't be dancin' in my sinner's cell
Well every night around closin' time
I'm gonna nurse another heartache spell
Down in Honky Tonk Hell
Down in Honky Tonk Hell
Now Honky Tonk Hell
Where the beer tastes like water
And the wine don't never flow
Juke box gone if you wanna hear a song
Twisted sister on the radio
The Honky Tonk gals in the neon lights
Won't be dancin' in my sinner's cell
Well every night around closin' time
I'm gonna nurse another heartache spell
Down in Honky Tonk Hell
Down In Honky Tonk Hell
One wife, two on the side
Too many stories I can't tellEmbed
