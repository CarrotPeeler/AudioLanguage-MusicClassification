1 ContributorSpace Age Blues LyricsDont have no motivation. For techno innovation. I have the Space Age Blues. My girl is gone and my, old van got stolen someday, I have the Space Age Blues. Its my mission with precision, found a way to speak against the opposition, if my brain feels the same, wasting time while I'm wrapped in flames. All I have to give is my self expression, rest on the back of the expectations, of my goal in my soul, gotta have a moment to set this soul. Getting nowhere lighting fast, look out kid cuz life don't last, think you gotta line on something new, all you really got are the Space Age Blues. Dont have no motivation. For techno innovation. I have the Space Age Blues. My girl is gone and my, old van got stolen someday, I have the Space Age Blues. Ive got to say what I feel so strong, never had a doubt that we were in our wrongs. Streets are filled with angry suckers. Trying to pull a dime from their empty pockets. Meanwhile half way across the world. Some poor kid gets shot down cold. Buy and larges just don't meet, cuz everybody's got the Space Age Blues. Dont have no motivation. For techno innovation, I have the Space Age Blues. My girl is gone and my, old van got stolen someday, I have the Space Age Blues. Yeah, yeah yeah. I have the Space Age Blues. Yeah, yeah yeah. I have the Space Age Blues. (Then a long ooooooo, Then:) Yeah, yeah yeah. I have the Space Age Blues. Yeah, yeah yeah. I have the Space Age Blues. I have the Space Age BluesYou might also likeEmbed
