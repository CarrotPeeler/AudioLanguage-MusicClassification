I stand watching it
Keep on giving it to us
Silence over me
Keep on holding me
Every night
I know where you sleep
And it's hurting me
It's hurting me
When I want it all
For myself
I want it all
I want him for myself
I want it all
You tease me
Telling me
It's over
Wait and see
Leave it
You're lying
When you tell me
You're not happy
Come to me
For sympathy
Every night
I know where you sleep
And it's hurting me
It's hurting me

For myself
I want it all
I want him for myself
I want it all
Tide keeps rolling in
I stand watching
As you keep on giving it to her
Keep on
Keep it on
Time isn't holding us
Isn't after us
It's hurting me
When I want it all
For myself
I want it all
I want him for myself
I want it allEmbed
