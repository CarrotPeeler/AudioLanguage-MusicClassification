A charge to keep I have
A God to glorify
A never-dying soul to save
And fit it for the sky
A charge to keep I have
A God to glorify
A never-dying soul to save
And fit it for the sky
A charge to keep I have
A God to glorify
A never-dying soul to save
And fit it for the sky


A charge to keep I have
A God to glorify
A never-dying soul to save
Fit it, fit it
Fit it, and fit it
And fit it for
The skyYou might also likeEmbed
