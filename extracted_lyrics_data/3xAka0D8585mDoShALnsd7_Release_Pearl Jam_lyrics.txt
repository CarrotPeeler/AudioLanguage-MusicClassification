(Ah)
Oh, oh
Oh

I see the world, feel the chill
Which way to go, windowsill
I see the words on a rockin' horse of time
I see the birds in the rain, oh

Oh, oh
Oh, oh

Oh, dear Dad, can you see me now?
I am myself, like you somehow
I'll ride the wave where it takes me
I'll hold the pain, release me

Oh, oh I
Oh, oh

Oh, dear Dad, can you see me now?
I am myself, like you somehow
I'll wait up in the dark for you to speak to me
I'll open up, release me
Release me
Release me, ah
Release me
