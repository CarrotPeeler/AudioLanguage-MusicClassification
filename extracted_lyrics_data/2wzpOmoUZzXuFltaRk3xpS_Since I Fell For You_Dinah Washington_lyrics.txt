6 ContributorsSince I Fell for You LyricsYou made me leave my happy home
You took my love and now you're gone
Since I fell for you
Love brings such misery and pain
I guess I'll never be the same
Since I fell for you
Oh, it's too bad, oh, it's too sad
That I'm in love with you
You loved me, then you snubbed me
But what can I do
Cause I'm still in love with you
Oh, I guess I'll never see the light
I get the blues most every night
Since I fell for you
Well, it's too bad, oh, it's too sad
That I'm in love with you
You loved me, then you snubbed me
But what can I do
Cause I'm still in love with you
Oh, I guess I'll never see the light
I get the blues 'bout every night
Since I fell for you
