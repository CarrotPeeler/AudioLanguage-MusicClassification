2 ContributorsLove Is Here to Stay LyricsIt's very clear
Our love is here
To stay
Not for a year
But ever and a day
The radio and the telephone and the movies that we know
May just be passing fancies and in time may go
But oh, my dear
Our love is here
To stay
Together we're
Going a long, long way
In time the Rockies may crumble
Gibraltar may tumble
They're only made of clay
But our love is here to stay
In time the Rockies may crumble
Gibraltar may tumble
They're only made of clay
But our love is here to stayYou might also like1Embed
