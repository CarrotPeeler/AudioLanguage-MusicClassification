1 ContributorSentimental Times LyricsIt's been many years now, since you passed away
Somedays I stil wait for you to call
Been through some hard times, mom, but we made it out alright
I just wish I could tell you bout it all
Oh my oh myy
All these emotions running my mind
These are my sentimental times
Driving through the neighborhood where my best friend's parents used to live
It's all deserted and gray
Coffee shop's gone, bank's moved on, bike trail to the lakes all overgrown
Katrina came, and took it all away
Oh my oh myy
All these emotions running my mind
These are my sentimental times
