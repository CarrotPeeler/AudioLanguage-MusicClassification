5 ContributorsUnder Black Flags We March Lyrics
Your hate is our trigger
Revolution now
The more we have to suffer
The more we will fight (Fight, fight, fight, fight)

With our fists
Up in the air

Legions marching
Ready to fire
These streets will burn
Let the black flag rise
Legions marching
Ready to fire
Empires of corruption
Crash and fall
Under black flags we march

The voice of rebellion
Calls your name
Servants of the truth
Are standing tall

Empires of corruption
Crash and fall (Fall, fall)
