2 ContributorsHeart On A String LyricsTaking the thick and the thin
Afraid to complain, no there's no use complaining
You know your hearts on a string
Hiding the feelings away
Scared to offend, dreading the ending
You know your hearts on a string
Try to pretend, try to pretend, you're in control
Try to deny, try to deny, you're under control
Waiting patiently through, the lack of affection returning the silence
Don't show your hearts on a string
Staying alone in the evening, waiting for fate & hating the weakness
Don't show your hearts on a string
Try to pretend, try to pretend, you're in control
Try to deny, try to deny, you're under control
Heart on a string taking care not to break it
Heart on a string taking care not to shake it
Heart on a string just a twist it could tear you apart
Heart on a string taking care not to break it
Heart on a string so aware not to shake it
Heart on a string just a twist it could tear it apart

You won't complain
You won't complain
You'll take, you'll take the thick and the thin
You'll take, you'll take the thick and the thin
It's only a twist, only a twist and it's gone
Only a twist, only a twist, only a twist, only a twist and you're gone
Heart on a string so aware not to break it
Heart on a string so aware not to shake it
Heart on a string just a twist it could tear you apart
Heart on a string taking care not to break it
Heart on a string so aware not to shake it
Heart on a string just a twist it could tear you apart
Just a twist it could tear it apartEmbed
