One night, one ni-ee-ii-ee-i-i-ight
One night I was layin' down
I hear my mama and papa talking-ahh
I hear them say, "Lo-ooo-oh-ord
You've gotta let that boy b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-boo-gie"
I think John Lee Hooker said that
Oooh boogie boogie, oh boogie
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, boo-gie mama

A-mama done told me, a-papa done too
The way that you move, it's no good for you-yah
A-boogie mama, boogie mama
Boogie mama, boogie all night long

Baby told me late last night
"The way that ya move, it's just a little too tight
Shake it, baby, shake it, baby, shake it, baby
Shake it one time, one time"

Some people like to rock
Some people like to roll
But movin' and-a groovin' gonna
Satisfy my soul

Let's have a party, whoo
Let's have a party
Send 'im to the store, let's buy some more
Let's have a party tonight

No Honky-tonky Joe
Is knockin' at the door
So bring 'im in and fill 'im up
And send 'im t' buy some more

Let's have a party, whoo
Let's have a party
Ooh, send to the store let's buy some more
Let's have a party tonight, rock it


I've never kissed a bear
I've never kissed a goon
But I can shake a chicken
In the middle of

Let's have a party, ahh
Let's have a party
Send to the store, let's buy some more
Let's have a party tonight
We gonna have a party tonight


I said, "Hello, Mary Lou, goodbye, heart"
Sweet Mary Lou, I'm so in love with you
I knew Mary Lou, we'd never part
So hello, Mary Lou, goodbye, heart

She passed me by one sunny day, avoid those big brown eyes my way
Oooh, I never did see you before
I'm no one that gets around, swear my feet stuck to the ground
Ooh, I never did see you before

I said, "Hello, Mary Lou, ahh, goodbye, heart"
Sweet Mary Lou, I'm so in love with you
I knew Mary Lou, we'd never part
So, hello, Mary Lou, goodbye, heart, rock it, rock it, rock it


I saw your lips, I heard your voice, believe me, I just had no choice
Wild horses couldn't make me stay away
I'm not one that gets around, swear my feet stuck to the ground
Ooh, I never did see you before

I said, "Hello, Mary Lou, ahh goodbye, heart"
Sweet Mary Lou, I'm so in love with you
I knew Mary Lou, we'd never part
So, hello, Mary Lou, goodbye heart
I said, "Hello, Mary Lou, goodbye, heart"


Well, I did not say I was a millionaire
I said I could have spent more money than a millionaire
An' if you and I'd 've kept all the money that we already spent
We would have been millionaires a long, long, long time ago, don't you dig it?
And women, and women, good little women
Oh, I'm goin' down slow

I have had my fun
If I never, never, never, never, never get well no mo'
Ooooh, I have had my fun, children
If I never, never, never get well no mo'
Whoa, yes, my health is fadin'
Ooh yeah, I'm goin' down slow, it ain't all that bad
Hey!


Pleaaaaaaaaaaase write my mama
Tell her, tell her the shape I'm in
Please, please, please, please, please, please, oh-oh-oh, please write my mama
Tell her, oh, the shape I'm in
You can tell her to pray for me, pray for me
Please forgive me, whoa-oh-oooh-oh-oooh, whoa-ooh-oh
Forgive me for my sins

Woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman

Way down inside
You need-yeah, love
All right
Shake for me, girl
I wanna be your backdoor man
Sho' nuff, sho' nuff
Keep a-coolin', baby
A-coolin', baby
Keep a-coolin', baby
Keep a-coolin', baby
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Boogie, boogie, boogie
Oh-aye-aye-aye-aye
