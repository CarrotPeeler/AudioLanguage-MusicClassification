1 ContributorSee Me Through LyricsDarlin wherever I go
You know whatever I do
And girl wherever I go
Know I'm thinkin' of you
That its true that I do
Your love is gonna see me through
Girl whenever I'm down
You know whenever I'm blue
Wherever I'm alone
Girl you carry me though
Oh you do and that's true
Your love is gonna see me through
Your love is gonna see me through
(bridge)
Darlin wherever I go
You know whatever I do
Wherever I go
Know I'm thinkin' of you
Oh you know it's true that I do
Your love is gonna see me through
Your love is gonna see me through
Your love is gonna see me throughYou might also likeEmbed
