No time for farewells
I don't get much done on a road too soft
Sure, we fell on some hard times, honey
Who doesn't? Doesn't mean we can't get back up
I always say this song will be the last I ever write
But I also said this year will be my last
Chasing you
Chasing you up the hill, come on

Ring the bell
Ring the bell
Ring the bell
For me, I need you to
Ring the bell
Ring the bell
And I'll come to you

Don't think yourself unusual
Like you're the first to send a prayer
Way out into the infinite unknown
Only to be told return to sender
One of us is always halfway out the door
When the other one wants back in
But honey, the distance we cover
Is only equal to the work we put in
Come on
You might also like
Ring the bell
Ring the bell
Ring the bell
For me
Ring the bell
Ring the bell
Ring the bell
For me

Are you the answer to the question in my heart?
You are the answer to the question in my heart
I am the answer to the question in my heart
When you need me, when you want me
When you need me, when you want me
Why doesn't it hurt?
Ring the bell, ring the bell for me
When you need
Are you the answer to the question in my heart?
When you hurt me
And when I want you
When I need you
When you need me, when you want me
When I need you
When I need you1Embed
