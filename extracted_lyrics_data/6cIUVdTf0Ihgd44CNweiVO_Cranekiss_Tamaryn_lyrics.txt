3 ContributorsCranekiss Lyrics
Love, wind around me
Peel you
A round heart

Lovers at the wrong kiss
And at the wrong tongue
I'm always at the wrong pace

I know you feel me burn up
Just like the heat of the sun
I know you feel me burn up
I'm charmed to kiss you long
I know you feel me burn up
Just like the heat of the sun
I know it faded all along

You've seemed to move on now
Forget what you wanted
Take what you want
Get what you want
I've seemed to move on now
Forget what they wanted
I take who I want
Do what they want
You might also likeYou've seemed to move on now
Forget what you wanted
Take what you want
Get what you want
I've seemed to move on now
Forget what they wanted
I take who I want
Do what they want

Love wild
Pull me in
I'm fall, falling

I know you feel me burn up
Just like the heat of the sun
I know you feel me burn up
I'm charmed to kiss you long
I know you feel me burn up
Just like the heat of the sun
I know it faded all along

You've seemed to move on now
Forget what you wanted
Take what you want
Get what you want
I've seemed to move on now
Forget what they wanted
I take who I want
Do what they want
You've seemed to move on now
Forget what you wanted
Take what you want
Get what you want
I've seemed to move on now
Forget what they wanted
I take who I want
Do what they want3Embed
