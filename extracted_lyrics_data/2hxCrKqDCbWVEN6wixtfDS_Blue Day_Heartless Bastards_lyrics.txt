2 ContributorsBlue Day LyricsIt's been a long day
When nothin' seems to be goin' my way
I really don't need a lot
Just tryin' to hold on to what I got
Lord knows it's been a while
Since my face has cracked a smile
So hot in the midday sun
Seem to be burnin' everyone
Oh, the self destruction
It is keep me from functionin'
And I try to build things up
I build things up and I tear them down
Oh, I'm escapin'
I'm escapin' this big blue day
And now I am tryin'
Tryin' to look out into the horizon
Oh, I got no motivation
Oh, I need some inspiration
I try and get some motivation
To help me, help me get through this day
And then the winter comes
I'm hardly seein' any sun
Hibernation's takin' me
Into a distant sleep
You might also likeLord knows it's been a while
Since my face has cracked a smile
So cold in the winter months
Seem to be chillin' everyone
Oh, the self destruction
It is keep me from functionin'
And I try to build things up
I build things up and I tear them down
Oh, I'm escapin'
I'm escapin' this big blue day
And now I am tryin'
Tryin' to look out into the horizon
Oh, I got no motivation
Oh, I need some inspiration
I try and get some motivation
To help me, help me get through this day
Oh, I'm escapin'
I'm escapin' this big blue day
And now I am tryin'
Tryin' to look out into the horizon
Oh, I'm escapin'
I'm escapin' this big blue day
And now I am tryin'
Tryin' to look out into the horizonEmbed
