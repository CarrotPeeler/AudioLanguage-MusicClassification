3 ContributorsThe Devilâ€™s Daughter LyricsShe's got a hook in me, right from the start
She's got a hook in me, right from the start
She threw a pitch fork, right clean, through my heart
If I was drowning, she would hand me, hand me a glass of water
If I was drowning, and going under, she would hand me, hand me a glass of water
I'm in trouble now - 'cause I think I married the devil's daughter
Whoa she wicked 'n wild
She got evil on her mind
Voodoo in her blood
Evil on her mind
Dirty devil's daughter, she'll get you every time
Damn she's a ball of fire
And the flames keep getting higher
Man she's on fire
The flame, the flames keep getting higher
I think and went and married, I married the devil's daughter
Grandma, Grandpa, say son - you're the devil's son in law
Because, right now, right now, I'm the devil's son in lawYou might also likeEmbed
