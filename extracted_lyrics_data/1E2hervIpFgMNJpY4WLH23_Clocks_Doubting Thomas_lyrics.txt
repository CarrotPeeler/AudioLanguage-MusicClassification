Can you see your reflection
False strength, hollow protection
Run from pain and rejection
The truth stabs again

Until the skin is broken
And the cut is open
And the words once spoken
Just fade away

Too late, standing on the trap door 

Big head leads to confusion
Strong heart pumps up delusion
Tough talk, one voice communion
Medicate the pain

Justify your ego
Living with denial
And the thoughts so vile
Won't fade away
You might also like
Too late, standing on the trap door 

It's coming
You're falling
You're on your own with no one left to blame
Can't sleep 'cause you've made your own bed
The sentence of the helpless
Sink deep to the trial in your head
The court of the selfish
Why? Tell me why can't evade or escape the reality
A true lie and a broken promise
A Judas and a doubting Thomas
A tragedy just to keep you honest
Guilty always fall
Through the trap door
Fear the trap door
Through the trap door
The trap door 

No fear, too scared to look up
Can't win, nothing but bad luck
Clock ticks, your time to face up
You can't run for long
When your world is broken
Your trap door is open
The very words you choke on
Just fade away

Too late, standing on the trap door 2Embed
