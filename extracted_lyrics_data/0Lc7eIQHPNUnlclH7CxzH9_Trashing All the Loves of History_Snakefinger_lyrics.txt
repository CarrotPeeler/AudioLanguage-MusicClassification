Livin’ on the lovers of the air, they aren’t aware
They have the plan
Livin’ on the lovers of the sea, they’re not for me
They aren’t free

Trashing all the loves of history
Listen to the voice of age
We used to be a hidden mystery
Now it’s splashed across the front page

Lookin’ all the lovers of the fire, they can’t aspire
To leave them mild
I said, look at the lovers of the ice, take my advice
They aren’t amazed

Trashing all the loves of history
Listen to the voice of age
We used to be a hidden mystery
Now it’s splashed across the front page

You might also like
Look at all the lovers of the earth, they’re full of mirth
That’s all they’re worth
Look at all the lovers of the void, they’re unemployed
Should be destroyed

Trashing all the loves of historyEmbed
