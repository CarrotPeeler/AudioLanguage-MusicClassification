8 ContributorsSword of Damocles Lyrics
Will you take the dare if it ever was placed?
There's danger to challenge the throne
Deceivers will rise and weave their web of stealth
Can you face them standing alone?

When men lead by words that are false as they preach
Fatality waits in the wings
Surrounded by fools behind walls that are breached
Beware of the jester that sings

Stand tall, rise up
Stay strong fighting your enemies
Truth will find it's reward
If you live and die by the sword

The whispers can't hide when the tongues are let loose
Then hiding the truth is absurd
A stab in the back or a taste of the noose
Is when action speaks louder than words

Stand tall, rise up
Stay strong fighting your enemies
Truth will find it's reward
If you live and die by the sword

Sword of Damocles


Stand tall rise up stay strong fighting your enemies
Truth will find it's reward
If you live and die by the sword

His truth will find its reward
If you live and die by the sword1Embed
