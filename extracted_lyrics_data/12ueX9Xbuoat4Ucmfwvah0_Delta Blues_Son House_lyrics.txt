3 ContributorsDelta Blues LyricsMm, I'm going to be bad no more
I said I declare I ain't going to be bad no more
When I leave this time baby I'm
Going to hang crepe on your door
Look it you darling, what do you want me to do
Look it ya darling, what do you want me to do
I've done all I could honey
Just don't get along with you
Now look it here baby, please don't dog me round
Look it here honey, please don't you dog me round
Mm I'm going to leave south end of town
I went in my room and I sat down and cried
Mm went in my room and I sat down and cried
I didn't have no blues, but I just wasn't satisfied
Look it here darling, what do you want me to do
Look it here little girl, what do you want me to do
I've done all I could do darling
Just don't get along with you
Well, I'm going to be bad no more
Mm I'm not going to be bad no more
When I leave her I'm going to hang crepe on your door
You might also likeI cried last night all on love before
Ooh, all on love before
I'm going to change my way of livin'
And I won't have to cry no more
The sun going to shine my back door some day
Sun going to shine my back door some day
Oh the wind gonna rise and blow my blues awayEmbed
