1 ContributorGamelan LyricsTake me for the fool for you that I am
Idolise me
Philosophise me
Change me from the innocent to the wisest of men
Make me a believer...
Make me a believer
Disorganise me
De-civilise me
Introduce me to the truth of what it really means
Desensitise me
Look in the eyes me
Speak to me in tongues that only you and I understand
Make me a believer...
Make me a believer
Take by surprise me
Word to the wise me
Take me deep into the core until I'm at the seams
Theorise me
Then realise me
Take me from reality into a thing of dreams
Make me a believer...
Make me a believer
Idolise me
Philosophise me
Change me from the innocent to the wisest of men
Desensitise me
Look in the eyes me
Speak to me in tongues only that you and I understand
Make me a believer...
Make me a believer
My eyes are open and my senses are bright
Rain down your light
And wake me from this night...
Magnetise me
Take me for the fool for you that I amYou might also likeEmbed
