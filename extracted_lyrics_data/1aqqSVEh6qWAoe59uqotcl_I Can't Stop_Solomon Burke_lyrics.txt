When I'm in your arms, honey, holdin' you this way
You got to understand that I'm not here to play
Will you forgive me if I don't obey you
When you tell me to stop doin' the things I'm gonna do? ha

I can't stop, no, no, no
I can't stop lovin' you

You say you got your reputation to protect
But let me tell you, baby, now you got full respect
I don't wanna do anything you don't want me to, ha
Just keep in mind, baby, I'm in love with you

I can't stop, no, no, no
I can't stop, ha, lovin' you

Please understand I don't wanna wreck your life
I couldn't do anything to cause you strife
When I kiss your lips I just surely can't help myself
My mind's on lovin' you, and, honey, nothin' else
You might also like
I can't stop, I can't stop
No, no, no, no, no, no
Lovin' you
No, no, no
Lovin' you, no

I can't stop
I can't, can't, can't, can't stop
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, y'all
I can't stop, y'all, no
I can't stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, y'allEmbed
