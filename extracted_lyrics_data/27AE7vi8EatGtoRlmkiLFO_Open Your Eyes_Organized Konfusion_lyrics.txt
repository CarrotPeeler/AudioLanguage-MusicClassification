Open your eyes, wake up
World doesn't realize that he's coming

There's just too many rages
Too many infinite screams at night, we're living in concrete cages
Another child is doomed, to be torn in his mother's womb
By the spark of the twelve gauges
Sometimes it seems like I can't go on, I can't go on
But when I envision a black man with thorns in his hand
On a crucifix, I get strong
Never will I ever let a devil ever deceive me again (Hah), mislead me
'Cause I'ma hit you where it's gonna hurt (Yeah)
Because the flesh is meaningless, it remains amongst the dirt
But the soul is uplifted
10-31-67, I'm God gifted
The seasons change and it grows like a fungus
Beware the evil that walks among us
Behold a fallen angel, hark, the rebel
The mark of 6-6-6, the Devil
You better beware 'cause he's comin behind you
No, it doesn't take long for him to find you
It's a sneak attack, black, he's gonna smack you
In the form of a rock that's inside of a capsule
Or maybe in the form of a man
That says to trust me and then begins to shake your hand
But when you examine your hand you learn, you're alarmed
That your palm was disfigured and burned
No, no, no, no, it's not surprising
Open your book, look to the horizon
Start scoping, open your eyes and strive to
Study the holy Quran, I'm reading the Holy Bible
I'm making a getaway, plan is, gonna be a better way
There's gotta be a better day

Open your eyes, wake up
World doesn't realize that he's coming
Open your eyes, wake up
World doesn't realize that he's coming
Open your eyes, wake up
World doesn't realize that he's coming
Open your eyes, wake up
World doesn't realize that he's coming

Hmmâ€”and now I ask, Lord have mercy upon me
And grant me sight, for what I can't see
For you are the shepherd and I shall not want
To front, yes, to be blunt, I won't flunk
For I am blessed with the gift of knowledge (yeah)
Without college, but now let's shift
Into the specific dimension that we call Earth
Where God gave us the gift of birth
That's when Ephesians 6 tells you to teach the child
Revelation tells about today's wars, the guns and diseases
Homicides over epidemics and crack vials
Got guns going buck, buck, buck
And when you look up you see a kid got struck
But mentally the blood pours out of the mother's heart
'Cause it hurts to lose to Lucifer's part (Mm, yeah)
Yes, for I have seen the light
That shines bright even in the dark of the night
And I (I) thank (thank) thee (thee)
For constantly watching over me
There are about, four hundred and fifty-thousand homeless without housing
Brothers sharing cells and sharing beds
They can't seek a job if his hair has dreads
Sit back and face reality with these lyrics
I hope they can uplift your spirits
(We're living in the last days, we're living in the last days)
'Cause God made water and trees, food, man, woman
Land, fire, grass, animals, clouds and sunrays to shine
On the parents of those twenty-six kids that died last year (Last year)
And it's a shame, it's a crying shame, uhh
Sometimes I felt that I was there
You better get up and wipe the  your eyes
And get right with the master of the sky
Open your eyes, wake up
World doesn't realize that he's coming
Open your eyes, wake up
World doesn't realize that he's coming
Open your eyes, wake up
World doesn't realize that he's coming
Open your eyes, wake up
World doesn't realize that he's comingEmbed
