Ooh ooh yeah
Don't tell it's over oh no no
Only the strong will survive
Don't tell me baby oh no no
You will go out of my life
I can not breath
I can not sleep
If you will break my heart
And I can not live
I can not speak
Baby don't tear apart
Only a fool will leave this lonely woman
Yes I know
Only a fool won't take this angel home
I'll never give up
I'll never let go
If you will break my heart
And I promise you
Baby you know
If you will try a start
