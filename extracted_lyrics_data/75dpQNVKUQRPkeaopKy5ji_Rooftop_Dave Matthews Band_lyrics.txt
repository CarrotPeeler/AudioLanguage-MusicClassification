3 ContributorsRooftop Lyrics
Standing on a rooftop
All these people watching
It's hard to find the words when
You got so far to fall
Just trying to keep a secret
Never tell a soul, no no
Let's take another drink so
I can lose control

I, I want you to
Tell me that you want me
Want me too
Well I, I want you to
Tell me that you want me
Want me too

If I was a winner
I'd cut the cards and deal them
Buy a great big house where
We could disappear
But you find yourself a sweet spot
People want to get some
You're just another dead man
Trying to fool the world
You might also like
I, I want you to
Tell me that you want me
Want me too, yeah
I, I want you to
Tell me that you want me
Want me too

Oh, oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Gave you the best of me
And you said goodbye
Should've taken the rest of me
See the morning come up, come up
If you're going out tonight
Maybe I'll catch your eye
Maybe we'll lose our minds tonight
We'll fall until we fly

I, I want you to
Tell me that you want me
Want me too
I, I want you to
Tell me that you want me
Want me too
I, I want you to
Tell me that you want me
Want me too
I, I want you to
Tell me that you want me
Want meEmbed
