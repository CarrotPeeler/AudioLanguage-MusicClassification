1 ContributorSimple Lyrics
Your back's to the wall
You've got something to lean on
It can't be all that bad
When you're down on the ground
You can't fall much further down
So get back on your feet instead

Hope dies last
Put yourself to the test
You'll see you can't lose what you never had
It's as simple as that

When you're alone
Make the choice on your own
Forget those voices in your head
And when you get burnt
Another lesson gets learnt
That's something you should not regret

Hope dies last
Put yourself to the test
You'll see you can't lose what you never had
It's as simple as that
As simple as that

Hope dies last
Put yourself to the test
You'll see you can't lose what you never had now
Life's a drag
So try and make the best
Of every time they stab you in the back, yeah
Hope dies last
Hope dies last
But you can't lose what you never had
It's as simple as that
As simple as that
