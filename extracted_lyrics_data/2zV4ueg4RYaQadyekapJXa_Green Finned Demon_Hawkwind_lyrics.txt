3 ContributorsGreen Finned Demon LyricsHe Draws the moon towards him
With a wand of whales' bone
The submarine magician is returning to his home
His slow hair floats around him
And his cloak spreads like a flower
The submariner has the oceans in his power
Green finned demon take me down
Green finned demon take me down
He speaks the bubbling language
Of everything that swims
He knows the eightfold secret
Of the Octopus's limbs
His skin is silver scales
And his hair is green as weed
His eyes are phosphorescent
A sea-horse for his steed
Green finned demon take me down
Green finned demon take me down
Captain Nemo knew him
In his underwater deep
He understands the meaning
Of the dolphins' joyful leap
Green finned demon take me downSee Hawkwind LiveGet tickets as low as $103You might also likeEmbed
