4 ContributorsHoly Commotion Lyrics
Aaaaah
A mass of devotion
Aaaaah
And a Holy commotion
I just want, I want, I want, to see your face
I just want, I want, I want to change your place
Lift your bill

Aaaaah
A mass of devotion
Aaaaah
And a Holy commotion
I just want, I want, I want to lead the blind
I just want, I want, I want to free your mind
Come on baby

Aaaaah
A mass of devotion
Aaaaah
And a Holy commotion
I just want, I want, I want to see the light
I just want, I want, I want to dance all night
Oh be my baby
You might also likeWhen the walls come tumbling down
And the love drags all around
And the dogs of war come around no more
No more rape or torture or mutilation
One love one way
One humanity
One way one love
One humanity

Devotion, devotion
Listen
Come on
Devotion, devotion, devotion
Devotion
Come onEmbed
