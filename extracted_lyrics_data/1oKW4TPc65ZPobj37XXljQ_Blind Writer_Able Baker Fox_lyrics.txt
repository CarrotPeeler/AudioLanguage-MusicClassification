1 ContributorBlind Writer LyricsI'm writing blind again
I wonder how this will end
How did this all begin?
Am I being untrue?
That's what you do
You're talking in your sleep
I listen to you dream
And I wonder is it me or
The devils that you see
To ease you
Here we are
Right on time
To fall apart
And crack the spines of this book
That I am writing blind
I'm writing blind again
Here we are
Right on time
To fall apart
And crack the spines
Of this book that I
Am writing blind
Like a message hidden in the bible
It's a story that has a moral
And never ends
One page is optimistic
The end is apocalyptic
And you must choose the way
Heed the path I've enjoyed my stay
And i've learned some things
Let's get this over with
Let's turn the pageYou might also likeEmbed
