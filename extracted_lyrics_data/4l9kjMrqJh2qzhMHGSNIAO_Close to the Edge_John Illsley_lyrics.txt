1 ContributorClose to the Edge LyricsGetting close to the edge hanging by a silver thread
You tried to climb a mountain. Now you're climbing walls instead
Getting close to the edge hanging by a silver thread
Is it best to toe the line or go where Angels fear to tread
Broken stones and broken bones
Broken hearts and broken homes
Nothing left except your pride
When all this energy collides
Getting close to the edge
Hanging by a silver thread
You tried to climb a mountain
Now you're climbing walls instead
Heard some rumours of the future
Better make sense of today
No one wants to be a martyr
When there's other games to play
Getting close to the edge
Hanging by a silver thread
Is it best to toe the line
Or go where angels fear to tread
Can't get angry with the angels
They're so difficult to find
There's a club they call heaven
But your credit card's declined
You might also likeGetting close to the edge
Hanging by a silver thread
You tried to climb a mountain
Now you're climbing walls insteadEmbed
