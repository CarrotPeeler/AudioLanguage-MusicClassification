1 ContributorMaple Boy LyricsCrash course in death
With every single breath
A shallow broken whisper comes to mind
A raspy “goodbye now” the last words left behind
A little withered but mostly weathered
A legend that chose to nurture the bottom
And now in it’s place a legacy of full grown trees
One that i am proud to say i’ll be
Young trees rise up from the bottom
Doing what the old one’s taught ‘em
From a world away i can hear your leaves everyday
From a world away i can hear your leaves everyday
And with one last tractor ride a slow blue through the green and brown
A boy with a heavy heart and mind
With every tool and every skill he had to look inside himself
To find the one to change direction
It was an classic reaction for one raised by the master
Young trees rise up from the bottom
Using what the old ones taught ‘em
From a world away i can hear your leaves everyday
From a world away i can hear your leaves everyday
Anchorless seeds still stuck in the weeds and i can't believe it
Tell me only say good things and i will complete it
Drifting seeds still stuck in the weeds and i can't believe it
Tell me only say good things and i will complete it
Young trees rise up from the bottom
Doing what the old one’s taught ‘em
From a world away i can hear your leaves everyday
From a world away i can hear your leaves everydayYou might also likeEmbed
