You know somebody been talkin' 'bout poor me
Oh Miss Glory B, Miss Glory B
You know somebody been talkin' 'bout poor me
Yeah, why do you wanna treat me so bad?
Ooh Lord I just can't see
Yeah, you know I try to treat you
Your body right
My doorbell started ringin' in the morning
It rings all night
Something wrong
Woman, I just can't see
Yeah, I don't bother nobody
But they're all time talkin' about meYou might also likeEmbed
