1 ContributorKing & queen LyricsI could be the king
You should be the queen
If I could be a cannibal
You should be some green
1, 2, 3, 4, 5 more times
Suck my tongue
Hold my head over worries
1, 2, 3, 4, 5 more times
King and queen
Dividing a dillinger
If I could be a wolf
You should be the moon
If I could be an animal
You should be a zooYou might also likeEmbed
