Tonight we'll swing till the morning light
C'mon over your all invited to see
My baby dancing with me
Now I've been a singer for most of my life
I've had money and I've been poor
I've played my guitar to hand full of friends
And heard them shout for more
But through it all
I get so lonely
I miss my woman's velvet touch so much
Hello happiness goodbye loneliness
Tonight we'll swing till the morning light
C'mon over your all invited to see
My baby dancing with me
Too many years have been spent on the road
Now I've lost the heart to play
There's only one thing that I want from this life
To be home and home to stay
No more waiting for the mailman
No more lonely lonely nights thats right
Hello happiness goodbye loneliness
Tonight we'll swing till the morning light
C'mon over your all invited to see
My baby dancing with me
