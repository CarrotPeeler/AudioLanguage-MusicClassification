1 ContributorOne in Seven Billion Girl LyricsYou’ve the attraction of
A neutron star
You will always draw me in
No matter from how far
I wanna be with you
Till the world melts away
You know that you’re my universe
It’s like I always say
That on my planet you’re a one
On my planet you’re a one in seven
On my planet you’re a one in seven billion girl
On my planet you’re a one in seven billion girl
The sunshine of your love
Is interplanetary
I wanna study you
You are such a rarity
I would give up my wings to help you fly
I would reduce my thrust to help you keep the sky
I would jettison myself
Just to make you more light
That tether’s shorter than regular
I hope you’re right
The absence of your love
Is like a big black hole
No matter there’s no time
Gone or invisibleYou might also likeEmbed
