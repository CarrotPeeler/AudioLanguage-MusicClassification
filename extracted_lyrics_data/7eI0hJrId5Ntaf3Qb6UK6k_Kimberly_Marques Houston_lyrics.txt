4 ContributorsKimberly Lyrics
Kimberly, I'm so glad you made it
You're finally here
If these walls could talk they'll tell you secrets
Of how I've been anticipating you
I know you want me to satisfy ya
And to gratify your desires
Your body's whispering to my soul
Telling me to take control

Come along with me 'cause my ride don't stop
We can make love that the neighbors watch
Open up the blinds, let the whole world see
MH and Kimberly
Baby, I can take you to that place
Where you can freely scream, touch and taste
I can make your fantasy reality, Kimberly
Kimberly

You're crawling on my bed, climbing close to me
And I can hardly breathe, 'cause I still can't believe
Laid your hand on my chest, gently lifting your knees
Slowly started grinding
Hot, hot, destination ecstasy
First class tickets to it
No time for frontin', do it
Your tears got your eyeliner running down your face
You're so sexy, I can feel your body shake
The ceiling fan's spinning and the lights is low
I got frequent flyer mileage
(Are you really ready?) Ooh (Come on)
The ceiling fan's spinning and the lights is low
(Lights is low)
I got frequent flyer mileage
There's no limit to how far I might go
I know to explore is the key
Oh, take me, Kimberly (Kimberly)
You might also like
Come along with me 'cause my ride don't stop
(My ride don't stop with your good love)
We can make love that the neighbors watch
(Let the neighbors watch us)
Open up the blinds, let the whole world see
MH and Kimberly
Baby, I can take you to that place
Where you can freely scream, touch and taste
I can make your fantasy reality, Kimberly
Kimberly


(Anytime you want me)
Anytime you want me, baby
(Anytime you want me, baby)
I'll be your playboy (Oh, oh, oh yeah)
Anytime you're feeling lonely, baby
(Anytime you feel lonely, baby)
I'll be there to fill the void
(It's like the call of the wild, oh baby)
It's like the call of the wild when we're making love
More than just physical
(It's more than just physical, Kimberâ€”)
Deep inside of every woman there's a Kimberly
(Kimberly, oh, ho)
She's incredible (She's incredible, you know)
Come along with me 'cause my ride don't stop
(Come with me, oh-oh)
We can make love that the neighbors watch
(Let 'em watch, girl, I want 'em to see)
Open up the blinds, let the whole world see
MH and Kimberly
(MH and Kimberly, that's what they wanna see, no)
Baby, I can take you to that place
(I can take you there)
Where you can freely scream, touch and taste
(Touch and taste)
I can make your fantasy reality, oh, Kimberly
Kimberly (Yeah)

Ooh, y'all don't even wanna know what happened with that shit
Song says it all, man
