4 ContributorsWhile I’ve Got It on My Mind Lyrics
Laying around home with a ball game on
Feeling fairly fine
Blackberry jam is cooking in the pan
And the jam and the cook are mine
I like my honey from the hives of home
And berries from my old vine

And I like to get my loving
While I got it on my mind

My dog is asleep at my bare feet
It's a good day for laying around
Just her and me and it's Saturday
Everybody's gone to town
We've been working hard and she gets tired
That puts me in a bind

Because I like to get my loving
While I got it on my mind

Then she looks at me and I can see
That old familiar look
And the jam is sweet as she lowers the heat
To give it time to cook
Then I lock the door and across the floor
To my queen of woman kind
You might also like
Yeah, I like to get my loving
While I got it on my mind

Now boys don't you be ramble and free
And leaving the girls to cry
Because  the nights get cold and there isn’t no gold
That'll ever satisfy
And there isn’t no joy that'll come to you boys
Like the kind I've known at times
When I go right on in that lover
While I got in on my mind

Yeah, I like to get my loving
While I got in on my mindEmbed
