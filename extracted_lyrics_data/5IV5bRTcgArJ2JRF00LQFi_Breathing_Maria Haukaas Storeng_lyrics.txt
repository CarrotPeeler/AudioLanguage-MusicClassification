I was sinking like a stone
Like a ship wreck's stranded hours all alone
Saying always well
So no one else could tell
Heavy shackles round my feet
Getting ready for the next defeat
But somehow you came stumbling into my life
And made me realize
And now my feet are lifted slowly from the ground
I'm breathing
No, nothing holds me down
I'm breathing
I thought that I would drown
I'm breathing
I'm still breathing
It's kinda funny how things change
And how I'm free at last
From all these chains
And how this weight upon my shoulders disappeared
With you just being here

I'm breathing
No, nothing holds me down
I'm breathing
I thought that I would drown
I'm breathing
I'm still breathing
Once the dark was all I knew
Now the sky is turning blue
I see it, I feel it
My world's turned around
And I'm breathing
I was lost and now I'm found
My feet don't touch the ground
(I'm breathing)
No, nothing holds me down
(I'm breathing)
I thought that I would drown
(I'm breathing)
I'm still breathing
I'm still breathing
(I'm breathing)
(Breathing)
My world is turning round
(I'm breathing)
I'm still breathing
I'm breathingEmbed
