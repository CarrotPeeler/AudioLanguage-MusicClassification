All of my life, too late
'Til you showed up with perfect timing
Now here we are, you rock it
Our fingers are stuck in the socket

It's just a nature, a game
Get ready, we'll do it again
Let's not recover from the hangover
When your eyes got me drunk, I was sober
See Shakira LiveGet tickets as low as $50You might also like
Is it true that you love me?
I dare you to kiss me
With everyone watchin'
It's truth or dare on the dance floor

La, la, la-la-la

You're the one who's keepin' me on it
You know I like you, ain't nobody's business
Your blue Spanish eyes are my witness

It's just a nature, a game
Get ready, we'll do it again
