10 ContributorsSeven Seas Lyrics
Stab a sorry heart with your favourite finger
Paint the whole world blue and stop your tears from stinging
Hear the cavemen singing
Good news, they're bringing

Seven seas, swimming them so well
Glad to see my face among them, kissing the tortoise shell

A longing for some fresher feeling
Belonging or just forever kneeling
Where is the sense in stealing
Without the grace to be it?

Seven seas, swimming them so well
Glad to see my face among them, kissing the tortoise shell

Burning my bridges and smashing my mirrors, turning to see if you're cowardly
Burning the witches with mother religious, you'll strike the matches and shower me
In water games, washing the rocks below
Taught and tamed, in time with tear flow
You might also like
Seven seas, swimming them so well
Glad to see my face among them, kissing the tortoise—
Seven seas, swimming them so well
Glad to see my face among them, kissing the tortoise—
Seven seas, swimming them so well
Glad to see my face among them, kissing the tortoise shell2Embed
