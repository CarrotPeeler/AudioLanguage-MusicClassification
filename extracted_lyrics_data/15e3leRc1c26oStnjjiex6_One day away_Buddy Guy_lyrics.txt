4 ContributorsOne Day Away LyricsEvery moment has a meaning
And time is a precious thing
When we wake up in the morning
Who knows what it's gonna bring?
Life rearranges
All of our best laid plans
Better say what's in your heart
You might not get another chance
So tell them you love them
And do it today
Don't wait for tomorrow
Don't wish one day away
Don't wish one day away, oh no
If you've taken folks for granted
Think they'll always be around
It's too late to say you're sorry
When they're sleeping in the ground
So tell them you love them
And do it today
Don't wait for tomorrow
Don't wish one day away
Don't wish one day away
You might also likeOf all the things we left undone
For the words we've meant to say
What if we could all have just one more day?
Yeah, yeah, yeah
So tell them you love them
And do it today
Don't wait for tomorrow
Don't wait for tomorrow
Don't wait for tomorrow
Don't wish one day away
No, no, no, no, no, no
Don't wish one day awayEmbed
