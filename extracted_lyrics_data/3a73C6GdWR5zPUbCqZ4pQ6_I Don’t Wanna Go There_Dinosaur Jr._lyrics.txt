7 ContributorsI Donâ€™t Wanna Go There Lyrics
I don't wanna go there
I don't wanna go there anymore
I don't wanna go there
I don't wanna go there anymore
'Cause I'm gone, 'cause I'm gone

You're the one who told me
You're the one who told me what to say
Would you come and hold me?
Would you come and show me right away?
'Cause I'm gone, 'cause I'm gone

And the world it spins around you, I believe it
And the world it really needs you, now I see it
And the world it spins around you, I believe it
And the world it really needs you, now I see it

I don't wanna waste it
I don't wanna waste it anymore
Can you help me face it?
Help me 'fore I run right for the door
And I'm gone, I'm gone
You might also like
Should I walk alone?
Should I take it home? Should I tear?
It's not gonna go, it's not gonna go well
'Cause I'm gone, 'cause I'm gone
'Cause I'm gone, 'cause I'm gone

And the world it spins around you, I believe it
And the world it really needs you, now I see it
And the world it spins around you, I believe it
And the world it really needs you, now I see it1Embed
