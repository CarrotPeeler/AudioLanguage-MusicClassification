Get over here
I'm down on the floor
I'm ready to go
I'm down on the floor
I'll give all I got
Get over here
Get over here
Get over here
Not gonna come over here
Depending on you
To come to my side
Get on the floor
Oh get on the floor
Get over here
Get over here
Get over here
Get over here
Get over here
Get over here
Get over here
Get over here
Get over here
Get over hereYou might also likeEmbed
