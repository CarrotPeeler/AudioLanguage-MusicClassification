Highway of Light
Lights the way
Into the night
Puts all flesh
All human spirit
To rest

The clatter and the clang
The bells we rang
The sound of wheels
I've got a fresh set of ears
And they ain't listening
Oh no

But soon it all appears in vain
Even the rain
It will stop
My eyes are black
My jealous dry
And I feel nothing
No more

Headlights penetrate the wall
Of darkness that surround it all
We chase the highway on and on
Tonight the highway is our home
You might also like
Highway of Light
Deliver me
To the night
That we might sleep
And disappear
No-one may ever
Find us here

An endless string of lights
Meanders through the night
Through houses with gaping doors
Where no-one's living any more

Highway of Light
Lights the way
Into the night
Puts all flesh
All human spirit
To restEmbed
