You brought two too many

I don't want to be a hero, all I want is the money
That turd, dressed in black, rode herd on me, the whole damn night
Sweetwater?...I'd hate to call that stinking piece of desert Sweetwater
You.  Take it
No no  no
Pull for you, you lazy bunch of greasers!
You think they'd get off their asses to help us, the bastards?  Hell no
???????
That to me is the bull shit
They have a long way
Pull for you, you lazy bunch of greasers!
Orale muevanse
I don't want to be a hero, all I want is the money
There he is
Dead or aliveYou might also likeEmbed
