Is like climbing upstairs to reach a basement
While you were searching for mirrors
To find a place to stare
Your ideology lost it's step
It's not based on reality
You stepped on the wrong train
And you became who
You would ordinarily shame
Face it
When you want to run i'd rather crawl
God forbid you change on my account
Like i said before
I won't lend my words to prosperity
I know we all change
But your rhetoric is extraordinarily tame
If time can change you
To feel profound
About counting value
Better you
Yes better you than me
Face it
No more explanations accept that your lifestyle

While you ewre searching for mirrors

Your ideology lost it's step
It's not based on reality
I know we all change
But your rhetoric is extraordinarily tame
If time can change you
To feel profound
About counting value
Better you
Yes better you than me
Fact it
