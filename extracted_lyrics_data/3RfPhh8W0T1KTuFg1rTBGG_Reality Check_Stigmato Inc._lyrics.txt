1 ContributorReality check LyricsSo you have to get it down/done with the deal
Unmask the face to reveal
The real what you feel
You and/in your every day situations
All the unnecessary complications
Yes you better get it down/done with the deal
Unmask the face to reveal
The real what you feel
Bad or right
Sad sight
Tonight
Try, try, try, try, try...You might also likeEmbed
