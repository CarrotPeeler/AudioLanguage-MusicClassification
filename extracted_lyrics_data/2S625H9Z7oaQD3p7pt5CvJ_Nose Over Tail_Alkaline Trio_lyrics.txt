9 ContributorsNose Over Tail Lyrics
Cracked my head open on your kitchen floor
To prove to you that I have brains
Meanwhile, tin men are led by little girls
Down golden roads that lead to nowhere

Fine time to fake a seizure to feel your mouth on mine
You're saving me

Whatever happened to that silly dream you had?
I want to make it real, I'd love to rub your back
Like a plane crash that never hits the ground
I fall in love with you, I'm nose over tail for you

Your voice like the sound of sirens to a house on fire
You're saving meYou might also like1Embed
