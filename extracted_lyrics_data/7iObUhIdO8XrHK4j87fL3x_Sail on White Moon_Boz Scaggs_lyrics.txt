2 ContributorsSail on White Moon LyricsYour world was not the kind
I ever thought I'd find
Myself to be a part of
Oh, but here I stand
In the middle of a foreign land
A stranger with love in his heart
Mmmmm, for love has no eyes
It comes in no disguise
It's free for those who want to share
And I've chosen you to be mine
So girl let's not waste no time
Let's not worry 'bout what they say
Let's take care of what is ours today
Sail on white moon
Across the dark and starry sky
Sail on white moon
Our love won't die
But girl you must realize
There be a difference in our lives
We're gonna be rejected
Oh, but that's to be expected

Across the dark and starry sky
Sail on white moon
Across the dark and starry skyEmbed
