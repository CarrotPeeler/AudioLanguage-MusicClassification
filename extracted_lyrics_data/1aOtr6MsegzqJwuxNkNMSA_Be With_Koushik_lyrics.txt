2 ContributorsBe With Lyrics
Is this sunlight I do see
When I'm left with you
If I could tell you with just one thing
That's all I'd have to do

My eyes
Be with you

Can't forget this time I've left
It's all I've left to see
If I could stare out into one
You'd be only with me

My eyes
Be with you
My eyes
Be with you

Ooh
