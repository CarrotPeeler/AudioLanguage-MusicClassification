5 ContributorsSad Girl Lyrics
(Sad girl)
You look so sad
Did he break your heart?
Gee, that's too bad
I guess now you see
Ooh, how love could be
Sad girl
Forget that guy
Come on, let's smile now
Please won't you try?

Get a hold of yourself
Come on and
Find you someone else
(Open up) Open up your heart, girl
(Open up) We can make a brand new start
(Open up) Please don't cry
Just go out and find yourself another guy

(Sad girl)
Hold your head up high
Things are gonna change, I know
As time goes by
Because that's the way it goes
Everybody knows
Everybody's somebody's fool
And you're no exception to the rule
Your day's gonna come, I know
All you gotta do is keep on smilingYou might also likeEmbed
