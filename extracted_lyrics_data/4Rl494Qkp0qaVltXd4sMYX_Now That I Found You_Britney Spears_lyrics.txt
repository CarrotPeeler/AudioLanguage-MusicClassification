20 ContributorsNow That I Found You Lyrics
On a shameless night, in a nameless place
I thought that love was a hopeless case
'Til I found you
'Til I found you
Lived a wasteful life in a hateful city
There was no love just pain and pity
'Til I found you
'Til I found you

And you don't know how you saved me
And you don't know what you gave me
And you don't know how you saved my life

I can see the light
I have flown away
I have come alive
I am blown away
I have felt the love
I can see the truth
Now that I found you
Now that I found you
I can live my life
I believe in faith
I have found myself
I have lost the hate
I have felt the love
I can see the truth
Now that I found you
Now that I found you
You might also like
On a shameless night, in a nameless place
I thought that love was a hopeless case
'Til I found you
'Til I found you
Lived a wasteful life in a hateful city
There was no love just pain and pity
'Til I found you
'Til I found you

And you don't know how you saved my life

I can see the light
I have flown away
I have come alive
I am blown away
I have felt the love
I can see the truth
Now that I found you
Now that I found you

All my life I've waited for this day
Have waited for you, now I adore you
All my life I've waited for this day
Have waited for you, now I adore you
I can see the light
I have flown away
I have come alive
I am blown away
I have felt the love
I can see the truth
Now that I found you
Now that I found you4Embed
