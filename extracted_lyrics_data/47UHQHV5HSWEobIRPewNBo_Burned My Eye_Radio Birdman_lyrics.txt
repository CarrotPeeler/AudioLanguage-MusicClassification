1 ContributorBurned My Eye Lyrics
Seen your plane comin' down
Seen your friends they was hangin' round
Seen your face in a can of beer
I saw your mama in a coupe de ville, well

Burned my eye
Burned my mind
Couldn’t believe it I ain’t lyin' no, yeah yeah yeah
Oh no, hey

Seen a real O-mind last night
Seen a real great band all right
Heard sounds burning up my eye
Raw power vaporise my mind, well

Burned my eye
Burned my mind
Couldn’t believe it I ain’t lyin' no, yeah yeah yeah
Oh yeah

I seen your fist upside my head
Seen your dog messin' up my bed
I saw your eyes burnin' in the dark
I operated on your heart, well
You might also like
Burned my eye
Burned my mind
Couldn’t believe it I ain’t lyin' no, yeah yeah yeah
Yeah, uh
No, no, no (hey)
Hey, rip it all outEmbed
