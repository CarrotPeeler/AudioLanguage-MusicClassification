8 ContributorsBetter Than You Lyrics
I can do it better than, better than you
Better than, better than you

I can tell that you're watching me
And I know you're loving everything that you see
The way I got you going crazy
I'll make you wanna dance with me
And now I'm walking 'round like I just don't care
Got everybody looking like I'm a true player
So what's up? So what's up?

I see you staring
But I ain't mad at that
Why don't you do you
And I'll do me right back

You ready to go? (Oh)
Sure you wanna play this game?
I can do it better than, better than you
I can do it better than, better than you
So, baby, let's go, (Oh)
I know you won't forget about me
I can do it better than, better than you
I can do it better than, better than you
You might also like
So you get what you see with me
Take a picture but you ain't getting 3D
Boy, slow down, come here
I'ma make you sing for me
So you say that you're better than me
If I take it all off, bet you'd like what you see
So what's up? What's up? Yeah, yeah

I see you staring
But I ain't mad at that
Why don't you do you
And I'll do me right back

You ready to go? (Oh)
Sure you wanna play this game?
I can do it better than, better than you
I can do it better than, better than you
So, baby, let's go, (Oh)
I know you won't forget about me
I can do it better than, better than you
I can do it better than, better than you

I can see ya
Losing your mind, yeah
'Cause we about to set this off right, yeah
I can see ya
Losing your mind, yeah
'Cause we about to set this off right
I can see ya
Losing your mind, no
You ready to go? (Oh)
Sure you wanna play this game?
I can do it better than, better than you
I can do it better than, better than you
So, baby, let's go, (Oh)
I know you won't forget about me
I can do it better than, better than you
I can do it better than, better than you
