Sing something before I go
He said he'd be here
But he didn't show
So sing something that I know
I've missed the last train
It did not wait
Now I'm abandoned to my fate
So sing something that I know
Sing something sad and slow
The bar is closing
They want me out
I came here with joy
I leave without
So sing something that I know
Sing something sad and slowYou might also likeEmbed
