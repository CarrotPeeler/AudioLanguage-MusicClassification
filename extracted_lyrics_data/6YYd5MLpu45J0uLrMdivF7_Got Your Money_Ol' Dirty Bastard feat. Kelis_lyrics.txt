57 ContributorsGot Your Money Lyrics
Oh baby, mm (Baby, I eat the shit from right out-out your ass)
It's dedicated to all the pretty girls, all the pretty girls (To allâ€”)
All the pretty girls in the world, um, and the ugly girls too
'Cause to me, you're pretty anyway, baby

You give me your number, I'll call you up
You act like your pussy on interrupt
I don't have no trouble with you fuckin' me
But I have a little problem with you not fuckin' me (Ha)
Baby, you know I'ma take care of you
'Cause you say you got my baby, and I know it ain't true
Is it a good thing? No it's bad, bitch
For good or worse, makes you switch
So I walk on over with my Cristal
Bitch-ass niggas, put away your pist-als
Dirty won't be havin' it in this house
'Cause, bitch, I'll cripple your style
Now that you heard my charmin' voice
You couldn't get another nigga, your coochie won't get moist
If you wanna look good and not be bummy
Girl, you better give me that money (Ooh)

Hey, Dirty (Uh-huh, uh-uh-huh)
Baby, I got your money
Don't you worry, I said hey
Baby, I got your money (Uh, uh, uh, uh)
Hey, Dirty (I said uh-uh, uh, uh, yo)
Baby, I got your money (Said ah-uh-uh, uh, uh, ah)
Don't you worry, I said hey (Uh-uh, uh, uh)
Baby, I got your money (Uh, uh-uh)

Yo, so I glanced at the girl, girl glanced at me
I whispered in her ear, "You wanna be with me?"
You wanna look pretty though, in my video
Ol' Dirty on the hat and I let you all know
Just dance if you caught up in the holy ghost trance
If you stop, I'ma put the killer ants in your pants
I'm the O.D.B. as you can see
F.B.I., don't you be watchin' me
I don't want no problems 'cause I'll put you down
In the ground where you cannot be found
I'm just Dirt Dog tryna make some money
So give me my streaks and give me my honey
Radios play this all day, everyday
Recognize I'm a fool and you love me
None of you, NUH, better look at me funny
NUH, you know my name, now give me my money

Hey, Dirty (Sing it)
Baby, I got your money (Sing it, girls)
Don't you worry, I said hey (Just shake it right now)
Baby, I got your money (If Dirty want his money)
Hey, Dirty (I think y'all should give him his money)
Baby, I got your money (That's how I like it, girl)
Don't you worry, I said hey
Baby, I got your money
Sexy, sexy, sexy, ah
Sexy, sexy, sexy, ah-ah
Sexy, sexy, sexy, ah

Yo, yo, nigga, play it in the club like this all night
Bitches, put your ass out, let me hold it tight
You lookin' at my wrist sayin', "It's so nice" (Nah, nah, nah)
The price, bitch, is diamonds, shining disco lights
Well, you better help me solve my problem
Or I'ma get this money and robbed them
Lucky dog when I won the lotto
Ran up on my car for carryin' Rollo
But hold on, you can call me Dirty (Yuh)
And then lift up your skirt
And you want some of this Dirty
God made Dirt, and Dirt bust your ass (Nah)
Stop annoyin' me, yeah, I play my music loud
It takes the Bastard, Ol' Dirty to move the crowd
They say, "He had his dick in his mouth"
Eddie Murphy taught me that back in the house
Now give me my money

Hey, Dirty (You don't know me)
Baby, I got your money
Don't you worry, I said hey
Baby, I got your money
Hey, Dirty (I wanna be here, sexy sexy, sexy)
Baby, I got your money
Don't you worry, I said hey (Sexy sexy, sexy)
Baby, I got your money (For you)
Hey, Dirty (Sexy sexy, sexy)
Baby, I got your money (Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo)
Don't you worry, I said hey (Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo)
Baby, I got your money (Now give me my money)
Hey, Dirty (Give me my money)
Baby, I got your money (I need my money)
Don't you worry, I said hey
Baby, I got your money
