3 ContributorsScreams in the Night Lyrics
All alone as the night takes the day
Two young lovers park to get away
That noise you heard?  Oh, it's just in your head
Little do you know you're gonna wind up dead

Look behind you, he's corning to get you
With his axe in his hands

Screams in the night
Screams in the night
Screams in the night
Screams in the night

The beast is charged and he's ready to go
Swings his axe with one fatal blow
You look in horror, and you start to pray
Nothing left to do but just try to get away

Look behind you, he's corning to get you
With his axe in his hands
You might also like
Screams in the night
Screams in the night
Screams in the night
Screams in the night


Screams in the night
Screams in the night
Screams in the night
Screams in the nightEmbed
