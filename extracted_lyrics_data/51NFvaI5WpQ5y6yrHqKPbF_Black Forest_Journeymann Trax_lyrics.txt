Project Blowed
Rhymesayers
Living Legends
Independent music

Yeah, the Midwest's finest, amid the best rhymers
Peasants in my presence, address me as your highness
Never been the one to debate who the flyest
Or who shoot the most, or who get the highest
My level of rap remain intact for a decade
Two classics dropped, my art rank among the best made
Print, I swing sound just like a switchblade
Aim it at your face, give that ass a quick fade

Yes I'm from the C.I., got my Illinois up
Yes I'm in a crew, but really I'm in a boys club
Real talk, I better be stacking my blessings
Cause I got a really good deal, and deals bring lessons
A regular dame met a nice dude, spit rounds for the brother
He said "I like you, come join my mighty crew"
And even though they rarely play her
I'm a player, the queen of Rhymesayers
You might also like
I'm still singing the late night blues
Roaming the West Coast, tryna make these moves
Started out with 18 dudes
Headshots the crew, late the name ring through
I'm down with the A-Team too
Me and Abstract Rude in a Cadillac Coupe
On the road tryna grab that loot
Red black green in some black strap boots

Vanglorious co-founder of the Blowed notorious
Next I was the X-Clan of the Battle Axe Warriors
West threw down that bloody axe and started rhyme saying
Now I'm slaying these chicken liver niggas in the frying pan
I saute em 'til I can't taste em, I 'cause mayhem
I flambe em, I lambaste em
The translation, they can't face em, I pancake em
I lost patience, they got wasted

The frisbee turned into a boomerang
From the L.B.C. maneuver, the slang
LMNO's the name, Visionaries the crew
Since the Tribe was Unique, been rocking with Ab Rude
Bless up, that dude's one of the best, easy
You can see and hear for yourself, witness, believe me
'Til the next go around you can find me in the sound
Walls of separation only good for tearing down
Neb Luv, L.B.C., Jah Skills, Warren G
Def Jam, N.Y.C., Unit 5 reality
Back then kept the kush on the deck
Hit the Good Life a few times just to get respect
Polly with the Mass Men, we knocked out seeking
And set it off with the heist that's when the crew was peaking
Wheels up, yeah, we off on tour
Hit Europe 3 times, hood stars for sure

All of us were monsters first before the Blowed sponsored us
Killer Cali King, far as concrete, I'm a conqueror
Crenshaw's Obama, yeah, choke hold a local artist
Then I turn they cypher into my oval office
Rappers better off with Jodeci boots
Or singing topless, or bringing homage
Fuck yo couch, Oscar the Grouch, feed me garbage
I'm Otherwize on Florence with influence
Blak Forest founding fathers

Can only promise a sucker pain, I'm Clubber Lang
Or I'm Sutter Cane how every quote drive a slut insane
Cause life's a bitch but me and these niggas runnin' train
So if you're on the track, step back or select another lane
Duck a fade or tuck your chain before they find you
By the Cecil stuck on Main with stomach pains
It's boulevard billions bitch, you know the fucking name
Service 4-3, easy money gang, nothing changed
See the Blowed, Swim Team, Hellfyre, you read that
Started way before when they was rockin' a red cap
Back at Hamilton had the clouds where my head's at
Midnight Records where the soldier was breathed at
Got a lot of homies and I'm on many teams
Seen so many circles and I seen so many scenes
Kick ya ass with pizzazz and the bars man they so extreme
Gotta thank having this style to my upbringing

We the last sons of the Blowed, no orphanage
8 Neos and each has a Morphius
Soloists cliqued like neocon globalists
Hand to hand, hustle or campaign promo pics
Swim Team, indie the old fashioned way
From Rae's "Faster Blade" to A-Team's "Maskaraid"
Inspired by outliers
So R.I.P. to G-Black and peace to the outsiders

I used to work at Fred Segal
Now I'm just killing the beats from Ken Segal
Came in the rap scene at sixteen
Young dread, clean with freezing the 16's
Went to the Blowed to test the rhymes
Got served a lot but I progressed with time
Explored different scenes, changed my perspective
Then it put me on a whole separate grind

The holy poet keeps it vicious and nutritious out in Pyramid City
A buff buffet, I got infinite bars with me
Jah love all day, my Imperial Guard's with me
I'm satellite high, I got Sirius stars with me
AK-day mix and Queen Anne Park equipped me
Now it's Blowed and B-L, y'all officially gone fishing
Dr. Oop's world class, don't sleep on me family, or fuck it
Wait 'till I pass and holler 'Grammy' at the Grammy's
Either way

It's Luck, I'm chilling
Living Legends, Youtube a few million
I'm a Journeyman, built it from the floor to ceiling
We should probably write a book show 'em how to kill it
Naw, youngstas don't want that
Some rock show's Vox be on track
That's whack, dude, put that on my tattoos
Bad dude we done been around the world too

Sunspot Jonz, you better watch the real throne
Mystik Journeymen from the Living Legends
Occupation: Killer --- assassination flow
West Coast in here releasing your soul
Fuck the radio praising dumb assholes
And down to battle, get ya at your damn show
Promoters and vultures, you're now an organ donor
To this 4-track king coming out of California

As the Earth turns around the sun and I begin my final push
You will begin to see the one without talking to burning bush
The one being the wonderful ways the planet shifts into the next phase
Resume demonstrate my embodiment of monumental speech instruction
Fluctuation of tongue create magic
Havoc and peace and the same time so spastic
Yet so always in control and chemistry soothing
Always Legendary, I'm always in the mix

There's an MC flowing deep and wide and I
Can't stop rising with the tide tonight
Stopped at a slow light, survived the drive
Momma these lions gonna ride or die
Yep, all I need is a paint coat
To rejuvenate, marinate, no scapegoat
Codename: Grouch --- never be torn again
Oh yes, God bless the Scorpion1Embed
