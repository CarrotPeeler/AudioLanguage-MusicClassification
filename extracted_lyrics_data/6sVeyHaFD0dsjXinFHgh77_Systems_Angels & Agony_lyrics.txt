1 ContributorSystems LyricsAbsolute faith in technology
Science, the new religion
Temples filled with hardware
Men in white and no vision
Concrete jungles fill the globe
Economy, the main obsession
Cities turned into ashes
Men in grey and no opinion
Come with me
Escape this reality
Come flee with me
Away from insanity
Passive people in the streets
Indifference, the new disease
Hands covered with blood
Men in green and no compassion
Watchful children skill their mind
Wisdom, the new ambition
Worlds transform into brighter light
Men with full perceptionYou might also likeEmbed
