3 ContributorsThings to Come Lyrics
War between races, war between lines
War between something that lays out deep inside
The deadliest one, come blazing and identified
Yeah, how many must leave, before we realize?
And I say, how many must leave, before we realize?

I caught a glimpse, I caught a glimpse of things to come
I was jolted, I caught a glimpse of things to come
One man stops and launches an explosion
I caught a glimpse of things to come

It falls on you and it falls on me
Outside the church the streets are wet, it's a half past three
Well you get your moves all steady â€™cause no good is up again
Mortally wounded, blood on the front seat, it's the beginning of the end
And God bless the dead, and the family and friends

I caught a glimpse, I caught a glimpse of things to come
I was jolted, I caught a glimpse of things to come
One man stops and launches an explosion
I caught a glimpse of things to comeYou might also likeEmbed
