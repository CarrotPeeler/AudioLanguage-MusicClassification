1 ContributorEverybody’s Somebody’s Fool Lyrics
Ladies, ladies, and women all over the world
I know you understand where I'm coming from
Right here, right now, ri-ri-ri-ri-right now
Oh yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah
We all know this girl

Here we go with the trick questions
They bring up to bring down confidence
Always throw out a sly comment
Like, is your man faithful?
What time does he get home?
Don't worry, I ain't going to need your help
I'm going to watch y'all go home by yourself
A lil' bit of my man's sweet love
Is a whole lot better than none

Don't you know that everybody's somebody's fool
You watch somebody running game
But you never have a clue
Somebody's breaking every rule but it's always cool
Don't you know that everybody's somebody's fool
Hear me now
You might also like
Skip the drama, use common sense
You don't have love if you don't have patience
He's out in the street, yeah, but don't forget
My twice a week and that almighty paycheck
See, I don't even sweat it, I get so much happiness
If I just put up with a lil' bit a bullshit
A lil' bit of my man's sweet love
Is a whole lot better than none

Don't you know that everybody's somebody's fool
You watch somebody running game
But you never have a clue
Somebody's breaking every rule but it's always cool
Don't you know that everybody's somebody's fool
Oh yeah, yeah

(Think no evil) when somebody comes home
(Hear no evil) I don't want to know
(See no evil) I just want to see love
Because somebody always takes care of everybody's wants
Don't interrogate 'bout how he spends his spare time
Whatever he chooses to do is fine, yes it is
'Cause in my heart I believe he's all mine
'Cause you think I can't see
Doesn't mean that I'm blind
Don't you know that everybody's somebody's fool
You watch somebody running game
But you never have a clue
Somebody's breaking every rule but it's always cool
Everybody's somebody's fool
Don't you know that everybody's somebody's fool
You watch somebody running game
But you never have a clue
Somebody's breaking every rule but it's always cool
Everybody's somebody's fool
Everybody's somebody's fool
You watch somebody running game
But you never have a clue (smooth, ain't he?)
He's breaking every rule but it's always cool
Don't you know that everybody's somebody's fool
Listen, girl, you better learn thisEmbed
