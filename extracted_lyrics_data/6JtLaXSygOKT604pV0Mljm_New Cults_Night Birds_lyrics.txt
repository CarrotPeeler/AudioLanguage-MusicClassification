1 ContributorSome New Highway LyricsOne final train will blow for me
Birds soar in sweet asymmetry
These facts get old but they stay
The facts they will
There's a streak of yellow neon
Running out to those
Old tracks still
Some new highway, some new highway
Some new highway, some new highway cuts through
You can leave this town
But it ain't gonna heal ya
Put away your worn memorabilia
Forget disguises of these pine motel alibis
Put away your wishes with the dishes in a couple tries
Some new highway, some new highway
Somе new highway, some new highway cuts through
Tеll me the story that you guard so well
About a routine life in a pine motel
Somebody asks were the hell you've been
And you say you've been to see the Devil's grin
A basket full of flowers flowing over the rim
Incandescence in a high school gym
And every single street corner will remind me of him
And they're all buckled up and not-so-new
And I don't think there'll be –
Every night in the distance
She hears the sound of cars
Roaring down some new highway
And lemme tell you, it cuts through
It cuts true
– Some new highway
And I don't think there'll be a new road throughYou might also likeEmbed
