Hey, is this thing on?
Uh, uh

I saw him dancin' there by the record machine
I knew he musta been about seventeen
The beat was goin' strong
Playin' my favorite song
I could tell it wouldn't be long
'Til he was with me, yeah, with me
I could tell it wouldn't be long
'Til he was with me, yeah, with me, singin'

I love rock 'n' roll
So put another dime in the jukebox, baby
I love rock 'n' roll
So come on, take some time and dance with me, ow

He smiled, so I got up and asked for his name
"But that don't matter," he said, "'Cause it's all the same"
He said, "Can I take you home where we can be alone?"
And next, we were movin' on
And he was with me, yeah, with me
And we were movin' on and singin' that same ol' song
Yeah, with me, singin'

I love rock 'n' roll, yeah
'Cause it soothes my soul, yeah

Yeah, eh, yeah
I said, "Can I take you home, where we can be alone?"
And next, we were movin' on
And he was with me, yeah, with me
And we were movin' on and singin' that same ol' song
Yeah, with me, singin'
