2 ContributorsIf This House Was Her Heart LyricsShe puts the towels away
Clean and orderly
That’s how she spends her days
Busy as a bee
See how the windows gleam
See how the dishes shine
If you dropped by, you’d say
She must be fine
But if this house was her heart
You’d see papers piling up outside her door
The paint chipping and old stains on every floor
You’d look and say it’s falling apart
If this house was her heart
She spins from room to room
Til all the dust is gone
She keeps the flowers fed
She even mows the lawn
There’s not a door that sticks
She’s oiled every one
The things he used to do
They still get done
But if this house was her heart
You’d see puddles where the rain comes pouring in
Faded wallpaper where pictures might have been
You would swear this place was falling apart
If this house was her heart
You might also likeYou’d see papers piling up outside her door
The paint chipping and old stains on every floor
You’d look and say it’s falling apart
If this house was her heartEmbed
