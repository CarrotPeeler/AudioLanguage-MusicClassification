We face our extinction day after day
Oblivious to what we'll become
Persist to exist in our pathetic ways
Nothing to show when it's done
We take what they give
Complacency, the masses content to consume
The idiots out-breeding twenty to one
Ensuring our future is doomed

We had it all and we pissed it away
Ignoring the signs in our face
Fucking and fighting and drinking all day
Intelligence left in disgrace

Deadlock, mediocracy, deadlock
Deadlock, hypocrisy, deadlock

Standing in line for the latest release
An upgrade to shit we don't need
A fistful of cash and a smile on your face
A wallet just dying to bleed
Take all your money and throw it away
Flush all your work down the drain
Lambs to the slaughter with nothing to say
You see now your life was in vain
You might also like
Deadlock, mediocracy, deadlock
Deadlock, hypocrisy, deadlock

The hits start coming and they don't stop coming
One slip further and you won't stop running
Best get comfy in the hole we're digging
The graveyard's running out of room
The hits start coming and they don't stop coming
One slip further and you won't stop running
Best get comfy in the hole we're digging
The graveyard's running out of room

We face our extinction day after day
The masses content to consume
The fat on the land is all wasting away
The future of life here is doomed

We had it all and we pissed it away
Ignored all the signs in our face
Lambs to the slaughter with nothing to say
We're the fate of our race
Deadlock, mediocracy, deadlock
Deadlock, hypocrisy, deadlock
Deadlock, mediocracy, deadlock
Deadlock, hypocrisy, deadlockEmbed
