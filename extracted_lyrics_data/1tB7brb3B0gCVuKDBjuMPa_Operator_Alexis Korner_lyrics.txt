Oh how I hate to see you go
So long, darlin'
How I hate to see you go
Say good-bye to you baby
Ain't gonna let my happy home
So many sad, sad, sad years
Baby, but I've had my fun
So many sad, sad, sad years
I've had my fun
But the day I met you, darling
All my troubles have begun
I've got to leave you, baby
I don't care what you say
Leave you, darling
Come back home one sunny day
Down the road, down the road I go
I'm going to find myself a little woman
People, people to look after all my cares
So long
Baby, I hate to leave you this way
Baby, baby, so long
I sure do hate to leave this way
But when I come back home, yes
Baby, baby, you'll know I've been awayYou might also likeEmbed
