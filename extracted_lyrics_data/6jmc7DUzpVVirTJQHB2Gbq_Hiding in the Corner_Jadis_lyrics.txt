1 ContributorHiding In The Corner LyricsLocked within a shell
People cry for hours
Climbing walls to get to you
Am I the last thing on your mind
Time is closing in and day by day
No-one left to turn to
No one
Who will tell me stories
Who will make me laugh and cry
Why am I left in this torrent of madness
These tears won't burning from my eyes
From my eyes
From my eyesYou might also likeEmbed
