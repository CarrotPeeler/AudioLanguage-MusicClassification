2 ContributorsThe Lesser Man LyricsLong is the road that I walk upon
Heavy is the load that I bear
Strong is the will that keeps me holding on
I won't be the lesser man
I won't be the one
The lesser man, the lesser man, the lesser
I won't be the one
The lesser man, the lesser man, the lesser man
Time is the price that you have to pay
Lonely is the burden that you may have
Brave is the one that keeps holding on
Keeping the faith the best I can
I won't be the one
The lesser man, the lesser man, the lesser
I won't be the one
The lesser man, the lesser man
This is where I make my stand
The lesser man, the lesser man
I won't be the one
The lesser man
Trying it harder and harder
And do it, you understand
I won't be, I won't be the lesser man
The lesser man
