1 ContributorSedation LyricsSpace and time all fall behind
Strange machines to soothe my mind
Resting this sensory sleep keeps me confined
Recalling a memory undefined
Repressive sedative restraint
The image of myself erased
Distant voices redicate
Colored screenshots will sedate
Following
Into this spiral descent, it is pulling me in
Salvation
Lies on the other sideYou might also likeEmbed
