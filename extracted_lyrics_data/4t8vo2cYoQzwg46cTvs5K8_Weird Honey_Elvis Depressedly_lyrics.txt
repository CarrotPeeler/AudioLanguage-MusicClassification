Bring me to my knees
Her purity fucks with me
Weird honey

Boring ecstasy
Her sacred heart fucks with me
Weird honey

If there's a cool spot in Hell
I hope you get it
If there's a cool spot in Hell
I know you'll get it

Staying up all night
Talking blasphemous ash
Weird honey

Getting off on death
Crashing Heaven's trash
Weird honey

If there's a cool spot in Hell
I hope you get it
If there's a cool spot in Hell
I know you'll get it7Embed
