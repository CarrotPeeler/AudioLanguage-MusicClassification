Well, the crickets get it
And the ants get it
I bet you the pigs get it
Yeah, even the plants get it
Come on now, and get with it
Yeah, I want you to get with it
Oh! Yeah, I just want you to get with it

'Cause every worm that's under your shoe
And every bird and bug in the jungle, too
And everything in the ocean blue
They just happen to know exactly what to do
So why don't you?
Yeah, why don't you?

The flies get it
And the frogs get it
And all them big jungle cats get it
And I bet your little dog gets it
Yeah, I want you to get with it, oh
Yeah, come on and get with it, oh
Whoo! Yeah, yeah, I want you to get with it, yeah
You might also like
'Cause every worm that's under your shoe
And every bird and bee in the jungle, too
And everything in the ocean blue
They just happen to know exactly what to do
So why don't you?
(Why don't you?)

And all the chickens get it
And them singing canaries get it
(Woo! Uh! Whoo!)
And even strawberries get it
And I want you to get with it, yeah
Yeah, I want you to get with it, oh
Yeah! Ah, come on, get with it

'Cause every worm that's under your shoe
And every bird and bee in the jungle, too
And everything in the ocean blue
They just happen to know exactly what to do
So why don't you?Embed
