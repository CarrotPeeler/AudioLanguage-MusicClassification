3 ContributorsArkaic vs Illmaculate Lyrics
I said well, well, well
Look who they found again
Another prick that I might have to clown again
Another Yank that I might have to out again
But he's ballin', sleeping on Bamalam's couch again
Listen, I work harder, this is well deserved karma
For when I got bumped for that money when I was Eurgh's partner
Yo, they put me down, but I rose out of the ashes with burnt armor
Just to blow this fucking Yank out of the water like Pearl Harbour
Listen my brudda, no one laughs at your jokes
I went to your ends, tried to harbor a boat
I had a quick conversation with a guard at the coast
He asked me if I had a green card, I said "No"
Shit, I thought he was going to ask if I smoked
I almost passed him a toke
Cause this is London, and out here we use fucking green card for a roach
So really boy, what bitches do you penetrate?
You can't even get to second base
Your just a midget rude bwoy, you cannot even get a date
But I can tell you everything that I'll bet he says
He'll talk about when I went away, he'll talk about the '07 days
Talk about Steph, it's bait
But lets talk about you, how you you used to be a better name
How you used to be good, how you used to entertain
About how your using Don't Flop as an extra way to extend your stay
And how you only got booked for this battle because you was in the area anyway
So who's the best at it? I got news my brudda its not you
Cause an Illmac bar is like a seventeen year old riding around in a real nice car
I'd rate it, but I don't know who it fucking belongs to
See my man Illmac has got Caustic popping tags
See I heard his third round of this battle, bought him a watch and hat
Plus 'Saurus drops him raps and Okw' was on top of that
Bitch, one of your battle verses is more like a Fresh Coast pussy track
So damn homie, in high school you was the man homie
But I got bigger fish to fry, he's an anchovy
He's   and I'm Fat Tony
This is Marge returning from the shops, "I'm back Homey"
See that's a fact homie, you ain't nothin' but wack homie
And your careers so dead Chronicle won't even book you for BLAM! homie
I bet he thought I would greet him with some sort of open-armed sentiment
Bet he'll come with them "your nose is large" and Noah's Ark references
But I show no regard, I'll let the flow and bars settle this
And if he's a Big Mac, then I'm his golden arch nemesis
Bruv, I am fucking relentless, I ain't stopping this for nutting
Half of me expected him to Math Hoffa it or something
Another Yank treating Don't Flop like a holiday to London
Time
You might also like
Yo, I know that your weapons rappin'
And that, fucking Pearl's Harbour reference crackin'
It's appropriate because If you bomb me it's only cause I let it happen
See, I ain't come to talk about dub RC
You love our rings
I ain't come to talk about how he got arrested
You handled your shit like a man, I respect It
And I hope you come home with more knowledge of self than you left with
But this is what happens when you put a pup near a beast
I don't give a fuck if this cunt fears police
It'll all become clear to see
You'd rather be locked up with them then up here with me
So you ain't snitch right, right?
Then that's how that goes, you're damn straight
I'd do the same thing for my fam' so I can't hate
But you trash flow is mad baked
And against 'Mac it's a mismatch
Like, like, like....that nose and that face
Yeah I question their relationship
You could probably tell me what strain of weed I smoke
And where its made and when, if you care to take a whiff
I would never dare to say you snitch
Shit, remember in that 2 on 2 when Ok' was there and came with Diz'
It wasn't fair, Oshea would spit
You must have had of them flashbacks of those interrogation clips
Where you sit there and claim the fifth
Cause you was barely saying shit
So I don't want to here about a battle that happened like 8 years ago
When your still living in the shadow of rappers I ate years ago
You have the attributes of a rapping mutant
This last year you made mad improvements
But don't let that go to your head
It already looks like an egg that fuckin' hatched a human
I don't give a fuck about the ounces that you hustle
I came to clown you in your bubble
Show how predictable you are to the crowd and you're in trouble
Example, {whispers} show em who's bitch you are
I command you to start your round with a rebuttal
Time!
Yo, my man said my head looks like a cracked egg
Well that's fine, yours does too, but yours hasn't hatched yet
So I'ma catch this body on behalf of Don't Flop Entertainment
See they wrote me off for ages
And if he's out of this world
I'll kill him while he's floating on a spaceship like Dozer in the Matrix
But you should've known I'd box his face in
And give the monkey from Coco Pops a face lift
I'm trying to focus on the basics
Get a bonus in my pay slip, but not him
See, raps is his only occupation
And he's going broke so you know he's phoning all of these promoters up for favors
But if that's the case, this is what happens when i put you under closer observation
And I'd tell you to keep your chin up
But that's the only way you can hold a conversation
Hey yo, a legend is born
This is Brooklyn on December the 4th
I go Ed-a-ward Norton, American X on this dwarf
Foot pressed to the floor with a curb next to his jaw
I get it bruv, I get it, you got no respect for the force
You've broken every single American law
You put the lead in the four, spray it off and then let it explore
But if that's the case, how'd you even get your little legs in the door?
And that's funny, cause you can get into my country but I can't get into yours
And of course, I know he's only ever good when he ever he's with Pete
They stay in hotels and he tickles feathers on his feet
You weren't exactly the strongest member of the team
And anyone that's heard of you and 'Saurus knows your Aldous Snow
You ain't putting on a performance unless you Get Him To The Greek
You lost to PoRICH and Diaz, do you know how waste that is
Your crews called Sandpeople like Star Wars, do you know how gay that is?
Listen, and you ain't getting payed for shit
I mean what are you getting between you, like $200 a night?
And your manager get's 10%, that's like $20 a night
Bruvva, I ain't knocking your grind, I'm fully on for working in the job that you like
But you got that kind of face that says "I'm the one they send to the shops all the time."
And besides
Yo, you want short jokes, fine
He's so short; he looks like he lives in a windmill on a crazy golf course
Fuck it, yo, he's so short we know this ain't incredibly fair
He's so short he needs ladder, just to get up the stairs
And against Arsonal you chocked like a chicken
In your battles you go ''aye, aye", like that's the only consistence
Which makes me think you're a scouser of an alchy that hated the old life he lived in
Either that or your buying batteries and need roadside assistance!
See it's a par because I've been barring, way before his partner get skin grafted
You perform to a bunch of backpackers, you're hardly a big artist
I make him go all types of nuts, like a jar full of mixed almonds
And you're getting bodied overseas like Osama Bin Laden!
Time
So I blacked out against Arsonal, fuckin' A
But you don't have crusty braids and I ain't drunk today
Besides that night was Cool Runnings, obviously someone gave Sanka his lucky egg
See I can roast in my sleep
Cruger's dad told me that weed was gross but it's cheap
Now image all the weed that you sold in the street
Yep, that's what I smoke in a week
I smoke more than you sold
I sold more than you know
I lost more than you made
And made more than you owe
I saved more than you seen
Destroyed more than you grown
You say more than you think
And I think more than you spoke
You complain more than a breeze
Flop more than you flow
Bitch I get paid more than you free
And forgot more than you wrote
Yo, it's Arkaic the lyrical gangsta
He'd rather cipher than have vagina
He don't get along fully with chicks
Cause they don't appreciate proper multis and flips
Now picture him spitting at a bird trying to chill later
But if they ain't seen Juice vs Super Nat would he still date her?
Hell nah that's a deal breaker
I ain't come to talk about your chick getting with me
Cause I bet you feel Worthless since you heard somebody slipped her a Mickey
She swore what she gave you, she wouldn't give up to any
I guess she slipped up with Mickey like a mix up at Disney
If you re-wind this battle, you'll see I gave her an exclusive interview
So if I'm tired, it's only because she blew my inner tube
But your used to getting the door closed on your nose huh
She's probably got hormones like a porno's on
So I might have to stay in that box like getting foreclosed on
See, when you think of all the rappers that allegedly had her
It kind of brings a new meaning to who's Setting The Standard
You pale in comparison and if melanin matters
Tonight's a Full House but being near the spotlight won't make Stephanie Tann-er

Yo, you'll get what's coming to you in due course later
Ayo Eurgh they sayin' revenge is best served cold so I'ma give him his New York flavor
It's lame for you, multi dimensional, cross firing new born lasers
Aye, but that's just what happens when you put Vinnie Jones against a Foosball player
But I see you bangin' it wit' Smack and them
And anyone slightly more  than him he'll prolly try to battle him
But I seen Arsonal batter him, Ness Lee flatten him
Hollow unravel him and Conceited take a grand from him
So if there's any information I can impart back to him
He's gettin' beat by all these black guys he's Kim Kardashian
But let's not forget the fact you're just a Scribble Jam nerd
He's a racist recruiter, I'm white so he's gonna try and give me that work
And this ain't a deniable fact or a rumor
Truth be told brother I prolly should've battled him sooner
But that itch on your side has turned into a cancerous tumor
Cause I just put you in the line of fire like the clock tower in Back To The Future
And brother, I heard you're Native American and that
And I ain't tryin' to embellish on the fact
But stop pretendin' that you're dad ain't rollin' around with a feather in his hat
Go woo woo woo woo woo!
So half of me is sayin', "Give it to him", half of me said, "Chill fam'"
Half of me said, "Do jokes", half of me said, "Real rap"
But lookin' at the size of him, he's only half of a real man
And if an apple a day keeps the doctor away then how the fuck are you an Ill Mac?
Oi, but nothin' ain't sum him up more than his name does
His names "Illmac" cause he puts on everything that he makes up
So all of a sudden he's Benz, Beamers, Beretta squeezin'
Tryin' to find yourself like Dexter in the second season
Oi, you see I love it when we beat him I'm Kevin Keegan
So I'ma put money down like Deborah Meaden
Oi, they say revenge is sweetest when you're gettin' even
So in that cause I'ma make it a family affair this evening
I run in your house, get your mum and your spouse and beat them slags until they're barely breathin'
And if your uncle's about or your brother's around they both gettin' slung to the mouth for any reason
See I got his nan in the corner, lookin' like she's tryin' to pledge alliegence
Cause I just gave 'Mac's Daddy that Chris Kelly treatment

Dawg, when they called me "legend" I battle anybody with potential that can spit
I put on Manaz and Ness Lee back when Bender wasn't shit
I was the first to call my own time, something that everyone has bit
Shit, I lost to Hollow before Conceited was anything special, he'd admit
I chose Tony D outta everyone on the list and other veterans were skit
And I played a pivotal role in him being as successful as he is
See what I'm settin' is a trend and what I'm gettin' at is this
You brought up my loses but my loses are more influential than your win
See, back '07, if y'all would've made it to the finals, you would've won it, we know
It's just a ring though
Somethin' about how the judges cheated and it wasn't equal
Yo, he's livin' in the past, so it's funny people
My Napoleon Complex ain't got shit on your fuckin' ego Uncle Rico
He's a cocky motherfucker, he always got his nose high
He's a nosy motherfucker, everybody knows why
I came to this battle with no sweat
You came to this battle with nose sweat
Now watch him take a nose dive or him any everyone he knows dies
That thing is plus size and needs work
Shit if he turned just right then his features suggests he shares a bloodline with some kind of extinct bird
I recommend plastic surgery
Cause that thing must make it a massive burden to balance perfectly when you're standing vertically
Dawg, if you don't show some humility, I'll take your soul and your dignity
Aye homie, control your dependency
With that shaped nose it's growth and its symmetry
You take coke and dispose of it instantly
I'm talkin' keys to the face like Beethoven composing a symphony
With them swollen nostrils you sniff bowling balls through
I bet at home they call you, "Nose-feratu"
I was in a hostel when I thought of this, if it bothers you it's fine
Just keep tellin' yourself that all of us put on our clothes one nostril at a time
You know what? Fuck it, cheers, chug a beer
Forget about your long nose and ugly beard
Matter of fact, I'm a John Doe
No, I'm a Ron Gold this chump's career
(Spit it darker!)
This is as dark as I can spit it!
Think you got jokes watch the long nose chuck a spear
Cross bow send him to the crossroads another lost soul among his peers
Watch close, when he raps Eurgh's palm goes up his rear
That's why I brought the long nose up in here like Gonzo's puppeteer
Yeah, shout it on the innercom
I'm in London, but I ain't come to visit long
I just came to snatch my piece of the American Pie and then I'm gone
But fuck it, just before I leave I'ma have to get it on with Stiffler's mom
Time!1Embed
