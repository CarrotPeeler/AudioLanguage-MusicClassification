2 ContributorsTravelinâ€™ Blues LyricsI had a dream last night
I thought my good gal had gone
Well, I woke up this mornin'
She really hadn't done me wrong
I know it's not fair
But my good gal has done 
I'm goin' away, leavin' today
I'm gonna bring my baby back
If that eight wheel driver
Don't jump the railroad track
I take her from that man
Gonna bring her home if I can
My gal's been triflin' 'round
About a week I know
Several of my friends
Just told me so and so
She's findin' new men
And now I can't understand
So I'm goin' away, leavin' today
I'm gonna bring my baby back
If that eight wheel driver
Don't jump the railroad track
I take her from that man
Gonna bring her home if I can

I know it won't be long
We'll both be on that train
My baby's comin' home again
She's been triflin' 'round
But now she has turned him down
Yeah, I'm goin' away, leavin' today
I'm gonna bring my baby back
If that eight wheel driver
Don't jump the railroad track
I take her from that man
Gonna bring her home if I canEmbed
