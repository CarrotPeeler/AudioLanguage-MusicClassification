3 ContributorsA Few Good Men LyricsIt's time we stood up for ourselves so get up off your knees
We'll shake off our detractors and attain our hopes and dreams
And if we fall prey to in-fighting, we're never gonna win
So put aside your differences, sing loud, sing proud
We won't listen to their stories or be waylaid by their lies
It's a dream that's still attainable for kids like you and I
So if we all stand together singing one defiant song
Our voice will reach the heavens, so sing with all your heart

Join us in a song
We shall rise and sing
Stand up and be counted
Sing a song for liberty
Join us in this song
Together we shall sing
Rise up and be counted
Sing it loud, sing it proud
We've been brutalized and crucified, the brunt of their attacks
Is corruption not their trademark and compassion what they lack?
If we can realize our common goals, the end of which is plain
Nited and now stronger, their loss is now our gain!
