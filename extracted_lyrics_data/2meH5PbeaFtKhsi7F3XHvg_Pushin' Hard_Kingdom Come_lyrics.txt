2 ContributorsPushinâ€™ Hard LyricsI wish we'd end this suffering
And all this crazy ranting
Instead of weapon-waving
There would be lives we're saving
Hard, pushin' hard
Pushin' hard, oh
My fear is for the children
And for the lives they're building
I wish I knew the answer
We could avoid disaster
Hard, pushin' hard
Pushin' hard, pushin' hard
So let the sun stream on down from the sky
And let the m-m-moments slip on slowly by
Instead of p-pushin', p-pushin' hard
We wouldn't feel so lonely inside, lonely inside, lonely inside
I wish we'd end this suffering
And all this crazy ranting
I wish I knew the answer
We could avoid disaster
