I want the love that you deny me
That I need so desperately
The tenderness that you posses
You've deprived me

You must pray for the lonely nights
That I walked the floor for you
And don't know you must erase
All the tearstains on my face

Surrender your love, baby
Surrender your love
Surrender your love, baby
Surrender your love

Don't you know that I'm taking my case
To the highest court of love
And these are some of the charges
You'll be found guilty of

You've used me and abused me
'Til I felt like I wanted to die
You created a need in me
That only you can satisfy
You might also like
Surrender your love, baby
Surrender your love
(Surrender your love) Come along peacefully, baby
Surrender your love

(Give it to me) Ow! Right now
(Give it to me, give it to me) Give it to me, oh
(Give it to me) Oh, right now
(Give it to me, give it to me) Give it to me
(Give it to me) Oh, baby

Surrender your love, baby
Surrender your love
Surrender your love, baby
Surrender your love
Surrender your love, baby (Give it to me, ooh)
Surrender your love (Give it to me, oh)
Surrender your love, baby (I want it all, give it to me)
Surrender your love (Hey! Your love)
Surrender your love, baby
Surrender your love (Ow!)1Embed
