2 ContributorsOn the Road Again LyricsWell I'm so tired of cryin'
I'm out on the road again
I'm out on the road again
Well I'm so tired of cryin'
I'm out on the road again
I'm out on the road again
You know the first time I travelled
Out in the rain and snow
In the rain and snow
I didn't have no fare, oh, not even no
Place to go
(I'm on the road again)
And my dear mother left me
When I was quite young
When I was quite young
She said: "Lord have mercy on my
Wicked son"
Take a hint from me, mama, please
Don't you cry no more
Don't you cry no more

Road I'm goin'
Well I ain't goin' down
That long old lonesome road
All by myself
Well I ain't goin' down
That long old lonesome road
All by myself
I can't carry you baby gonna carry
Somebody else
Take a hint from me, mama, please
Don't you cry no more
Don't you cry no more. (x2)
'Cause it's soon one mornin' down the
Road I'm goin'
Well I ain't goin' down
That long old lonesome road
All by myself
Well I ain't goin' down
That long old lonesome road
All by myself
I can't carry you baby gonna carry
Somebody else
Well I'm so tired of cryin'
I'm out on the road again
I'm out on the road again
Again, again, again, again...1Embed
