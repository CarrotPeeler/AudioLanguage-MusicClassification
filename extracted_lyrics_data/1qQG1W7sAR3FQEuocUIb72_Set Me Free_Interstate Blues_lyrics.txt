1 ContributorNeon Motel Room Lyrics
I got a neon motel room just for you
And you can bring whoever you want to
There's nothing in particular we gotta do
And the sign flashes in between red and blue

Just keep on driving down interstate three
Right on past the blockade they set up for me
I could use some lemonade and some company
I've only got about twenty-seven hours to be free

The sign keeps on flashin'
With the fireflies in the air
I'm not even guilty
But the Highway police, they don't care

When you get here just knock on door number two
I've nice little quaint highway view
And you know I'll always take good care of you
And the sign flashes in between red and blue

The sign keeps on flashin'
With the fireflies in the air
I'm not even guilty
But the Highway police they don't careYou might also likeEmbed
