6 ContributorsHome Is Where the Hatred Is Lyrics
A junkie walking through the twilight
I'm on my way home
I left three days ago
But no one seems to know I'm gone
Home is where the hatred is
Home is filled with pain
And it might not be such a bad idea if I never
Never went home again

Stand as far away from me as you can and ask me why
Hang on to your rosary beads
Close your eyes and watch me die
You keep sayin, "Kick it, quit it"
Lord, but did you ever try
To turn your sick soul inside out
So that the world, so that the world can watch you die?

Home is where I live inside white powder dreams
Home was once an empty vacuum that's filled now with my silent screams
Home is where the needle marks
Try to heal my broken heart
It might not be such a bad idea if I never
Never went home again
You might also like
Stand as far away from me as you can and ask me why
Hang on to your rosary beads
Close your eyes and watch me die
You keep sayin, "Kick it, quit it"
Lord, but did you ever try
To turn your sick soul inside out
So that the world, so that the world can watch you die?

Can watch you die
Watch you die
Watch you die
You say, "Kick it"
You keep sayin', "Quit it"
Did you ever try?
Ooh-ooh
Turn your sick soul inside out
So the world can watch you dieEmbed
