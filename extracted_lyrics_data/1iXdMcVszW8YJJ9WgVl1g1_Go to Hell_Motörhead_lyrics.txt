6 ContributorsGo to Hell Lyrics
You told me that you wanted it
I knew it wasn't true
Turned out to be the truth babe
You know what you can do

You can go to hell
You can go to hell
Goodbye for you

Wrapped around your little finger
Under your thumb too
You know that I'm a singer
I'm singing just for you

You can go to hell
You can go to hell
So much for you
Goodbye


I hope you get my little message
I hope you hear me
I thought you might've been the answer
Obviously crazy
You might also like
You can go to hell
You can go to hell
But you're a fair screw

I guess I better get moving
Lot of things I've gotta do
I realize it was a waste of time
Talking sense to you

You can go to hell
You can go to hell
You can go to hell
You can go to hell
