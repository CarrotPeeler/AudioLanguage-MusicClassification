3 ContributorsSo Alone LyricsWell I'll just tell you what you wanna hear
I won't break your girlish fear
I tried to get close, couldn't get near
If I tell you too much, baby, I'll get smear
Said red light, green light
You never stop
Always trying, wore me out
Now I know what you're bopping about
Well I'll just tell you what you wanna hear
If I tell you too much, baby, I'll get smear
Seems like every time I try to love somebody
It's that same old story
I try so hard, i give it everything I got
But in the end I'm the one who's left out
I'm so all aloneYou might also likeEmbed
