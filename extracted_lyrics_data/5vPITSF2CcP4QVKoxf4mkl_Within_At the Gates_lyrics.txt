Magic, the portal; language, the key
As my journey within begins
Once again the gates stand open before me
Time has come for me to climb the tree of life
And sail the seas I know so well
I know so well
I search the winding mazes of my mind
And travel through thoughts left behind
As the waves they carry my ship into the air
A way out, but not back, I must find
I can't go on living in this dead world
Crawling through this life I hate
I won't be thrown to the wolves again
I escape through magic, as darkness it falls, falls
But now the danger lurks within
Through my mind and beyond
My task is insane
And I don't know how my body will respond
But my ship is a strong one
It has carried me through storms worse than this
You might also likeI can't go on living in this dead world
Crawling through this life I hate
I hear music and it guides me
On my quest to infinity
A harbor appears within the mist
It's lighthouse, a sunrise
For a soul starved of light
I try to focus my mind on it
But something is blocking the way
But one day, this city I'll reach
This city I'll reach
I now return to balance again
As mind and body unites
And I close the temples of my mind
Lutis Nitra
Find the powers within
Upon the seas of starvationEmbed
