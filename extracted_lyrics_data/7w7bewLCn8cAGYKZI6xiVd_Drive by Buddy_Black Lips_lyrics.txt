5 ContributorsDrive By Buddy LyricsWell brother what's the matter
Do you hate the life you choose
Well I hope it doesn't flatter
When you're bathing with a hose
But as long as your butt's clean then it's all good
We're hanging on a broken T-bird hood
Well sister what's the matter
Do you hate the life you choose
Well the pathway to your heart
Well it's straight up through your nose
But as long as you're just clean then it's all good
We're hanging on a broken T-bird hood

Well drive, drive buddy
Drive, drive away
Bye, bye buddy
Sorry, but you can't stay
You can't stay
Well you come into my mind
In a transcendental blitz
You're walking down the line
Throwing psychedelic fits
But as long as your just clean then it's all good
We're hanging on a broken T-bird hood
You might also likeYou're coming down the line (yeah)
You're bleeding down the bayou (yeah)
But as long as your butt's clean then it's all good
We're hanging on a broken T-bird hood
