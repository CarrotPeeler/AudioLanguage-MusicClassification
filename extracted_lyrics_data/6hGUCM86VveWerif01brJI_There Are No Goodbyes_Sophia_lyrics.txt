2 ContributorsThere Are No Goodbyes LyricsI lost my head in a landslide
I should have seen it coming
But you took me surprise
Well fold me up gently
And tuck me away into your silence
Where I will sleep
Safe in the secrets that bind us
Because...
There are no goodbyes
There are no goodbyes
And sweetheart
You know that I don't blame you
How can I when I know the pain you hide?
And I'm sorry
Can you forgive me?
I wish that I was stronger but I tried
And even though
I know I should really be letting go
Somehow
Yeah somehow
I just keep holding onâ€¦
