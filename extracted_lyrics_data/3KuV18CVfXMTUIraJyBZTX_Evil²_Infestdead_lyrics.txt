1 ContributorEvilÂ² LyricsThe second coming of the holy draws hear
And christiansanity goes beyond fear
The mass hypocrisy of the hypocrisy
What's in store of this new divine delivery
Await the hour of the ultimate sin
Let the enslavement begin
The grace of god is forever destroyed
Garden of eden explodes in the void extreme malice, injected race
New breed human, raised up in cages
Army of hatred, demons of flesh
As hell is earth, there is no death
Now comes the quest for the key of it all
Mathematics of the most evil call
No sleep until god is dead
No future until all blood is bled
Await the hour of ultimate sin
Let the enslavement begin
The grace of god is forever destroyed
Garden of eden explodes in the void
No sleep until god is dead
No sleep until god is dead
The second coming of the holy draws near
And christiansanity goes beyond fear
The mass hypocrisy of the hypocrisy
What's in store of this new divine delivery
You might also likeAwait the hour of the ultimate sin
Let the enslavement begin
The grace of god is forever destroyed
Garden of eden explodes in the void extreme malice, injected race
New breed human, raised up in cages
Army of hatred, demons of flesh
As hell is earth, there is no death
There is no deathEmbed
