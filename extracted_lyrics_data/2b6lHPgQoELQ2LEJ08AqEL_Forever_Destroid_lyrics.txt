1 ContributorForever LyricsI see the day and I want it all to change
I see your face and I want it to stay the same
I see their ways and I want them all to change
But God, please help me with my final hours
I see your dress and I want it all to wait
I see the sand move by arms and my feet
I see the day and I want it to stay away
I see the holes in my arms and my brain
Blood keeps pouring
Forever flowing
Blood keeps pouring
The pain kept me warm
I set me free
Always flowing
Forever changing
Forever flowing
Forever I am changingYou might also likeEmbed
