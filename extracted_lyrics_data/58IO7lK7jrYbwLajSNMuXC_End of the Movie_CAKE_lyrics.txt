7 ContributorsEnd of the Movie Lyrics
People you love will turn their backs on you
You'll lose your hair, your teeth
Your knife will fall out of its sheath

But you still don't like to leave before the end of the movie

People you hate will get their hooks into you
They'll pull you down, you'll frown
They'll tar you and drag you through town

But you still don't like to leave before the end of the movie
No you still don't like to leave before the end of the show


People you hate will get their hooks into you
They'll pull you down, you'll frown
They'll tar you and drag you through town

But you still don't like to leave before the end of the movie
No you still don't like to leave before the end of the showYou might also like1Embed
