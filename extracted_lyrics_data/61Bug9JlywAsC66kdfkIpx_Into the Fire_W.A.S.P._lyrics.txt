3 ContributorsInto the Fire LyricsGive it to me slow, give now to me
Scream in my ear giving life to me
Come feel confusion, it's illusion, it ain't real
Your love, your lust, could never feel the fear in my eyes
Oh I come to steal, give it all to you, give it all to me
Give into the fire, don't blame it on me
Your devil's your desire now, no, ain't no shame on me
Give into the fire, get down on your knees
And feed your desire, don't tell it, don't tell it to me
Your lust I can feel, don't cry my name
I don't wanna hear it, your passion your pain
My name is fate and I don't claim to be real
I take it all from you, give it all to me
Give into the fire, don't blame it on me
Your devil's your desire now, no, ain't no shame on me
Give into the fire, get down on your knees
I don't want you to love me, no, just give it all, give it all to me
Lay down in the fire, you gave it to me
Reach down in desire for my shame, ain't nothing to me
Advance unto a liar, never gonna see
Advance into a lie and try and see me for what you thought I'd be
My soul is my loss, tell me what you will
Say it, say if it's all you'll need, say if that's your belief
Can you tell me that you don't need, say that you don't bleed
You're burning up, up, up, save your up, up, up
Take me up, up, up, celebrate me
You need to take me, you need to thank me
