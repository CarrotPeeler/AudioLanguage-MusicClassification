1 ContributorIf You Try Lyrics
If you quarrel with your sweetheart
And you don’t know what to do
Don’t break up, you can make up
You can make up if you try

If your dreams seem to shatter
And fade out of view
Don’t break up, you can make up
You can make up if you try, if you try

When the dawn comes around
And the stars are through
You’ll find you still love him
And he still loves you

So remember, now and always
When things go wrong
Don’t break up, you can make up
You can make up if you try, if you try
Woo oo oo
Woo oo oo
Woo oo
