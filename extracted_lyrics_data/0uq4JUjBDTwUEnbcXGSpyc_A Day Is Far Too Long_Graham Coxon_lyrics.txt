7 ContributorsA Day Is Far Too Long LyricsOn sticks and sand lost my money, lost my hands
Blood on my brain, too much salt in my veins
And I thought pain was clean, and I thought hearts were strong
But bones aren't sticks anymore and a day is far too long
So many days never needing any grace
Live for kicks and danger, there'd be beauty any way
And I thought pain was clean, and I thought hearts were strong
But bones aren't sticks anymore and a day is far too long
And a day is far too long, and a day is far too longYou might also likeEmbed
