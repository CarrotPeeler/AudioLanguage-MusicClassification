3 ContributorsWhen the Screams Come Lyrics
The time that you take to find out life
Is not usually worth itself
Developin' a real "know how to get by"
And polishing all it's wealths
Have you ever felt pain?
When the screams come
You know that you're dying in vain

Right

Don't say I didn't warn ya
You had it coming anyway
Now it's just a revelation
You pushed me too far
And now you have got to pay


Why don't we look at all the fools?
Witness their greedy drools
You've entered Hell, I guess you weren't so cool
Now Satan makes your rulesSee Pentagram LiveGet tickets as low as $97You might also likeEmbed
