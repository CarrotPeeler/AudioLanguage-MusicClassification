2 ContributorsTownship Rebellion (Demo) LyricsRebel, rebel and yell
'Cause our people still dwell in hell
Locked in a cell, yes, the structure's a cell
Mad is the story I tell
How long can we wait?
Come on, seein' what's at stake
Action for reaction
If your mind's in a somewhat complacent state, get a check up
This is a stick up
Our freedom, or your life
Lord, I wish I could be peaceful
But there can be no sequel
Now freedom must be fundamental
In Johannesburg, or South Central
On the mic 'cause someone should tell 'em
To kick in the township rebellion
Come on, ugh!
Yeah, what about that, sucka'?
Check it out
Yeah, so you thought you could get with the hardlines
That fill your mind
Thoughts, battles fought, and lessons taught
Yeah, I'll display the fitness, then flip like a gymnast
Cause rhyme after rhyme
And droppin' line after line
Your locked in a test of the mind
Your style is lagging behind, stuck in '89
Yes I'm inclined, I'm wearing a blind
Come to get some in '91
No freedom in the land of the free
If ya see it then tell me
Now freedom must be fundamental
In Johannesburg or South Central
On the mic, 'cause someone should tell 'em
To kick in the township rebellion
