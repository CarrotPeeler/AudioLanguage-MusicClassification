Georgia, Georgia
The whole day through
Just an old sweet song
Keeps Georgia on my mind

Georgia, Georgia
A song of you
Comes as sweet and clear as
Moonlight through the pines

Other arms reach out to me
Other eyes smile tenderly
Still in peaceful dreams I see
The road leads back to you

Georgia, Georgia
No peace I find
Just an old sweet song
Keeps Georgia on my mind

You might also like
Other arms reach out to me
Other eyes smile tenderly
Still in peaceful dreams I see
The road leads back to you

Georgia, Georgia
No peace I find
Just an old sweet song
Keeps Georgia on my mindEmbed
