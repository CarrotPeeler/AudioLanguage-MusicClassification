11 ContributorsMidas Touch Lyrics
The Mi—, the Mi—, the Midas Touch, touch, touch, touch
Touch, touch; touch, touch
Touch, touch; touch, touch

You say you're going through changes
Every day it seems your life is up and down
And you say that you're looking for an answer
Everywhere you look it seems it can't be found
Like searching, trying to find the rainbow
No one's ever found the treasures told to be
But if you're looking for a lover
Everything you need you can find right here with me

I've got the Midas Touch
Everything I touch turns to gold, oh sugar
I've got the Midas Touch
Baby, let me touch your body and your soul

Now you've been trapped by love
Someone takes your heart and then says goodbye
So you say that you'll never love another
Tired of playing games and that's the reason why
But now whenever we're together
There's a certain feeling that we both agree
That it's time that you opened up to love
'Cause if you don't ever try, then baby, you may never see
You might also like
I've got the Midas Touch
Everything I touch turns to gold, yeah, darlin'
I've got the Midas Touch
Baby, let me touch your body and your soul
Oh-oh-ho

Together you and I were meant to be
I'll be right beside whenever you need me
This love we have will never fade away
You can count on me 'cause I'm here to stay

I've got the Midas Touch
Everything I touch turns to gold, yeah, darlin'
I've got the Midas Touch
Baby, let me touch your body and your soul
(Won't you do that for me?)
I've got the Midas Touch
Everything I touch turns to gold (Turns to gold), oh sugar
I've got the Midas Touch
Baby, let me touch your body and your soul
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

Touch, touch; touch, touch; touch, touch
The Midas Touch
Touch, touch; touch, touch; touch, touch
Touch, touch; touch, touch; touch, touch
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-ho
Together you and I were meant to be
I'll be right beside whenever you need me
This love we have will never fade away
You can count on me 'cause I'm here to stay

I've got the Midas Touch
Everything I touch turns to gold
(It's all in my hands)
I've got the Midas Touch
Baby, let me touch your body and your soul
(Won't you let me touch you, baby)
I've got the Midas Touch
Everything I touch turns to gold (Turns to gold), yeah, baby
(Yeah, baby)
I've got the Midas Touch
Baby, let me touch your body and your soul
(Everything I touch)
I've got the Midas Touch
Everything I touch turns to gold (Turns to gold), yeah, darlin'
(Yeah, darlin')
I've got the Midas Touch
Baby, let me touch your body and your soul
(Won't you let me touch you, baby)
