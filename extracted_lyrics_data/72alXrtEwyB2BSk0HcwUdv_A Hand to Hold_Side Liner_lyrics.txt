3 ContributorsIt’ll Be Alright Lyrics
I stayed still while the world kept turning
And I laid there while the house was burning
Couldn't give up on the ghosts I was holding
Surrounded by faces but feeling so lonely

I got my hopes up one too many times
And now my whole life, wanna hit rewind
And do it over, get it right this time
Wish someone told me it’ll be alright

A broken cage with a heartbeat
Going through the motions doesn't make you alive
And I sunk too deep in the pain I was feeling
Don't wanna get better, don’t wanna survive

I got my hopes up one too many times
And now my whole life, wanna hit rewind
And do it over, get it right this time
Wish someone told me it'll be alright

Waited my whole life for a shoulder to cry on
Needed one friend to stay by my side
I found a hand to hold, gave me a reason to try
Had no direction, now together we're falling in line
You might also like
I got my hopes up, now I'm daydreaming
I need someone that'll help me stop scheming and
I'm hoping one day don't gotta keep dreaming
But you, you were by my side, every day I was pleading
I need to know where to go from here 'cause I’m scared inside
I don’t wanna die, but damn I'm hurt inside
Please show me now
Please show me now
Please show me now

I got my hopes up one too many times
And now my whole life, wanna hit rewind
And do it over, get it right this time
Wish someone told me it’ll be alright
I got my hopes up one too many times
And now my whole life, wanna hit rewind
And do it over, get it right this time
Wish someone told me it'll be alrightEmbed
