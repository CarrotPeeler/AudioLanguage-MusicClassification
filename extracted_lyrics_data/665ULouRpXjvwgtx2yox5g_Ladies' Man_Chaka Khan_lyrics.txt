2 ContributorsLadiesâ€™ Man LyricsWell, I've known some heartbreakers, but you take the cake
Ladies' man, ladies' man
You could charm both rattlers off a rattlesnake, yes, you could
Ladies' man, ladies' man
Ladies bring it on over when you give 'em a glance
They don't stand a chance
First, you unfold them
Then you pigeon-hole them, ladies' man
Ladies' man, ladies' man
Ladies' man, ladies' man
Well, it sure takes a lot of good-natured self control
Ladies' man, ladies' man
When I'm so hot for you and you're so cold, so cold, so cold
Ladies' man, ladies' man
Why do you keep on trying to make a man of me? (Make a man of me)
Couldn't you just love me like you love cocaine?
Cocaine and base
Cross my heart, I swear I'm not trying to trick you
No tricks, no tricks
Ladies' man, ladies' man
It's just a straight-ahead feeling I have for you
Nothing slick
Ladies' man, ladies' man

You're acting like a vandal
Wrecking the dream at the first bad scene
Ladies' man, ladies' man
Ladies' man, ladies' man
I know you, yes, I do
Ladies' man, ladies' man
Look out
I know you're just another ladies' man
Sweet talkin', look out
Jive walkin', ladies
Your time is coming, 'cause you're
I know you're just another ladies' man
Ain't got no scruples
Crooked, devious
No good, no good, no, no, no
I know you, I know
I know you're just another ladies' man
All he wants is your money
All he wants is your soul
Keep holding on
Hold on, girl
I know you're just another ladies' man
See, I'm feelin', I'm feelin'
Oh
Oh, no, no
I know you're just another ladies' manEmbed
