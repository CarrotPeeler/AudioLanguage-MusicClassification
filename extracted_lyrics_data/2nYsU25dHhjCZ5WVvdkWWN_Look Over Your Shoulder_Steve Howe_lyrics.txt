2 ContributorsLook Over Your Shoulder LyricsDon't ask me how I know
Just look over your shoulder
You won't recognise yourself
You won't have to ask
Is everyone here much older
Are communications feeling much colder
Everytime you look over your shoulder
Sudden like the wind transversed
The gulf of friendship passed
Stillness mounts in this high place
Silence stays the same
I am I will I can are aims
But can we tell which are the games
Everytime we pass the blame
Fearful thoughts are bitter sweet
His charms are soft in youth
The sting is of elusive hands
That reared him from his tooth
We know that shadows move on course
We'll have to take this boy by force
Everytime you look over your shoulderYou might also likeEmbed
