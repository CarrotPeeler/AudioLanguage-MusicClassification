1 ContributorFirefighter LyricsSo many days you walked into the fire
Ashes and smoke, you knew that it was real
Someone to save, your only desire
Fears had been blown away
Hero, you gave up your life
So brave, firefighter
Ice in your veins but not your heart
So brave, firefighter
Never afraid to do your part
Lightning and spark ignite the forest
Earth is ablaze, weâ€™re praying for rain
Into the flames, you've got to keep on fighting
Till there's nothing left to save
Hero, you gave up your life
So brave, firefighter
Ice in your veins but not your heart
So brave, firefighter
Never afraid to do your part
So brave, firefighter
Ice in your veins but not your heart
So brave, firefighter
Never afraid to do your part
You might also likeSo brave, firefighter
Ice in your veins but not your heart
So brave, firefighter
Never afraid to do your part
