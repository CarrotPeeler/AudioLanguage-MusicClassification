When the money's gone
Will you be my friend?
Float a small row boat till our ship comes in
When the winter nights chill us to the soul
Will you feed the fire?
Spin the straw to gold
When the money's gone

When the money's gone
Will you get cold feet?
Will you still be there if the ends don't meet?
If we're in the red, just forget the green
Take a bus with me
No more limousines
When the money's gone
Will you still want me?

And oh, what a fine life I give to you
All you ever want (Ever want, ever want, ever want)
Oh, will you still be there?
Will you pull me through when the cash don't come?
Whoa, if you're mine
Will you still love me wherever we fall
When the money's gone?
You might also like
Oh, will you want me, baby?
Oh, will you need me, baby? (Oh, will you need me?)
Oh, will you love me, baby?
When the money's gone
Money, money, money's gone
When the money's gone, babe, babe, babe
When the money's gone, babe, babe, babe

When the money's gone
No more caviar
Will you eat fast food in a beat up car?
Live life modestly, lost in lotto dreams
Will you find your way through it all with me?
Through it all with me (Through it all with me)
Will you still love me?

And oh, what a fine life I give to you
All you ever want (Ever want, ever want, ever want)
Oh, will you still be there?
Will you pull me through when the cash don't come?
Whoa, if you're mine
Will you still love me wherever we fall
When the money's gone?
Oh, will you want me, baby?
Oh, will you need me, baby? (Oh, will you need me?)
Oh, will you love me, baby?
When the money's gone
Money, money, money's gone
When the money's gone, babe, babe, babe
Whjennthe moneys all gone
When the money's gone, babe, babe, babe
When the money's gone, babe, babe, babe

And a mile off the shore
Flies a bird who'll land no more
As the tide pulls the sea
So you always will pull me
Forever more
(Forever, forever, forever, forever, forever, forever, froevever)

And oh, what a fine life I give to you
All you ever want (Ever want, ever want, ever want)
Oh, will you still be there?
Will you pull me through when the cash don't come?
Whoa, if you're mine
Will you still love me wherever we fall
When the money's gone?
Oh, will you want me, baby?
Oh, will you need me, baby? (Oh, will you need me?)
Oh, will you love me, baby?
When the money's gone
When the money's all gone
Oh, will you want me, baby? (It's gone, gone)
Oh, will you need me, baby? (When the money's all gone)
Oh, will you love me, baby? (Gone)
When the money's gone (Gone)
When the money's gone, babe, babe, babe (When the money's all gone)
When the money's gone, babe, babe, babe (It's gone, all gone)
When the money's gone, babe, babe, babe (Gone, gone)
When the money's gone, babe, babe, babe (When the money's all gone)

When it's gone
Ooh, the moneys gone
Ooh, the moneys gone
Ooh, the moneys gone
Mm, the moneys gone
When the money's gone
Ooh, the moneys gone
Mm, the moneys goneEmbed
