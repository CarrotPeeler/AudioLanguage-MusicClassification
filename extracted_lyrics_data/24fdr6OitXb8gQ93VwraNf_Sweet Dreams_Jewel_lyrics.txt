2 ContributorsSweet Dreams Lyrics
The shadows are waltzing
The moonbeams are calling
Like a dream I am falling into
Silver threads lined with dew
Twinkling stars seem to shine just for you

Behind your eyes
Are endless blue skies
You travel places I want to come, too
Each breath that you breathe
Is a brush stroke that leads me to you

So sleep
Fall into night's indigo hue
Believe me, it's true
There's nothing that I would not do
For my dream is sweet dreams for you

It seems far away
But there once was a day
It was gray in a world without you
To this heart like a dove from above
The miracle of your love found me
You might also like
So sleep
Fall into night's indigo hue
Believe me, it's true
There's nothing that I would not do
For my dream is sweet dreams for you

So hush you bye
And don't you cry
Sweetly dream, you little baby

Yes, sleep
Lose yourself in night's indigo hue
Believe me, it's true
There is nothing that I would not do
For my dream is sweet dreams
Yes, my dream is sweet dreams for youEmbed
