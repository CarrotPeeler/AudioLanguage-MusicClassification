7 ContributorsWhen the Sky Comes Looking for You Lyrics
What are you going to do now
Out in the lonely times
How will you ever get through now
Remembering all of your crimes

What will you do
And what will you do, who do you think would attempt a rescue
Dreaming, screaming, knocked right out of your shoes
Who would you blame, who could you sue
If the sky came looking for you

How are you gonna live now
Out in the lonely fields
What do you have to give now
I wonder how do you feel

What will you say
What will you say
What will you say when God turns away
Running, jumping, praying it wasn't true
How would you look, without a clue
When the sky comes looking for you
You might also like

Looks like the same old story
Looks like the same old game
Don't think you're bound for glory
I think you might be insane

What do you think, what do you think
What do you think with your nerves on the brink
Dodging, weaving, trying to find a way through
Gonna be bad whatever you do
When the sky comes looking for you1Embed
