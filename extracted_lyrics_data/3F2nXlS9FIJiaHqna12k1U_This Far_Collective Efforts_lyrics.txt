2 ContributorsThis Far LyricsAnd I'm so glad
What you glad about
It's a beautiful day man (sure is)
Sun shining (hell yeah)
It's all nice all the folks out
Cooling man (just chilling)
Everything's going good
And I'm so glad we made it this far
I know my world won't be the same without y'all
To all my friends how ya'll been
It's been some time now I'm back again
New places to go more people to see
Just living and working on the new LP
If you happen to float by and we ain't home
Hopefully means the CE hit the road
With a vision and a sense of awareness
It's like we spent a lifetime preparing for this
And it's got to be true
All that I do I'm willing to be
And I'm just like you fulfilling my dream
And in the meantime I try to talk some
So I can chalk one
A win for the team
See my destiny instantly cling
Never let them be clipping my wings
I need to spread them things
Meant to be seen and witness what's in between
I'm just being me trust and believe
That in your life you may see
What they say is right just may not be
Look to be yourself and you might learn
That you're gonna need more than some time to burn
Got to find your heart develop a skill
Study the art fill your head up with real facts
And figures and listen to different outlooks
It's really less about pull more about push
Wishing is one thing living it is another
Given an inspiration this is what you will discover
A whole world wide open waiting for you
And no matter what you'll be making it through
Cause you understand the pressure
Know when to draw the line
Come prepared lessons
Never fall behind
It's a sign of the times a new time is coming
I'm gonna keep doing mine in due time abundance
You might also like
And I'm so glad we made it this far
I know my world won't be the same without y'all
Now bloods thicker than the liquor that I'm sipping on
More to living than the rhythm that I'm spitting on
I recollect for a second and us regulars do
Give respect to the rest of my crew
2002 to what it is
We be handling biz
From overseas trying to sell CD's to all my kids
Just a page in the book in my life
And still writing in the game and I'm rolling the dice
But still fighting for the feelings
Dealing with the highs and lows
The 2500's and the 25 shows
But fam grows the fans show love in the process
Palm slaps and daps tend to follow the live sets
And that's the object I'm pushing the project
Priceless without it you tend to be lifeless
I might just cool and remember the rules
Remain true can't forget to let the night shine through
And keep moving ya'll
Keep moving ya'll
So far....
Keep moving ya'll
Wait
Did I forget to give you a little bit
More
You can sit close or get in the thick of it
Young
Intimate would have been in the lyrics
A sentimental spirit wish ya'll were here with me
Then again I'm a loner and need space
Trying to find a moment to create in this rat race
Rush rush move move keep running
Just hush hear the soothing sound of nothing
Wind blowing in my ear
Fear no one let momma nature take me there
Wait right here let me get my things I'll be back
Face full of tracks with paint for days in the pass
Trying to bless in every way while I have an opportunity
To drop it musically I got to do it and be true to me
I got a crew and a community we're soon to see a
New beginning bloom beautifully

And I'm so glad we made it this far
I know my world won't be the same without y'allEmbed
