Lie
Lie

Broken mirror
Seven years of stolen luck
I try to fix you one more time
But I must let it die
The dream that we'd survive
Cut my throat if I tell a lie

Set it free, lost ambition
I... overthought my place in your life
Set it free, superstition
I... gave up on this fairy tale lie

Blind man's wisdom
Cross my heart but it's a lie
I kept us going the last time
You used one of your nine lives...
I gave up all of mine...
Cut my throat if I tell a lie

Set it free, lost ambition
I... overthought my place in your life
Set it free, superstition
I... gave up on this fairy tale lie

In the world that I created
I'm intoxicated
In the world that I created
I'm intoxicated
In the world that I created
I'm intoxicated
In the world that I created
I'm intoxicated
In the world that I created
I'm intoxicated
In the world that I created
I'm intoxicated

Set it free, lost ambition
And now I won't look back
I've turned my back, I'm off the ground
Set it free, superstition
And now the air I breathe is poison-free
I'm freedom-bound
Set it free, lost ambition
I... overthought my place in your life
Set it free, superstition
I... gave up on this fairy tale lie
