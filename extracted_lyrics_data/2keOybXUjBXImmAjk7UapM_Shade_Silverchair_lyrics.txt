If you're hurt
Why don't you tell someone
Don't feel bad
You're not the only one, yeah

Don't go hiding
Hiding, in the shade
Don't go hiding
Hiding, in the shade

If you were abused
I'll find someone to help you
I know you were used
What are you gonna' do?
Yeah

Don't go hiding
Hiding, in the shade
Don't go hiding
Hiding, in the shade
