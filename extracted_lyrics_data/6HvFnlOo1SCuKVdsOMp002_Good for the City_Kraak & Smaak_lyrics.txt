3 ContributorsGood for the City Lyrics
There was a fire in the alley
All the rats had fled the scene
The bottleneck of human traffic and their mobile phones
Could not preserve the memory
All of the photos and the stories
Quickly buckled under weights
The bureaucratic indignation
And its red ticker tape parade

This would be good for the city
Imagine it there looking oh so pretty
This would be good for the city
Imagine it there looking oh so pretty
This would be good for the city
Imagine it there looking oh so pretty
This would be good for the city
Imagine it there looking oh so pretty

I call upon the prosecution
Please identify your case
The star witness from the counsel
Quickly put them in their place
He laid his plans out on the table
As all our promises were sold
To build a temple of consumption
Where stood a temple of the soul
He said
You might also like
This would be good for the city
Imagine it there looking oh so pretty
This would be good for the city
Imagine it there looking oh so pretty
This would be good for the city
Imagine it there looking oh so pretty
This would be good for the city
Imagine it there looking oh so pretty
The city
The city
Imagine it there
Imagine it there
The city
The city
Imagine it there looking oh so pretty
There looking oh so pretty

Oh you could hear the shrieks from miles
As they tore straight through the glass
A ghostly choir resurrected
As they await some bass guitars
Their gig is set upon the carcass
With broken hearts we watched fall
The cornerstone of this fine city
A monument to urban sprawl
This would be good for the city
Imagine it there looking oh so pretty
This would be good for the city
Imagine it there looking oh so pretty
This would be good for the city
Imagine it there looking oh so pretty
This would be good for the city
Imagine it there looking oh so pretty
This would be good for the city
Imagine it there looking oh so pretty
This would be good for the city
Imagine it there looking oh so pretty
This would be good for the city
Imagine it there looking oh so pretty
This would be good for the city
Imagine it there looking oh so prettyEmbed
