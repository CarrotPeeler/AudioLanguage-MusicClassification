Greensboro woman, don't you smile on me
I do not feel like being comforted
And anyway I'll be home soon
For once there's someone waiting there
And if you don't mind, I'll just think on her instead

Your face, she's a picture, babe
But pictures ain't what I crave
I do not feel this way most generally
I just put a thousand miles
Between me and where my thoughts do lie
And I'd thank you kindly, babe, if you kindly let me be

Your car, she's smooth and fast
Babe, your bourbon's fine
But I ain't feeling free and clear today
Texas loving laying on my mind
I couldn't do you right, babe
Spinning around this way

So Greensboro woman, don't you smile on me
I do not feel like being comforted
And anyway I'll be home soon
For once there's someone waiting there
And if you don't mind, I'll just think on her insteadYou might also likeEmbed
