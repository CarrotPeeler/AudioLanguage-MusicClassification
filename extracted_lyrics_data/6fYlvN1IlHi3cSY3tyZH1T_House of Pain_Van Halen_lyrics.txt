5 ContributorsHouse of Pain Lyrics
Say you're gonna leave me 'cause I only tie you up
I always loved you tender, but you only like it rough
Woman bound for glory, why you leavin' me again?
Gonna pack your bags and leave this house of pain

Heartache's all around me, how many times we tried?
Said she tried to leave me, but her hands were always tied
If I had it all to do, I'd keep it just the same
Gonna fix it so you never leave this house of pain


Uh-uh, uh-uh
Uh, uh-uh, uh-uh-uh
Uh-uh, uh-uh
Uh, uh-uh, uh-uh-uh
Uh-uh, uh-uh
Uh, uh-uh, uh-uh-uh-owYou might also likeEmbed
