2 ContributorsWay of the Rotting LyricsSkin peeled from home
As yu're cleansed in hell
Through morbid pain
You pay for your sickened ways
You pay in blood
This is your punishment
Forever alive to die again
Flowing from your veins
The sick inside
Choke on putrefaction
Slowly as you die
As you're killed again and again
Rotting is your soul
Devoured
Morbid is the way you will travel
Damnation through torture
As you slowly burn
Suffering brings the end to your sickened ways
This is your punishment
Forever alive to die again
You might also likeSkin peeled from bone
As you're cleansed in hell
Through morbid pain
You pay for your sickened ways
You pay in bloodEmbed
