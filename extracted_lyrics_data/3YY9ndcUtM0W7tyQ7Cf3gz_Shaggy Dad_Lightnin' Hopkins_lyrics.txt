Shaggy dad, walkin' down
He walk all around
Shaggy dad, where you been?
I been walkin' to see my friend

Knocked on the door, she wouldn't let me in
Asked to re-know, wanna know where I been
Shaggy dad

Last one day, he got lost
Jumped on a alligator, thought it was a horse

Shaggy dad, don't stay out too long
Yes I know that it's wrong

Mmmhmm, mmmhmmhmm
Mmmhmm, mmmhmm
Shaggy dad, long bills
He get to walkin', you know who it is
Walk on, shaggy dad
Got a good reputation, the man is badYou might also likeEmbed
