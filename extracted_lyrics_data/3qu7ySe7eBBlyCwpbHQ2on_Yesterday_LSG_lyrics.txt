2 ContributorsYesterday LyricsMy friend, my friend, my friend
Don't get me wrong
I had to write this song
Cause I don't believe you're feeling me
I want input from you desperately
But it seems you keep turning your head
You say that you love me
You say that you're down
But when times got hard
Couldn't find you around
Why does it have to be this way
We said friends for life through the good and the bad days
True love ain't supposed to be this way
There's a cloud and it's raining on our yesterday, sing
Raining down
Raining down
No I ain't mad (i ain't mad, I ain't mad)
Just a little confused
Is it that morning that keeps you clinging to me
We've had ups we've had downs so we're even to me me
Said I love you (love you)
And the love you've given to me
But it ain't like it was fuss and fighting so much
When i'm trying to find just a little peace of mind
Why does it have to be this way
We said friends for life through the good and the bad days
True love ain't supposed to be this way
There's a cloud and it's raining on our yesterday
Raining down
Raining down
You might also likeYesterday you could do nothing
Yesterday it was just a happy song
Now today it's just a bad melody
And what's worse we're singing in two different keys
Yesterday I knew I could count on you
Yesterday the clouds were gone the skies were blue
Now today is gray with chance of rain
The rain has come and blown away our yesterday
Raining down
Raining down
Why does it have to be this way
We said friends for life through the good and the bad days
True love ain't supposed to be this way
There's a cloud and it's raining on our yesterday
Raining down
Raining down
Raining down
Raining down
Raining down
Raining down.....Embed
