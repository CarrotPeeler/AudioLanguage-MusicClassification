1 ContributorMidnight in Hollywood Lyrics
Fallin' forward, never fakin', this is real life
All or nothin', never runnin' from a real fight
I wear my heart on my sleeve so you can feel me
My life a movie, so I guess that's why they film me

One take before a curtain call
City of broken dreams, I done heard it all
I know the spotlight looks good
When it's midnight in Hollywood
One take before a curtain call
City of broken dreams, I done heard it all
I know the spotlight looks good
When it's midnight in Hollywood

I count my lucky blessings, they counted out a fighter
It's doubles season, I don't еven got a rock designer
I makе a hundred Gs and spend it on some eyeliner
Cry some tears, wear 'em proud, that's just my reminder
Fuck an advance, never again, and they gon' make me dance
New demands, double it up for Bowie and my man
Ey, I just hope they understand me now
Spent a pretty penny on a dream to make my family proud
Outside, in the lights, Hollywood at night
All these stars on the ground, step into my life
I'll be somewhere in the Hills, stayin' outta sight
I know I'm fallin', but I'll be alright
You might also like
Fallin' forward, never fakin', this is real life
All or nothin', never runnin' from a real fight
I wear my heart on my sleeve so you can feel me
My life a movie, so I guess that's why they film me

One take before a curtain call
City of broken dreams, I done heard it all
I know the spotlight looks good
When it's midnight in Hollywood
One take before a curtain call
City of broken dreams, I done heard it all
I know the spotlight looks good
When it's midnight in Hollywood

They wouldn't doubt me, I'm not slippin', baby, not at all (Not at all)
Came from the bottom, now I'm ballin' till my curtain call (Till curtain call)
I'ma slip in with a vixen
I try to give 'em all the answers, they don't listen
Sunlight turns to moonlight (Moonlight)
I try to fit in with the crowd, but it don't feel right (Don't feel right)
My sis Chanel says we blessed to live a good life (A good life)
I said, "you're right," and blew the budget all in one night
Fallin' forward, never fakin', this is real life
All or nothin', never runnin' from a real fight
I wear my heart on my sleeve so you can feel me
My life a movie, so I guess that's why they film me

One take before a curtain call
City of broken dreams, I done heard it all
I know the spotlight looks good
When it's midnight in Hollywood
One take before a curtain call
City of broken dreams, I done heard it all
I know the spotlight looks good
When it's midnight in HollywoodEmbed
