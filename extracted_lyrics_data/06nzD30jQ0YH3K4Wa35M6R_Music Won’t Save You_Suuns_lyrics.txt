5 ContributorsMusic Won’t Save You LyricsI saw you there with a light in your eyes
Yeah you were singing about, something
I hear you, man, see you look that way
The music won't save you
And now I'm talking to the old god
About rock and roll
But the old god don't listen
To rock and roll no more
Yeah music won't save you
Smoke is in your eyes
Now somethin’ ain’t right here
The music won't save you
Look away, away from the light
I'm tryin', tryin', try as I might
I hear you, man, sing the same old song
Your music won't save youYou might also likeEmbed
