3 ContributorsLittlestep LyricsMy head’s facing forward
I’m sat still in my chair
It was early November
It was a very cold year
My vehicle is frozen
Like a once smiled with fear
13 years by the water
And I’m clean of all sin
I just go through the motions
Before we were lovers
No one has spoken to me
With the others
I just go through the motions
Until you come by me
I say…

And I feel it, falling like ice
Tie down my fears and get out of my sight
And I see it, we’re falling in fire
Tie down my fears and get out my sight
Now it is certain, she earned my world
Bury my wound, time here is up
You might also likeI don’t know any more
You’re the only one I done wrong

And I feel it, falling like ice
Tie down my fears and get out of my sight
And I see it, we’re falling in fire
Tie down my fears and get out my sight
Now it is certain, she earned my world
Bury my wound, time here is up
