1 ContributorWrap It Up LyricsSometimes they call me the dealer
And me, I deals in ideals
You may consult me if you have the fear
I'm just as fazed as any other
I have some wings but I have no feather
I flew east to find myself a guru
I won't decide if tomorrow'll do
Take your coat and wrap it round you
Protection from what surrounds you
For every fact there's a little maybe
And I'm still confused as a baby
Sometimes they'll ask me some questions
And me, I give them suggestions
There will be no fee for the consultation
I'm just as fazed as any other
I've got some wings but I have no feather
I flew east to find myself a guru
I won't decide if tomorrow'll do
Take your coat and wrap it round you
Protection from what surrounds you
For every fact there's a little maybe
And I'm still confused as a baby
I'm still confused as a baby
You might also likeTell me what you want I'll wrap it up for you
Tell me what you need I'll wrap it up for you
I'm just as fazed as any other
I've got some wings but I have no feather
I flew east to find myself a guru
I won't decide if tomorrow'll do
Take your coat and wrap it round you
Protection from what surrounds you
For every fact there's a little maybe
And I'm still confused as a baby
I'm still confused as a baby
I'm still confused as a baby
I'm still confused as a babyEmbed
