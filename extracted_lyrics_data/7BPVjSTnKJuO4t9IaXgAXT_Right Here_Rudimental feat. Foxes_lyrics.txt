11 ContributorsRight Here Lyrics
Late at night, when you realize you're on your own
I know the feelings inside you, they start to grow
[Pre-Chorus: Foxes}
Please tell me that it's alright, alright (alright...)
I wanna know
Please tell me that it's alright, alright (alright...)
I wanna know
Please tell me (tell me)

'Cause everybody's got something
Something they can't hide
Let it out into the open
Right here, right now
'Cause everybody's got something
Something they can't hide
Let it out into the open
Right here, right now

Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh

When you turn the light and you're all alone (-lone...)
Cold as the shapes and the shadow's gone (gone...)
