6 ContributorsSheep May Safely Graze Lyrics
Sheep may safely graze
All the wolves have been rounded up and put to bed
Sheep may safely graze
There are only days of happiness up ahead
Sheep may safely graze, my boy
All the crocodiles have been hunted from your dreams

Sheep may safely graze
Wooly lambs are gamboling by the streams
Sheep may safely graze
All the lost children will be found in time
Sheep may safely graze, my boy
Close your eyes, your daddy is by your side

And if by chance you wake at night
The hollow sorrow that lingers
And you grab at the tails of your dreams
But they scuttle through your fingers
All you can hear outside
Is the roar of a city being raised
It's just the powers that be
Making it safe to graze

Sheep may safely graze
The bluebirds have chased the vultures from the sky
Sheep may safely graze
The day is merely gone now and closed its eyes
Sheep may safely graze, my boy
All the fishes are leaping into the nets

Sheep may safely graze
This, my darling, is as good as it gets
Sheep may safely graze
All the lost children will be found in time
Sheep may safely graze, my boy
Close your eyes, your daddy is by your side

If you shouldn't wake tomorrow
The fences are all torn down
The woods are full of howling beasts
And there ain't nobody around
And everything seems foreign
To your little ways
That's just the gods above
Making it save to graze
The fox has its hole
The bird has its nest
But the son of man has no place
To lay his head and restEmbed
