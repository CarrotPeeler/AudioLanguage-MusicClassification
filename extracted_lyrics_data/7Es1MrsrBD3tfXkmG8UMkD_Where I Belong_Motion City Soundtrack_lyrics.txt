8 ContributorsWhere I Belong LyricsHello there how you doing
I've got all these thoughts just floating through my brain
They bump and they collide and cause a flurry of confusion
And it's getting on my nerves
I try to hold myself together
Fighting off this mental weather when I can (Sometimes I do)
But this shit-storm's never ending
And the atmospheric pressure's calling for rain
This is what I've got going on
This is where I belong tonight
It's chaos in the courthouse
And the left side's all upset
Because the right side wants a summer home
And knows we can't afford it
I try to mediate between this constant tug-o-war machine
But wind up in a never ending game of telephone
There's so much going on
And I just need seven minutes to calm myself back down
Now I forgot where I was
Was it me we were talking about?
This is what I feared from the start
I keep falling apart
You might also likeWhat's going on, is this where I belong tonight?
(What's going on tonight)
What's going on, is this where I belong and I
(What's going on)
(I can't stand)
I can't stand the thought of losing
Sentences and every island of words
(I can't stand)
I can't stand the thought of losing
Everything I ever thought I that I knew
This is where I run out of words
That describe how I'm so damn hurt
This is where I fumble and fold
And take what I'm told
What's going on, is this where I belong and I
(What's going on tonight)
What's going on, is this where I belong and I
(What's going on tonight)
What's going on, is this where I belong and I
(What's going on)
(I can't stand)
I can't stand the thought of losing
Sentences and every island of words
(I can't stand)
I can't stand the thought of losing
Everything I ever thought that I knewEmbed
