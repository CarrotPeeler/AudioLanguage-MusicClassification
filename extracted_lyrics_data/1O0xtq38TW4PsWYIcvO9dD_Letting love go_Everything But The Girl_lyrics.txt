3 ContributorsLetting Love Go Lyrics
Of course I feel betrayed
But that's the way it goes
Everyone knows
Trying to make you love me again
Crying at your door
Just to hold you once more

Darling I know
It's so hard to let a love go
It's not easy letting love go
It's so hard to let a love go

Darling don't I know
It is never easy letting go
When it's gone on and on and on and on
On and on and on and on
Darling don't I know
It is never easy letting go
When it's gone on and on and on and on
On and on and on and on

Your friends said you looked well
You promised that you'd write
And call them at night
But if you wake up in another town
And it's loneliness you've found
Just 'cause I'm not around ('Cause I'm not around)
You might also like
Darling you'll know
It's so hard to let a love go
It's not easy letting love go
It's so hard to let a love go

Darling don't I know
It is never easy letting go
When it's gone on and on and on and on
(It's gone) On and on and on and on
Darling don't I know
It is never easy letting go
When it's gone on and on and on and on
(It's gone) On and on and on and on

But I'm not gonna pretend
I find it hard to forgive
And find a new way to live
And if I had my time again
I'd still have you back
It's as simple as that

Darling I know
It's so hard to let a love go
It's not easy letting love go
It's so hard to let a love go
Darling don't I know (No)
It is never easy letting go
When it's gone on and on and on and on
(It's gone) On and on and on and on (Oh)
Darling don't I know
It is never easy letting go
When it's gone on and on and on and on
(And gone) On and on and on and on

It ain't easy I know
But you gotta let go
It ain't easy I know
But you gotta let go (Oh no)
It ain't easy I know
Letting love goEmbed
