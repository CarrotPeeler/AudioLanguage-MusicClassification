2 Contributors(Love Is Just) The Game LyricsWho sits at home all alone waiting for you to call?
And what is the power that keeps him by the telephone?
And why do you string him along, singing your siren song?
And why does he listen, how can he let this game go on?
I´m just a trivial pursuit
Love is just a game to you
And you never want to let romance begin
'cause I´m gonna make some moves
I´m gonna get the jump on you
I´m not gonna play unless you let me win
I´m just a trivial pursuit
Love is just a game to you
And I´m gonna win no matter what to do
'cause I´m gonna make some moves
I´m gonna get the jump on you
And I´m not gonna be a trivial pursuit
Why does he let this go on
Chances have come and gone
And what is the magic
That keeps him hangin' on so long?
And why do treat him this way
What is this game you play...
You might also likeAnd why does he follow
How long will he go on this way?
I´m in a trivial pursuit
Love is just a game to you
And you never want to let romance begin
'cause I´m gonna make some moves
I´m gonna get the jump on you
I´m not gonna play unless you let me win
I´m in a trivial pursuit
Love is just a game to you
And I´m gonna win no matter what to do
'cause I´m gonna make some moves
I´m gonna get the jump on you
And I´m not gonna be a trivial pursuit
Trivial pursuit, trivial pursuitEmbed
