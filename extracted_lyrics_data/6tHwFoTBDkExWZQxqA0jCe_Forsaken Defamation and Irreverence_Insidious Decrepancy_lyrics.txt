1 ContributorForsaken Defamation and Irreverence LyricsKneeling before the deity
Never has even occurred to me
Questioning his authority
Through merciless acts of hypocrisy
Snowing no mercy upon the priest
Crucify them to obscurity
Satisfy my curiosity
Will your lord hear your ungodly screams?
Blessed forsaken idolatry
Tempting my need to eradicate
Every sheep of ChristianityGenocide seals this unholy fate
Swallow the cross
Choke on your god
Judgement is here
Nowhere to run
Father begot
Languish in sin
Exit eden
Enter your hell
Prophesizing man's damnation
Mindless drones uncreation
Briging forth revelation
Purge thy soul of defamation
Illusion of the weak
Redemption just a dream
Fools drowning in their faith
Ignorant lunatics
Fall to your knees
Divinity deaf to your screams
Calling his name wasting your breath
Embracing death
Immaculate devastation I shall achieve
Rid this foul earth of their disease infecting meYou might also likeEmbed
