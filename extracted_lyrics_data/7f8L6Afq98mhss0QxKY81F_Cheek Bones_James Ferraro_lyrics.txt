4 ContributorsCheek Bones LyricsThese cigarettes cancer
These cigarettes give me cancer
Can't ask since I (Bleaugh!)
Who would die for you
Who would die for you
Die for you
I would do (Bleaugh!)
I don't want to get cancer
But these cigarettes give me cancer
See I love you, I (Bleaugh!)
And I start to cry
Yeah, and I start to cry
Wish you were where you where
Ooh, all you do try (Bleaugh!)
Won't take care of your life
Won't take care of your love
I'll take care of you if you take care of me
I just agree
I start to cry and it hurts and it hurts
And I bleed a lot
A world of your body sleeps
They sleep and I can't sleep (Bleaugh!)
You might also likeAnd I start to cry
As you're crying, as you were, as it hurts
And you live all your life (Bleaugh!)
You hush me with your touch
So (Bleaugh!)
And I start to cry
And I start to cry
