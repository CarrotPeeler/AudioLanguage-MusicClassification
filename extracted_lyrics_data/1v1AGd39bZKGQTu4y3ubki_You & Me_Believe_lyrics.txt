3 ContributorsNo Way Lyrics
You promised not to let me down
You promised that you'd be around
You said I'd never hurt again
Me believe you? There's no way
You promised that you'd hold my hand
You promised that you'd be my man
I need for you to understand
For me to trust you, there's no way

You come and go
You stay, you leave
You're full of empty promises
That never came to be
And baby you say our love was built to last
Not love like this
I need someone to count on
Not just now and then
And baby you said

You promised not to let me down (Oh, you said)
You promised that you'd be around
You said I'd never hurt again (I can't believe you)
Me believe you? There's no way (No way)
You promised that you'd hold my hand (Oh)
You promised that you'd be my man (My baby)
I need for you to understand
For me to trust you, there's no way
You might also like
I'm moving on, oh, that's best for me
You swear to make it better, babe
But I can't believe
'Cause I've heard it all before
It's in the past, must look ahead
I thought that I'd be loving you
But I'm hurt instead
Oh, you

You promised not to let me down (You said)
You promised that you'd be around (Oh, oh, oh, oh)
You said I'd never hurt again
Me believe you? There's no way (No way)
You promised that you'd hold my hand (My baby)
You promised that you'd be my man (Yeah)
I need for you to understand (Please just understand)
For me to trust you, there's no way

(Every) Every tear I've cried
(Every time) Every time you lied
(And all the times you broke)
And every time you broke my heart
(Boy, you broke my heart)
Now I'm going on (My heart)
'Til the pain is gone
I'm waiting for the pain to go away (Away)
You promised not to let me down (You said)
You promised me, that you'd be around (Yeah)
You said I'd never hurt again, never to leave (Oh, can I trust you, baby?)
Me believe you? Baby, no way (You said that you would be my man)
You promised that you'd hold my hand
You promised that you'd be my man, you promised me (Hold my hand)
I need for you to understand (So how can I believe you, baby?)
For me to trust you, there's no way, baby no away
You promised not to let me down (Oh, oh, oh)
You promised that you'd be around, you promised me
You said I'd never hurt again, never to leave me (How can I after all the promises)
Me believe you? Baby, no way (Baby, baby)
You promised that you'd hold my hand ('Cause you promised me)
You promised that you'd be my man, you promised me (That you'd always be)
I need for you to understand. never to leave (Oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh)
For me to trust you, there's no way, baby, no way
You promised not to let me down
You promised that you'd be around (Never, never let me down)
You said I'd never hurt again
Me believe you? There's no way (So how can I, how can I)Embed
