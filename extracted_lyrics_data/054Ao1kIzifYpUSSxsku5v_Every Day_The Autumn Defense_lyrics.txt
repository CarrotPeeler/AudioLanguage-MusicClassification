1 ContributorEvery Day LyricsEvery day is a brand new way
Calling out the games you play
Tell me what is on your mind
A dream that's true or a wish unkind
I wanna see
With new clarity
I wanna know
If it's you and me
Everyone has a heart to share
But no one knows when the light will be there
I can see it in your eyes
This comes as no surprise
Walking through this broken town
Friendly faces nowhere to be found
And no one knows what is coming down
And every day is another round
I wanna see
With a new clarity
I wanna know
Is it you and me?
Every day is a brand new way
Calling out the games we play
Tell me what is on your mind
A dream that's true or a wish unkindYou might also likeEmbed
