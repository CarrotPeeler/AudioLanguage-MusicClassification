8 ContributorsGold Lyrics
I feel it coming on again
The sadness, the tears
I feel it coming on again
My demons, my fears

As my face grows old
My blood runs cold
The years of my youth
Begin to unfold

Turn my friends into gold
You'll never understand
How can I be so cold?
Your heart is in my hand
Turn my friends into gold
You’ll never understand
How can I be so cold?
Your heart is in my hand


I feel it coming on again
The pain, the sorrow
I feel it coming on again
I'll be dead by tomorrow
You might also like
As my face grows old
My blood runs cold
The years of my youth
Begin to unfold

Turn my friends into gold
You'll never understand
How can I be so cold?
Your heart is in my hand
Turn my friends into gold
You’ll never understand
How can I be so cold?
Your heart is in my hand
(Heart is in my hand)Embed
