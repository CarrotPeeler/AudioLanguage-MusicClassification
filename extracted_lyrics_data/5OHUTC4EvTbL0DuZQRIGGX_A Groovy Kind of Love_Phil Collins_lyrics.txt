When I'm feelin' blue, all I have to do
Is take a look at you, then I'm not so blue
When you're close to me, I can feel your heartbeat
I can hear you breathing in my ear

Wouldn't you agree?
Baby, you and me got a groovy kind of love

Anytime you want to, you can turn me onto
Anything you want to, anytime at all
When I kiss your lips, ooh, I start to shiver
Can't control the quivering inside

Wouldn't you agree?
Baby, you and me got a groovy kind of love


When I'm feelin' blue, all I have to do
Is take a look at you, then I'm not so blue
When I'm in your arms, nothin' seems to matter
My whole world could shatter, I don't care
You might also like
Wouldn't you agree?
Baby, you and me got a groovy kind of love

We got a groovy kind of love
We got a groovy kind of love
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
We got a groovy kind of love1Embed
