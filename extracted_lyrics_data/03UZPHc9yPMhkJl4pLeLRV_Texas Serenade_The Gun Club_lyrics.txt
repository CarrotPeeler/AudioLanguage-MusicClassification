3 ContributorsTexas Serenade Lyrics
He's dead on the lawn
Of the house that he owned
What will they say about him?
He had medals
He was in the war
What will they say about him?

He had folks in Houston
But he moved out west
What will they say about him?
The Mexican neighbors
And the women stand crying
Wonder what he was involved in

Always ask me, but I don't know anymore
Always ask me, but I don't care anymore

He was the violent kind
He saved me once or twice
And what should I say about it?
I tried so hard
But I just said, "No"
Now what should I say about him?
About him
You might also like
Always ask me, but I don't know anymore
Always ask me, but I don't care anymore
Always ask me, but I don't know anymore
Always ask me, but I don't care anymore, oh

That he's dead on the lawn
That he's dead on the lawn
What will they say about him?
What will they say about him?
What will they say about him?
Ooh, ooh, woah

Please, oh please, please don't ask me
Please, oh please, oh please don't ask me
Oh please, oh please, oh please don't ask me
Please, oh please, oh please don't ask me
Oh, oh, oh (Ask me)Embed
