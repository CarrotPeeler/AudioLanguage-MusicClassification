2 ContributorsA Bright Cold Day In April LyricsIt was a bright cold day in April the clocks
Were striking on thirteen when she checked the mailbox
She yawned and took her place
Numbered and indexed and neat in the database
Just looked the same as any old letter
In it drop, tear the top, and a card inside
They say that it'll make our lives better
Nothing to fear if you've got none to hide
You'll be data protected, you'll be part of the team
Now that you're a number on the screen
All securely connected to the central machine
Now that you're a number on the screen
Outside, the sky, was shiny and blue
The officer stopped her and scanned all her details through
She smiled because she knew
That he was from England because he had a nice card too
The fingerprint it didn't upset her
For these laws in the wars he fought and died
They say that it'll make our lives better
Nothing to fear if you've got none to hide
You'll be data protected, you'll be part of the team
Now that you're a number on the screen
All securely connected to the central machine
Now that you're a number on the screen
