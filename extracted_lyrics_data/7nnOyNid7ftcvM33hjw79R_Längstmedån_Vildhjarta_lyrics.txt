3 ContributorsLängstmedån LyricsDamned, these vultures
With glistening eyes
Menacingly roving
The dreams and the pain
And your worn out name
Something has gone wrong
And it chafes me
And enslaves me
No matter what
This is not going to change me
I find myself somewhere
Lying naked in the wild-woods (I find myself)
Along an ever-flowing stream
With all of my warm desires
And my cold nostalgic dreams
And when they stay
And when they stay
I'll live through
A thousand deaths
If my head was silent
And if my eyes were closed
The visions of reality wouldn't speak
With such a vile, relentless voice

So the damage is done
What I saw, would not be
But the things I hide is all I see
What I saw, would not be
But the things I hide is all I see1Embed
