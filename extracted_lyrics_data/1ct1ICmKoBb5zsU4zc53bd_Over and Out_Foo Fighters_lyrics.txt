7 ContributorsOver and Out Lyrics
Restless little one
Comfortable and warm
Let me fall apart
Crippled in your arms

Chase me through the dark
Ready on your mark
First to reach the stars
Wins a broken heart, one that broke apart
Shattered from the start

Are you there?
Do you read me?
Are you there?
I don't feel you anymore

Cages and alarms
Keepin' us from harm
I will be the guard
Hope to rest upon

Could I be the one
To break a will so strong?
Pray it won't be long
'Til your will is gone, everythin' is done
Nothin' left at all
You might also like
Are you there?
Do you read me?
Are you there?
I don't feel you anymore
Are you there?
Will you give in
Are you there?
If I give out?

(Ooh-ooh-ooh)
Over and out
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)

Cages and alarms
Keepin' us from harm
I will be the guard
Hope to rest upon, everythin' is done
Nothin' left at all

Are you there?
Do you read me?
Are you there?
I don't feel you anymore
Are you there?
Will you give in
Are you there?
If I give out?1Embed
