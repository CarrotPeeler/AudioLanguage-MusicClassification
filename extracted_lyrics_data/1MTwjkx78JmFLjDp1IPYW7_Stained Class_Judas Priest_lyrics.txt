Wild-eyed and tight-fisted, I'm fused to the bone
I stand contemplating, reacting alone

Impaled with betrayal, the tourniquet turns
Society's creation, pole-axed out and burnt

Long ago when man was king
His heart was clean, now he's stained class
Time has slashed each untouched thing
So now he's just a stained-class king

Transfixed at deliverance, is this all there is?
Faithless continuum, into the abyss
Fierce is my conviction, absolute my belief
I spit at your apathy and seducer deceit

Long ago when man was king
His heart was clean, now he's stained class
Time has slashed each untouched thing
So now he's just a stained-class king
See Judas Priest LiveGet tickets as low as $76You might also like
Lethal, deadly, hung, drawn and quartered
He slaughtered and faltered and altered the world
But by doing so, smashed all his hopes and Utopian dreams
Whipping, stripping, peeling the flesh off
Relentless and senseless, his lust snapped like vipers
Whose fangs sank in deep to infest and decay from the core


Impaled with betrayal, the tourniquet turns
Society's creation, pole-axed out and burnt

Long ago when man was king
His heart was clean, now he's stained class
Time has slashed each untouched thing
So now he's just a stained-class king

Stained-class kingEmbed
