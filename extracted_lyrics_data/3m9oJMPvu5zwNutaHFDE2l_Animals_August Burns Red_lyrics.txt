6 ContributorsAnimals LyricsHow must you feel up there?
So exalted with such a haughty attitude
No one's inferior to your wise words, my dearest friend
Acting as though you have authority to judge
You do not have permission
You do not have permission
Who gave you license to pour hate down throats
Bringing them a shameful disposition?
Disposition
No one likes a discouraging word
Slurring out of a drunkard's mouth
Intoxicated on his own pride
Intoxicated on his own pride
How do you feel, safe and secure? (Safe and secure)
You were wrong
You judge the faith, lives, and actions
Based on your insecurities
Words cut like blades to the skin
Making people numb to the feeling
Words cut like blades to the skin
Why can't you realize what you are doing?
Where is their self worth now? (Now)
Running miles far away, based on your invitation
Cage your mouth, and listen to your heart
We are not animals, nor are you simply worn
We are who we are
From beginning to end
You might also likeDon't judge the loved
Stop hating the hurt
Quit living for such selfish demands
If you don't stop while you're ahead
Pride will lead you to self-destruct
Kingdom come, no one is done
All have been forgiven
We are who we are from beginning to end
Kingdom come, no one is done
All have been forgiven
We are who we are from beginning to endEmbed
