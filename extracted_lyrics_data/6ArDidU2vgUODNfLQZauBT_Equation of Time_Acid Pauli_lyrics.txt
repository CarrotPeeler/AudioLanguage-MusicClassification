3 ContributorsDie Hard Part 2 LyricsELLIS
John, they're giving me a few minutes to try and talk some sense into you. I know you think you're doing your job, and I can appreciate that, but you're just dragging this thing out.
None of us gets out of here until these people can negotiate with the LA police, and they're just not gonna start doing that until you stop messing up the works.
MCCLANE
(carefully)
Ellis, what have you told them?
ELLIS
I told them we're old friends and you were my guest at the party.
McClane sighs, partially relieved.  Hans meanwhile, narrows his
eyes.
MCCLANE
Ellis...you shouldn't be doing this...
ELLIS
Tell me about it.
He looks at Hans, who gives him a nod.
ELLIS
All right...John, listen to me...They want you to tell them where the
detonators are.  They know people are listening.  They want the detonators of they're going to kill me.
Ellis gives Hans a big "ok" sign.  Hans returns it.
236     INT. POLICE TRAILER - ON POWELL, ROBINSON - SAME     236
and others listening intently.  McClane closes his eyes and
leans his head back again.  He knows what is going to happen,
even if this poor bastard Ellis doesn't.
ELLIS' VOICE
John, didn't you hear me?
MCCLANE
(to CB, quietly)
Yeah, I hear you, you fucking moron!
ELLIS
John, I think you could get with the program a little.  The police
are here now.  It's their problem. Tell these guys where the detonators are so no one else gets hurt.  Hey, I'm putting my life on the line for you buddy...
MCCLANE
Don't you think I know that!  Put Hans on!  Hans, listen to me, that
shithead doesn't know what kind of scum you are, but I do --
HANS
Good.  Then you'll give us what we want and save your friend's life.
You're not part of this equation. It's time to realize that.
Saying this, Hans takes out his gun, points it at Ellis, smiling. Ellis smiles, too.
ELLIS
What am I, a method actor?  Hans, babe, put away the gun.  This is
radio, not television...
MCCLANE
That asshole's not my friend! I barely know him!  I hate his
fucking guts -- (desperately sincere)-- Ellis, for Christ's sake, tell
him you don't mean shit to me --
ELLIS
John, how can you say that, after all these years--?  John?  John?
Ellis looks at Hans and shrugs, "Well, I tried..." Hans nods
understandingly.  He takes the CB, presses the TALK button, and
in one frighteningly smooth motion brings the Walther up to
Ellis' forehead and PULLS THE TRIGGER.
CUT TO:
237     INT. 33RD FLOOR - MCCLANE                            237
He was expecting the SHOT but it still chills him.
238     30TH FLOOR - HOLLY AND HOSTAGES                      238
She lowers her head sadly.  Around her, the others go CRAZY as
they see Ellis' blood splattered on the glass walls on Hans'
office.
239     INT. HANS' OFFICE - ON HANS                         239
He throws open the door to let McClane and the police hear the
screams of the hostages.
HANS
Hear that?  Talk to me, where are my detonators.  Where are they or shall I shoot another one?  Sooner or later...(taking a shot)
...I might get to someone you do care about.
MCCLANE
(after a beat) Go fuck yourself.
He DISCONNECTS.
240     EXT. BUILDING                                       240
Powell fends off Robinson, who wants the CB.
ROBINSON
Goddamn, didn't you hear him!  He practically pulled the Goddamned trigger himself -- he gave that man to them --
POWELL
Christ, can't you read between the lines!  He did everything he could to save him...if he gave himself up they'd both be dead!
ROBINSON
Maybe.  And maybe they'd at least be talking to us!  Now tell your
'partner' to stay out of it, or so help me if he lives through this
I'll put him behind bars myself!
POWELL
(amused)
He's alone, tired, hunted, and hasn't seen diddly-squat from us and you think he gives a flying fuck about what you're going to do to him? Robinson, wake up and smell the shit you're shoveling!
ROBINSON
(cold)
Anytime you want to go home, Sergeant...consider yourself dismissed.
They lock eyes.
POWELL
No Sir.  You couldn't drag me away.
HANS' VOICE
(over CB)
Attention police.  Attention police.
It's asses and elbows time.  Tape recorders are started.
POWELL
(starting to speak)
This is --
ROBINSON
(taking the CB away)
This is Deputy Chief Robinson.  Who is this?

HANS
This is Hans Gruber.  I assume you realize the futility of direct action against me.  We have no wish for further loss of life.
ROBINSON
What do you wish for, Mister Gruber?
HANS
I have comrades in arms around the world who are languishing in prison. The American State Department enjoys rattling its saber to its own ends... now it can rattle it for me.

to dismay to outright derisive amusement.
HANS' VOICE
...The following people are to be released from their captors:  In
Northern Ireland, the seven members of the New Provo Front.  In Canada,the five imprisoned leaders of Liberte de Quebec...

KARL
(sotto)
'Asian Dawn Movement?'
HANS
(off-mike, a shrug)
I read about them in Time magazine.
(on mike)
When these Revolutionary Brothers and Sisters are Free, the hostages in this  building will be taken to the roof and
they will accompany us in helicopters to the Los Angeles International Airport where you will be given further
instructions.  You have two hours to comply.
ROBINSON
Two hours?  Are you insane?  I can't authorize...hello?  Hello?
KARL
Do you think they'll even try to do it?
HANS
Who cares?(on another channel) Theo.  Are we on schedule?

It's Christmas, Theo, it's the time of miracles.  So be of good cheer
and call me when you hit the last lock. (disconnecting) Karl...hunt the little shit down and get those detonators.

KARL
Franco is checking the explosives, Fritz is with him.
HANS
I'll check the explosives.  You just get those detonators.
245     MCCLANE - 32ND FLOOR                                 245
As he talks, he essentially PATROLS the floor he's staked
out, constantly looking into every dark corner, gun held
ready, moving toward the stairwell.
MCCLANE
Al?  Al, you there?
POWELL
I'm here, cowboy.
MCCLANE
Speaking of cows, did you ever hear so much bullshit in your life?
Two hours?  That doesn't even make any sense --
POWELL
Don't tell me, partner.  I'm just a desk jockey who was on the way
home when you rang.
MCCLANE
The way you drove that car, I figured you for the streets.
POWELL
In my youth, partner.  In my youth.
246     INT. TV STUDIO - NIGHT                               246
Gail and Harvey have company, a man from the Senator
Paul Simon's school of grooming.
GAIL
(in mid-speech) ...author of...(holding up a copy) 'Hostage/Terrorist, Terrorist/Hostage, a Study in Duality.'  Dr. Hasseldorf, what can we expect in the next few hours?
HASSELDORF
Well, Gail, by this time the hostages and their captors should be entering the early stages of the Helsinki Syndrome.
HARVEY
As in Helsinki, Sweden?
247     CONTROL ROOM                                          247
Sam sighs, shakes his head.
HASSELDORF
(over monitor) Uh...Finland.  Basically, it's when the hostages and the terrorists go through a sort of psychological transference and projection of dependency...
248     INT. NAKATOMI - HOSTAGE FLOOR                         248
Fritz drags Ellis' body out of the office and throws it on the
floor.
HASSELDORF
(over Hans' TV)
What can only be described as a strange sort of trust and bond
develops...We've had situations where hostages have embraced their captors after their release and in one case even corresponded with them in prison...
249     INT. BUILDING - MACHINE FLOOR                         249
Hans turns, looks up at the ceiling.  Too dim up there to see from here.  He sighs, sets his gun down on a buttress, starts to climb up, not enjoying it.
250-    OUT                                             OUT   250-

CUT TO:
254     OUTSIDE THE BUILDING                                  254
Robinson looks at a YOUNG COP, reacts, startled:
ROBINSON
The...the FBI?  Here?  Now?
YOUNG COP
Yessir.  Right over there.
Robinson looks at Powell, adjusts his clothing, fixes his tie.
POWELL
(dryly)
You want a breath mint?
Robinson glares at him, then they move together towards:
255     A BIG DARK GOVERNMENT CAR                             255
Headlights still on, dominating the area where it sits.  Robinson
steps up, sees:
256     HIS P.O.V. - FBI AGENTS                               256
They get out.  One big back lit SILHOUETTE, one little one.
BIG JOHNSON
(showing badge) I'm Special Agent Johnson of the FBI. This is Agent Johnson...no relation.
ROBINSON
(stepping forward, plastic smile) Dwayne Robinson, LAPD.  I'm in charge here.
BIG JOHNSON
Not any more.
As Robinson REACTS, we GO TO:
257     THE MECHANICAL FLOOR - TIGHT ON HANS                   257
He checks the plastique, not pleased.  He turns, DROPS to the
floor.
258     LOW ANGLE                                              258
He lands, knees bent...looks directly at a PAIR OF BARE FEET.
A GUN BARREL DROPS INTO THE SHOT close to his head.
MCCLANE
Lost?
259     NEW ANGLE                                              259
A moment.  And then Hans turns, looks up.
The transformation in his expression and bearing are mind-
boggling.  Hands shaking, eyes filled with fear, he swallows,
looks up at McClane and in a perfect American accent says:
HANS
--ohGodplease -- don't kill me -- don't kill me -- you're one of them,
I know it --
MCCLANE
(thrown, unsure)
Whoa, whoa, easy man.  I won't hurt you.  Who are you?  What are you looking for?
Hans' eyes dart towards:
260     THE BUTTRESS TEN FEET AWAY                             260
Where a tiny piece of his gun sticks out, barely visible.
261     BACK TO SCENE                                          261
HANS
A way up to the roof...I thought I could signal for help --
He starts in that direction.
MCCLANE
Forget it.  They got a guy up there. You want to stay alive, keep moving. Hey?  You hear me?
Hans realizes this tack won't work.  He follows McClane.
HANS
You...you're an American?
MCCLANE
(friendly, easing the man's fears) Only if New Jersey counts.
It works.  The poor frightened civilian shows a hint of a smile.
CUT TO:
261-A   OUTSIDE BUILDING                                       261-A
ROBINSON
(in mid-speech to FBI)
We've got thirty, maybe thirty-five hostages, probably on the 30th floor...seven, maybe eight terrorists.
LITTLE JOHNSON
(to Big Johnson) Sounds like a standard A-7 scenario.
Big Johnson nods in agreement, turns to Robinson.
BIG JOHNSON
Thank you.  We'll handle it from here.  When we need to commandeer your men, we'll try and let you know.
He starts to move away with his partner.
POWELL
(angry)Aren't you forgetting something?
Johnson and Johnson turn.  Robinson wants Powell to shut up.
BIG JOHNSON
Such as...?
POWELL
(pointing to the building) John McClane!  He's the man who gave
us all the information we've got! He's the reason you're facing seven
terrorists instead of twelve.
LITTLE JOHNSON
He's inside?  Who is he?
ROBINSON
(nodding) He may be a cop...we're checking on that --
BIG JOHNSON
One of yours?
ROBINSON
(too quickly) No, sir.
BIG JOHNSON
(after a moment)
If he's not a terrorist, and he's not a hostage...he's just not part of the equation.
They start to walk away.
POWELL
(indignant)
T...that's the same Goddamn thing the terrorists said!
LITTLE JOHNSON
(interested) Really? (to Big Johnson) That's one good thing.  Sound like we're dealing with pros.
They leave.
CUT TO:
262     THE COMPUTER FLOOR                                     262
McClane and Hans walk together.  Hans is still a "nervous wreck."
HANS
(nodding) There was a party -- celebration -- all of a sudden they were there -- shooting -- threatening us --
263     CLOSER SHOT                                            263
McClane looks at this poor civilian, on the edge of going to
pieces.  He puts his hand on his shoulder.
MCCLANE
Relax, man...you smoke?
Hans nods, still "frightened".  McClane takes out his spoils
of war, the Marlboros.  Two left.  He sighs, takes one, offers
the other one with an expression like a little boy forced to
share a cookie.  McClane takes out a lighter, does his and
Hans'.  Hans nods, grateful...then peers at McClane.
HANS
You...you don't work for Nakatomi... and if you're not one of them...
MCCLANE
I'm a cop from New York.
HANS
(puzzled) New York...
MCCLANE
(explaining) They invited me to the Xmas party. Who knew?
Hans' eyes take in his bare feet.
MCCLANE
Better than being caught with your pants down, right? (extending his hand) John McClane.
HANS
(shaking hands) William Clay. (smiling) Call me Bill.
McClane nods, friendly like, and his eyes glance casually over
at:
264     THE WALL - A ROSTER OF NAKATOMI EMPLOYEES              264
In alphabetical order.  CAMERA MOVES OVER the "c's":  CAMPBELL, S.: CLAY, WM.: CRAWFORD, L...PANS BACK TO CLAY.
265     BACK TO SCENE                                          265
MCCLANE Bill, you know how to use a handgun?
HANS (hesitant) One weekend I went to a combat ranch... (apologetic) You know, that game with the, the guns that shoot red paint?  Must sound pretty silly to you...
MCCLANE
Sounds better than nothing.
McClane takes out his Baretta, pops out the magazine, jams in
a fresh one and hands it to him.
MCCLANE
Time for the real thing.
McClane turns, moves on...we STAY ON him until he REACTS to a
CLICK.  He slowly turns:
265-A   NEW ANGLE                                              265-A
Hans is...well, Hans again, from expression to posture.  He
holds the pistol aimed at McClane's face and talks calmly into
his radio in German.
HANS
Karl!  Franco!  I'm on 33.  Come quickly. (to McClane) Put down your gun and give me my detonators.
McClane just looks at him.
MCCLANE
Hans.  Your Hans.
HANS
(nods, indicating McClane's gun again) Put it down now.
MCCLANE
That was tricky, with the accent. I bet you do a great Ed Sullivan.
Why do you need the detonators, Hans? I already used the explosives.
HANS
I'm going to count to three...
MCCLANE
(cold) Yeah.  Like you did with Takagi.
McClane raises his machine gun, aims at Hans.  Hans PULLS THE
TRIGGER.
Click.  Astonishment.  Click-click-click.  McClane steps in
carefully, reclaims his pistol.
MCCLANE
You think I'm a shmuch, Hans.
Hans pales as we hear the ding of an approaching elevator.
HANS
You were saying.
McClane whirls in time to see:
266-    OUT                                           OUT    266-
269                                                          269
260     KARL, FRANCO AND FRITZ                               270
Coming out of it, FIRING.
271     BACK TO SCENE                                        271
McClane FIRES back, killing Fritz.  Karl and Franco take
cover.  McClane ducks into a water cooler alcove, looks back
at:
272     WHERE HANS WAS                                       272
He's gone, a SWINGING OFFICE DOOR the only evidence of his
passing.
273     BACK TO SCENE                                        273
McClane curses himself, then RETREATS into a:
273-A-  OUT                                            OUT   273-A-

274     BANK OF COMPUTERS                                    274
Where he DUCKS and DODGES as bullets ping and ricochet all
around him.  Ducking, rolling, he FIRES at:
275     FRANCO                                               275
McClane's bullets RAKE his middle, throw him over a desk, his
weapon FLYING:
276     CLOSER                                               276
He SLIDES right into a glass door.  It smashes around his head.
Bright arterial BLOOD fountains up:
277     MCCLANE                                              277
hope rising at the prospect of an equal battle, his face
suddenly FALLS as BULLETS fly in from an unexpected direction.
He turns:
278     HANS                                                 278
has reappeared and snatched up Franco's weapon.
279     MCCLANE                                              279
FIRES, moving, trying to keep from bring flanked.  One of his
shots SHATTERS a glass panel, raining down shards near Hans,
who escapes with only superficial scratches.
280     HANS                                                 280
looks at the glass around him, gets an idea.  He SHOUTS to
Karl in German:
HANS
The glass!  Shoot the glass!
And, saying this, he demonstrates.  Karl follows suit.
281     MCCLANE                                              281
as GLASS FLIES EVERYWHERE, McClane sees one option, takes it.
BLASTING a burst to keep their heads down, he WHIRLS, JUMPS
on top of a long counter and RUNS ACROSS THE ROOM.  Their
BULLETS follow him, six inches behind his moving form!  Big
CRAY UNITS GROAN with electronic SQUEALS and SPARKS as a
million Gigabytes goes to RAM heaven.  McClane reaches the end
of the counter, DIVES and rolls to the floor:
282     HIS FOOT                                             282
goes right down on a jagged SHARD.  He GROANS, keeps going:
283     STAIRWELL DOOR                                       283
He's out, gone, safe!
284     BACK TO SCENE                                        284
Karl looks pissed as hell.  Behind him, Hans sifts through
rubble, then comes over, smiling.
He's holding the bag of detonators.
HANS
Smile, Karl.  We are back in business.

Mary comes inside, grinning ear to ear.  Thornburg looks up from
his danish, a cute little chin napkin protecting his shirt
collar.
THORNBURG
You got something?
MARY (waving a paper)Just McClane's name, badge number,
police record, vital statistics...(the ringer)..And his family's address right here in L.A.
As Thornburg GRINS we GO TO:
286     HOSTAGE FLOOR                                         286
Eddie and Uli are guarding the hostages.  Hans and Karl return.
Hans tosses the bag of detonators to Uli, who grins, leaves.
287     HOLLY AND GINNY                                       287
Holly has watched all this nervously.  But Ginny's eyes follow
Karl, who doesn't share the mood of the others.
GINNY
That one look pissed, Ms. Gennero...
HOLLY (relieved)Thank God. (explaining) He's still alive.

288     UPSTAIRS - WASHROOM                                   288
The door JARS open.  McClane all but crawls inside.  As he
passes the CAMERA we SEE his dragging foot leaving a trail
of blood on the linoleum.
CUT TO:
289     VAULT ROOM - SAME TIME                                289
Theo and Kristoff REACT, delighted, as they get the message
SIXTH LOCK DEACTIVATED.  Suddenly a BUZZER SOUNDS and the
graphic flashes:  "ELECTROMAGNETIC SEAL ENGAGED.  CANNOT

You better heat up that miracle   you were talking about.  We broke

291     INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT                                 291
Wincing in pain, McClane washes his foot in a sink basin.  He
washes a deep cut, soaps it, but the pain doesn't relent.
When a VOICE speaks, he JUMPS, realizes it's the CB.
POWELL
(on CB) Roy?  You still with us?
MCCLANE
Yeah.  But all things being equal, I'd rather be in Philadelphia.  By the way, chalk up two more terrorists.
INTERCUT:
292     POWELL - OUTSIDE                                      292
POWELL
They boys'll be glad.  We got a pool going on you.
McClane tries to wrap paper towels on the foot but his grimace
shows that is still hurts like hell.
MCCLANE
(through his teeth) Yeah?  What's the odds?
POWELL
You don't want to know.
Suddenly remembering an NYPD course in first aid from ten years
ago, McClane removes the improvised bandage, check the cut
more carefully.
MCCLANE
(as he work)
Put me down for twenty anyway...I'm good for it...so, what got you off the street, Al?  You liked lousy coffee, or what?
Powell doesn't answer right away.  At the same time, McClane
swallows, seeing a gleam inside his foot.  He gingerly probes,
and pulls out a shard of glass almost three inches long from its
angled gash, his mouth twisted in a silent scream all the way.
POWELL'S VOICE
I...realized I couldn't do what I had to anymore...at least not out
there.  I had an...accident.
McClane throws the glass across the room, forehead bathed in
sweat.
MCCLANE
(weakly) They way you drive, I can see why.
POWELL
(beat, serious) I...I shot a kid.
Realizing what he's hearing for the first time, McClane's face
shifts to a new kind of pain.
POWELL
(soft)
Eleven years ago.  Oh, it was dark... he was big for his age...damn ray gun he had looked real enough...yeah, I had all the right excuses...but afterwards... I really couldn't draw my gun again.
MCCLANE
I...I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to make a joke of it.
POWELL
(offhand) Hey, you couldn't know.
MCCLANE
I still feel like shit.
POWELL
Then this won't matter. (reluctantly) LAPD's not calling the shots anymore.
And as McClane REACTS we GO TO:
293     INT. VAULT ROOM - NIGHT                               293
Hans and Theo lean over a monitor watching a DWP truck near
the parking garage.
THEO                                  *
(tapping the screen) There's the city engineers...they're
going into the street circuits...But who are these guys in the suits?
HANS
That's the FBI...ordering them to cut  the building's power.  They're as regular as clockwork...or a time lock...
ON Theo's look:
HANS
...the circuits that cannot be cut... are cut automatically in reponse to a terrorist incident...You ask for miracles, Theo...I give you the FBI...
THEO
When you're hot, you're hot.
CUT TO:           *
294     EXT. BUILDING                                        294
As we saw on Theo's screen, the Johnsons and Robinson and
Powell are my a MANHOLE with a CITY ENGINEER.  A big CONTROL
BOX is there, cables snaking into the ground where another
CITY WORKER finishes WELDING a last connection.
GUY IN MANHOLE
We're spliced in down the line.
LITTLE JOHNSON
Do it...now.
The engineer THROWS GIANT LEVERS.  Inside the manhole, SPARKS
SIZZLE and massive contacts CLUNK.
295     THE BUILDING                                          295
One by one, all the light on all the floors GO OUT.
296     MCCLANE                                               296
in the bathroom, ripping off his shirt and tying it around his
foot, he REACTS --
MCCLANE
(into CB) Powell?  What's going on?
INTERCUT:
297     OUTSIDE                                               297
POWELL
(watching the others)
Ask the FBI.  They've got the terrorist playbook and they're running it, step by step.
McClane reacts, worried; he knows better.
298     THE HOSTAGES                                          298
groan with this new problem:
299     THE VAULT ROOM                                        299
Theo and Kristoff and Hans huddle over the computer monitor
screen as if it was a warm fireplace.  Theo points to the
computer screen; all they can do is wait.
We HEAR the HUMM of a portable generator.  The lights go OFF.
The computer screen stays ON.  Theo looks over at the safe.
300     SAFE LED READOUT                                      300
It still reads "FIBER OPTIC TIME LOCK CANNOT BE DISARMED AT
THIS LOCATION.  TERMINATE SEQUENCE (Y/N)?"
301     BACK TO SCENE                                         301
KRISTOFF
Damn!  It didn't go!
THEO
They're on the building circuit... it's too local.
HANS
Encourage them to be bolder.
THEO
The only thing left for them is the City Grid...(worried, typing)...They may not do it.
302     EXT. BUILDING                                         302
Just as the Johnsons are looking SMUG...all the floors GO
BACK ON, one by one!
LITTLE JOHNSON
Shit! (turning, to the Engineer) Cut it again.  Go wider.
ENGINEER
I can't go wider here... (to Robinson, looking
for help)...I'd have to call downtown have them take down one of the city grids...you're talking ten square block --
ROBINSON-- ten blocks? (to Big Johnson)
Are you crazy?  It's Christmas Eve, thousands of people -- the Mayor'll scream bloody murder --
BIG JOHNSON
(ignoring Robinson, to the Engineer)
We must shut down the building.  Go wider --!
ENGINEER
I need authorization --
BIG JOHNSON
Authorization?  How about the United States Fucking Government Lose the grid or lose your job!
The engineer looks at Robinson.  No help.  The engineer looks
at his guy in the manhole, shrugs.  No choice.
ENGINEER(takes phone) Central.  This is Walt, out at
Nakatomi.  I want you to shut down grid 212.
(listens)
No shit, it's my ass.  Just shut it down now.
Pause...pause...AND THEN THE FLOORS OF THE BUILDING ALL GO
OUT AGAIN.
303     IN THE VAULT ROOM                                     303
EMERGENCY LIGHTING FLICKS ON.   An ALARM "beep-beep-beeps."
304     THE LED READOUT ON THE SAFE                           304
changes to "FIBER OPTIC TIME LOCK DEACTIVATED AT SOURCE.
SEVENTH LOCK DISENGAGED."
305     BACK TO SCENE                                         305
With a dramatic HUM worthy of 2001, the vault door OPENS!
306     OUTSIDE                                               306
The FBI guys look at the dark building, than at the LAPD guys.
BIG JOHNSON
That should shake'em up.  With all the power shut down, those bastards are probably scared shitless.
307     IN THE VAULT ROOM                                     307
The safe door finishes its ponderous move, CLUNKS to a halt.
Theo and Kristoff LAUGH, give each other high fives.  Even Hans
loses his usual cool, slaps Theo on the back as Theo and
Kristoff CHEER.
CUT TO:
308     THORNBURG'S TV TRUCK                                  308
drives along a residential street.  We SEE the Nakatomi tower
in the b.g., spotlit by the police beams.  Thornburg checks a
map, POINTS a turn out to the driver.
CUT TO:
309     OUTSIDE THE NAKATOMI BUILDING                         309
Powell looks up at the dark structure lit only by emergency
lighting.  He sidles over to the FBI men.
POWELL
(dryly)
What do we do now, arrest them for not paying their electric bill?
LITTLE JOHNSON
(sharply)
We let them sweat awhile.  Then, when they're expecting helicopters...(pause)...We give them helicopters...
BIG JOHNSON
(nodding)
Right up the ass...(into another communicator)
This is Johnson...no the other one.  I want that air support ready to lift off in five minutes...Damn right fully armed.  We're on our way.
(into CB) Attention in the building.

310     VAULT ROOM                                            310
Hans talks while Theo and Kristoff tackle the problem of
unloading the racks and racks of bonds and transferring them
to the black cases.
HANS
This is Hans...
BIG JOHNSON
This is Agent Johnson of the FBI. The State Department has arranged for the release of your comrades.  The
helicopters you requested are on the way.
HANS
I hear you, FBI.  We'll be ready.
He disconnects, smiles at Theo.
HANS
When they touch down and we blow the roof, they'll spend a month sifting through the bodies and rubble.  By the time they figure out what went wrong...(smiling at the irony)...we'll be earning twenty percent like nice fat Capitalists.
BIG JOHNSON
(disconnecting, grinning)
By the time he figures out what hit him he'll be in a body bag.
The Johnsons exit.  Powell and Robinson look at each other,
unhappy.  Powell's CB HISSES --
MCCLANE'S VOICE
Powell, listen...
Powell moves off to be alone.
INTERCUT:
311     INT. BATHROOM                                         311
POWELL
I'm here, John.
McClane tries walking on his foot.  He winces in pain, clearly
at the end of his resources.
MCCLANE
(long pause)
Look...I'm getting a bad feeling up here...I'd like you to do something
for me.  Look up my wife...don't ask how, you'll know by then...and tell her...tell her...I've been a jerk. When things panned out for her, I
should've been behind her all the way ...We had something great going until I screwed it up...She was the best thing that ever happened to a bum like me.  She's heard me say I love you a thousand times, but she never got to hear this...honey...I'm sorry.
(pause) You get all that?
POWELL
(clearly touched)
I got it.  But you can tell her yourself.  Just watch your ass and
you'll make it.
MCCLANE
I hope so.  But that's up to the guy upstairs.
(pause; struck by a thought)
Upstairs...(thinking, to himself)...Hans, you bastard...what were you
doing?
POWELL
Roy?
MCCLANE
Stand by, Powell.  I gotta check something out.
He moves towards the door, limping hurriedly out of the room.
CUT TO:
312     HOLLY'S FRONT DOOR                                    312
Thornburg's got one foot literally in the doorway, but since
Paulina still has the chain on, it's not quite enough.
THORNBURG
(to Paulina)
One minute, that's all we ask.  You could be denying them their last
chance to talk to their parents.
PAULINA
I'm sorry...Mrs. Holly says I couldn't let strangers into --
THORNBURG
Strangers?  I'm with KFLW TV, that's affiliated with the FCC, and I'm sure you know that's the United States government...just like the INS?
As she wavers...
CUT TO:
313     THE MECHANICAL FLOOR                                  313
McClane hobbles in here, favoring his foot.  He retraces his
steps earlier, mentally replaying his meeting with Hans.
MCCLANE
I was here...he was...
His eyes flick over the area...then he looks up.  Seeing
something, he moves closer.  He sets down his CB and then, with
difficulty, he climbs up on a thick pipe, flicks his lighter
and hold its high.
314     HIS P.O.V.                                            314
Explosives are everywhere.
315     BACK TO SCENE                                         315
He reacts, quickly extinguishing the lighter.  He follows the
detonator lines with his eyes.
MCCLANE
Oh my God...
He drops to the floor, winces in pain, picks up his CB.
MCCLANE
Powell!  Powell, listen to me!  You're being double crossed!  The whole roof of this building is --
Suddenly a GUN BARREL is pressed against his head.  He stiffens.
316     NEW ANGLE                                             316

CB.  Smiling, Karl SMASHES the transmitter underfoot.

OFFICER
I did.  He said something about a, a double cross...
POWELL
(looking off) Tell me about it.
318     NEW ANGLE                                             318

CUT TO:
319     MACHINE FLOOR                                         319
Karl hovers over McClane, who hasn't moved a muscle.
KARL
(quietly)
We're both professionals.  But this is personal.  You...are done.
WHAM!  McClane DRIVES his elbow into Karl's face.
320     NEW ANGLE                                             320
Karl's weapon clatters on the floor.  McClane follows his first
blow with another.  Karl recovers, and with a spinning karate
kick SLAMS McClane back.

Eddie turns from a window, where the chopper lights loom closer.
EDDIE
They're coming.
CAMERA PANS across the room to the doorway of the office, where
Hans nods, stands.
THORNBURG'S VOICE FROM TV
-- I know you're proud of your daddy...
322     CLOSEUP - HOLLY                                       322
She's speechless, watching in shock as:
323     THE PORTABLE TV                                       323
shows Thornburg at Holly's house!  He's squatting down with his
microphone to interview the children in their P.J.s.  His voice
is soft, comforting.
THORNBURG
(to the children)
...because he's a very brave policeman. And your mom has shown just as much courage.  But is there something you would like to say to them if they're watching?
John Jr. says nothing, but Lucy looks at the camera.
LUCY
Come home.
324     HOLLY                                                 324
She struggles to stay composed...can't.  She slowly turns her
head, looks at Hans.
325     HER P.O.V. - HANS                                     325
He's looking away from us, at the picture of the children on
her desk.  He turns back and looks at her.  He smiles.
HANS
Mrs. McClane.  How nice to make your
acquaintance.
He raises his weapon...but he only shoot it into the ceiling,
making everyone jump!
HANS
(shouting)
On your feet, everyone!  Upstairs, now!
(quietly, to Uli) You'll lock them up there and come right down...
Uli nods and he and Eddie help herd everyone towards the stairs.
Hans moves forward...grabs Holly himself.
CUT TO:
326     THE MACHINE FLOOR                                     326
McClane and Karl move towards each other, each sizing the other
up, each looking over the terrain.
MCCLANE
Better this way, isn't it?  I mean, any faggot can shoot a gun.
This time Karl doesn't take the bait.  Then, when he
does charge, it's unexpected.
The two men fight brutally, Karl bringing years of martial
training to this moment, McClane bringing nothing but the street.
327     NEW ANGLE                                             327
MCCLANE
You should've heard your brother scream when I broke his fucking
neck...
Karl steps in quickly with a deadly move.  McClane twists free,
slams an elbow into Karl's kidney.  Karl backs off, circles
McClane with new respect.
CUT TO:
328     INSIDE AN FBI CHOPPER - IN FLIGHT                     328
THROUGH THE CANOPY we SEE another flanking chopper.  Johnson
and Johnson are here, helmets and mikes on.  Big Johnson checks
aerial maps while Little Johnson checks ammo clips for his
sniper scoped assault rifle.
BIG JOHNSON
(shouting, to the pilot)
Stay low.  They're expecting transports, not gunships.
LITTLE JOHNSON
(shouting over the noise of the rotors) What do you figure on breakage?
BIG JOHNSON
I figure we take out all the terrorists, and lose 20 percent of the hostages... 25, tops.
LITTLE JOHNSON
I can live with those numbers.
CUT TO:
329     VAULT FLOOR                                           329
Theo and Kristoff load the bonds into the big cases which carried
all their gear when they entered.  As Hans and Eddie come in they
look curiously at Holly.
HANS
A little bonus for us. (shoving her forward violently) A policeman's wife might come in handy.
He picks up a CB, speaks into it.
HANS
McClane!  McClane!  I have some news for you...McClane?
330     THE MACHINE FLOOR                                     330
TILT UP from the CB radio Karl smashed.
Karl and McClane are in the b.g., almost toe to toe, all their
tricks played out, going at it with animal instinct.
331     THE VAULT ROOM                                        331

Nothing.  He looks at Theo.
HANS
Hurry.
332     THE ROOF                                              332
Uli herds the hostages up onto the roof, pushing the last few
out.
333     LONG SHOT - FBI CHOPPERS - DOWN AVE. OF THE STARS     333
They float toward us, hugging the street, their prop wash
shaking the trees.
334     POWELL AND ROBINSON                                   334
Following them with their eyes, for once sharing the same opinion.
335     HOSTAGES ON THE ROOF                                  335
They see their very own Christmas decorations, the friendly
copter lights, and begin to smile and cheer.  Uli smiles to
himself, moves towards the door:
336     VAULT ROOM                                            336
Theo closes the lid of a bond-stuffed case, carries it out of
the room.  Holly's eyes follow his exit while the others continue.
HOLLY
(to Hans, scornfully)
After all your posturing, all your speeches...you're nothing but a common thief.
HANS
I'm an exceptional thief, Mrs. McClane. And now that I'm moving up to kidnapping, you should be more polite.
He SLAPS her.
337     MACHINE FLOOR                                         337
Karl drives McClane back with a sweeping head kick.  Another one.
McClane is staggering.  He gets in one hard punch and then Karl
charges at him.  McClane falls backwards, drives his legs
upwards, propelling Karl into the air:
338     LOW ANGLE                                             338
Karl goes into a loop of chain hanging over a turbine, becomes
entangled.
339     MCCLANE                                               339
jumps to his feet, yanks the other end of the chain.
340     KARL                                                  340
is JERKED upwards by the neck.  He TWITCHES like a captured
fish -- starts to turn blue:
341     MCCLANE                                               341
Twists the chain end around a pipe as Karl STILLS.  McClane
snatches up his Baretta from the floor, runs out.
CUT TO:
342     CHOPPERS - IN THE AIR                                 342
We can SEE the tailing 'chopper through the open port of this
one.  Big Johnson leans over, slaps the shoulder of his pilot.
BIG JOHNSON
Just like Saigon, eh, Wally?
PILOT
My kind of town.
CUT TO:
343     THE ROOF                                              343
The door rattles.  His back to the CAMERA, Uli goes to the door,
OPENS it -- and TWO BULLETS COME OUT HIS BACK.  Smoking Baretta
in hand, McClane vaults over the body before it has even stopped
twitching.  As the hostages SQUEAL and SCREAM, McClane snatches
up Uli's machine gun, runs out onto the roof.  He charges
through the crowd, spots Ginny near the edge of the roof.  She
meets him halfway.
MCCLANE
Where's Holly --
GINNY
The took her -- after they saw the
kids on television --
MCCLANE
What?  God --
He looks off to the choppers.  Closer yet.  He turns, SHOUTS.
MCCLANE
Listen to me!  All of you, get down
to the lower floors -- you're all
in danger.
HOSTAGE
What are you, crazy?  We're being
rescued!  Those helicopters --
MCCLANE
-- there won't be shit for those helicopters
to land on, because the whole top of this
building is wired with explosives!  Now
get below --
SECOND HOSTAGE
But...we're safe up here --
MCCLANE
Safe, my ass!  This ain't a helipad,
it's a launching pad!
And he FIRES over their heads!  They SCREAM, head for the door
as he hoped!  He FIRES again, raking a line across the roof.
They really haul ass.
MCCLANE
GET BELOW!  NOW!
344     IN THE WING CHOPPER - MID-AIR                         344
A YOUNG FBI AGENT is here with a rifle and a partner.

out the door)
Flight leader, this is Wing.  I think
they're on to us.  One of the terrorists

Something catches his eye.  He turns, looks at:
347     VIEW THROUGH WINDOW -- HIS P.O.V.                     347
Through the glass here he can catch a glimpse of the hostages
coming back into the room!
CUT TO:
348     THE ROOF                                              348
McClane herds the last of the hostages inside, starts for the
door himself, when with a ROAR and a CHATTER of rotors, the
lead chopper zooms overhead!  McClane throws himself down on the
ground, looks up as the chopper banks in a tight turn and then
from the open side GUNFIRE erupts!  Shocked, McClane DIVES out
of the way of the bullets that stitch across the door.
349     HOSTAGES - ON LOWER FLOORS (OR IN STAIRWELL)          349
descending, SCREAMING and HOWLING as a chopper SWEEPS past a
window on a loop back towards the roof.
350     IN THE CHOPPER                                        350
Both Johnsons FIRE AWAY
BIG JOHNSON
Bank and we'll nail him!
351     THE VAULT ROOM                                        351
Hans whirls towards Kristoff.
HANS
Blow the roof.  Now!
KRISTOFF
But Karl and Uli are up there --
CAMERA ADJUSTS to show the remote detonator on a table.  Hans
goes to it.
352     THE ROOF                                              352
McClane DIVES away from another burst.
MCCLANE
You assholes, I'm on your side -- !
They come in on another pass.  Desperate, he looks around, see
a fire hose.  Makes up his mind.  With the chopper LOOMING UP
behind him, he slings Uli's weapon, runs to the fire hose,
unreels three yards, loops it around his back and under his legs.
He looks over the edge, hesitates:
MCCLANE
Fuck this...
Bullets HIT all around him.  He JUMPS:
353     THE VAULT ROOM                                        353
Hans extends the antenna...HITS the button.
354     LONG SHOT - THE ROOF                                  354
The helipad EXPLODES!  A FIREBALL rolls into the sky.
355     THE HOSTAGES                                          355
lose their footing on the floor.  Dust and debris fall down,
but they're okay.
356     JOHNSON AND JOHNSON'S CHOPPER                         356
STRAINS to avoid the rising fireball...can't!  It's CAUGHT in
the explosion!  It tips over, a rotor hits the roof -- it
CRASHES, EXPLODES, tumbles down the side of the building!
357     MCCLANE                                               357
Dangling against the side of the building, he DUCKS and winces
as FLAMING DEBRIS soar past him.
358     THE ROOF - HOSE WHEEL DEVICE                          358
Flame ROARS TOWARDS it, engulfs it.  It JERKS on its foundation
PIVOTS 180 degrees as several bolts slip:
359     MCCLANE                                               359
DROPS several more feet.  He swallows, then KICKS against the
side of the building, his bloody feet leaving smears.  The
shatterproof glass doesn't budge!  Wincing as more FLAMING DEBRIS
sizzles by, McClane levels the machine gun, KICKS off from the
building, SWINGS back ten feet -- reaches the zenith of his
arc -- FIRES the gun and sails back in:
360     INSIDE THE BUILDING                                   360
McClane SMASHES through the shattered glass, SAILS inside, rolls
onto the floor, PLOWING through furniture and decor.  Finally
he STOPS, catches his breath with relief...rises to one knee:
361     UP ON THE ROOF                                        361
The fire hose mounting is BLASTED off the roof, SAILS past the
CAMERA:
362     OUTSIDE THE BUILDING                                  362
The hose mechanism tumbles downward!
363     INSIDE                                                363
McClane is YANKED off his feet, dragged towards the window!
364     THE HOSE WHEEL - OUTSIDE                              364
It SLIDES down the side of the building!  The hose PLAYS OUT
on the edge of the windowsill, dragging McClane towards his death!
365     MCCLANE                                               365
CLAWS at the floor...no help.  Inches from the shattered window,
he braces his legs against the sill, groans as he fights the
weight of the hose and the reel.  One foot SLIPS.  Only his
already wounded foot keeps him indoors.
He scrambles to untie his improvised rappeling rig -- gets free
just before the hose nozzle CRASHES out and into the great beyond!
Winded, strength ebbing, he staggers to his feet -- just in time
for:
366     THE ROOF                                              366
to RECOIL from another staggering explosion!
367     THE HOSTAGES                                          367
They scream, cry out:
368     IN THE VAULT ROOM                                     368
As Holly covers her head from falling plaster, the men work
like automatons, piling up the bonds.
369     MCCLANE                                               369
recovers from another AFTERSHOCK, runs up the steps -- is
momentarily amazed to HEAR a "ding" from the elevator -- he looks
at:
370     THE SHAFT                                             370
where suddenly the WALL EXPLODES OUTWARD as an ENTIRE ELEVATOR
CRASHES THROUGH THE WALL, swinging on its cable like a
demolition ball on a crane!
371     BACK TO SCENE                                         371
McClane runs up the steps as brickwork flies past his head like
schrapnel:
372     THE ELEVATOR                                          372
reaches the apex of its swing, drops down in an arcing turn:
373     WIDE SHOT                                             373
the elevator CRASHES into the stairs!  The section McClane in
on SNAPS LOOSE!  At the last minute McClane LEAPS towards:
374     THE VAULT FLOOR BALCONY                               374
and catches it as stairs and elevator CRUMBLE behind and beneath
him!  With his last effort, he hauls himself onto the balcony
and them moves off!
CUT TO:
375     EXT. BUILDING                                         375
The police are scrambling for cover.  Powell and Robinson are
open-mouthed.
376     IN THE BASEMENT                                       376
Argyle is huddled down on the floor of the back seat, the stuffed
animal held over his head as much for company as protection.
As the building ceases to ROCK Argyle sneaks a peek out from
under the fur...and sees:
377     HIS P.O.V. - THEO                                     377
at the delivery truck.  He steps into a white paramedic's
jumpsuit and zips it up.  He hops into the cab and pulls the
truck away from the loading dock.
378     MCCLANE - ON THE VAULT FLOOR                          378
He creeps forward, looks carefully into:
379     HIS P.O.V. - VAULT ROOM                               379
They're getting ready to leave with the bearer bonds.  Suddenly
the CAMERA FOCUS CHANGES TO HOLLY.
380     BACK TO SCENE                                         380
McClane's face shows his anguish.  He checks the weapon he took
from Uli.  One bullet!
MCCLANE
(under his breath)
Shit...
He checks his Baretta.  One bullet.  He thinks, desperate.
Decides.  He takes the bullet from the rifle clip, adds it to
the Baretta clip.  He slams the pistol clip back, really worried.
Mind racing, he looks all around the room...his eyes fall on a
tape dispenser.  He thinks again...steps towards it:
380-A   IN THE BASEMENT                                       380-A
Theo has pulled two ramps out from the truck and slips into
the back.  A car engine fires up inside the delivery truck.
381     ARGYLE                                                381
Realization dawning, he vaults into the front seat.
382     THE GARAGE                                            382
A paramedic van shoots out of the back of the Pacific Courier
delivery truck.  Flooring the limo, Argyle CRASHES into
the van, which CAREENS into the wall.
383     CLOSER                                                383
Theo staggers out in time for Argyle to deck him with one punch.
ARGYLE
(looking around)
Where's the camera when you need them?
CUT TO:
384     THE VAULT ROOM                                        384
HANS
Let's move.
The last of the money is piled on.  Hans hangs onto Holly while
Eddie pushes the mail carts of moneybags.  Kristoff goes to the
door to scope their escape...suddenly he is COLD COCKED by a
rifle butt.
385     WIDER                                                 385
McClane steps into view in the doorway, backlit by sparks still
tumbling down from the roof above.  He holds the machine gun
ready.
MCCLANE
Hans!
Hans turns, not that surprised.  Grinning, he yanks Holly into
view.  No words need be said.
HOLLY
John!
MCCLANE
Holly, we have to stop meeting like
this.
(taking in the vault)
So that's what it was.  A fucking
robbery.
(thinking)
So why nuke the building, Hans?
HANS
(with a shrug)
When you steal six hundred dollars,
you can disappear...but when you
steal six hundred million, they will
find you...unless you play dead.
(tight smile)
Which happens to be your next role...
drop your gun, please.
McClane hesitates...Hans pushes the gun against Holly again,
really hurting her.  Eddie quickly raises his weapon.
HANS
(to Eddie)
Nein, dies ein ist mein.
(to McClane)
This time John Wayne does not walk
off into the sunset with Grace Kelly.
MCCLANE
That was Gary Cooper, shithead...
HANS
No more jokes, drop it or she gets it
between the eyes!
MCCLANE
(slowly putting down
his gun)
Whoa, Hans, now you're the cowboy?
HANS
'Yippe-ki-yea, mother fucker'?  Now
you are fucked.
He aims:
MCCLANE
Holly, now...!
Instantly, Holly sidesteps, JABS her elbow into Hans' face!
386     MCCLANE - OVER SHOULDER SHOT                          386
At the same moment Holly moves, McClane grabs his Baretta
from its hiding place TAPED TO THE BACK OF HIS NECK, SHOOTS
Hans high in the chest!
The bullet passes right THROUGH Hans, and the WINDOW behind
him SPLATTERS with blood and SHATTERS.  Even while this is
happening, McClane SPINS:
387     EDDIE - THROUGH MCCLANE'S WIDESPREAD LEGS             387
Eddie takes a gunshot, DROPS just like on Gunsmoke.
388     BACK TO SCENE                                         388
Hans drops his weapon, staggers, looks down at his own blood
in shock.
389     MCCLANE                                               389
MCCLANE
You were right about us Americans.
(he blows smoke
from his pistol
barrel)
We are cowboys.
390     VAULT ROOM - WIDER                                    390
Incredibly, Hans still stands, eyes filled with shock and
disbelief.  He REELS, falls against the windowsill, starts to
TOPPLE -- and then he GRITS his teeth and from some inward
place finds a last reserve of strength and he GRABS:
391     HOLLY'S WRIST                                         391
and she is YANKED off her feet!
392     BACK TO SCENE                                         392
Hans goes out the window, pulling Holly with him!  McClane
LEAPS forward, catches her inside arm near the elbow at the
last minute!
393     EXT. BUILDING - LONG SHOT                             393
The roof still in flames, McClane hangs halfway out of the
window, jagged glass raking his face, straining to hold onto
Holly as Hans drags her out!
McClane braces himself against the window frame and strains to
pull Holly closer.  With a MOAN, she catches the windowsill with
her inside hand.  McClane STRETCHES with his other hand, begins
to INCH towards Holly's wristband.
394     HANS' HAND - WIDEN                                    394
A death grip on the watchband.  We WIDEN, SEE that, blood
flecked teeth GRITTING, he is STRAINING with his other hand
to bring up the gun he is still holding!
395     MCCLANE                                               395
Holly's SCREAM alerts him.  Hans locks eyes with McClane one
last time, starts to pull the trigger, as:
396     VERY CLOSE                                            396
McClane RELEASES the latch on the watchband!  The overtaxed
metal SNAPS, links flying:
397     WIDER                                                 397
Hans' face registers his horror as he and most of the watch
suddenly drop.
We LISTEN to his scream all the way down, finally HEAR him HIT.
McClane pulls Holly back into the room and holds her.
MCCLANE
It's okay, babe.  It's okay.
He looks down at Hans' body, then back at the scrap of wristband
he's still holding.
MCCLANE
You got a warranty on this?
She laughs through her tears, holds onto him.
DISSOLVE TO:
398     EXT. BUILDING - DAWN                                  398
Smoke drifts up from what has suddenly become the top floor.
Thornburg's remote truck careens into the parking lot.
399     CLOSER                                                399
A crowd watches as the front doors of the building open.  We
SEE McClane, who holds up Holly and in turn is supported by
SWAT men.  As REPORTERS start shouting questions, McClane
breaks free of his entourage, and, holding Holly, pushes into
the crowd.
MCCLANE
(calling out)
Al?  Al, you here -- ?
The crowd eddys and surges...suddenly Powell is there, and
McClane knows it's him.  They stare at each other, ten feet
apart, and then they're grinning, extending their hands.  But
somehow a shake isn't enough, and they're embracing each other
like men who've lived through combat together...which, in fact,
is the truth.
MCCLANE
(emotional)
Al.  Man, you were my rock.  I
couldn't have made it without you.
POWELL
Bullshit.
MCCLANE
I'm serious.  Hey, this is my wife...
Holly Gennero.
HOLLY
(taking Powell's hand,
correcting)
Holly McClane.
Hearing this, McClane grins, pulls her close.                 *
POWELL
(to her)
A pleasure.  I guess John doesn't
need me to give you that message
anymore.
HOLLY
(puzzled)
Message?
McClane begins to make silent "ixney" gestures in Powell's
direction.
POWELL
You know, about him being such a
jerk -- and how he's really sor --
(seeing McClane)
-- ee...Uh, I'm sure he'll fill
you in.
Just then Robinson barges forward.
ROBINSON
I want you for debrief, McClane.
You've got some things to answer
for -- Ellis' murder -- property
damage -- interfering with police                    *
business --
A SCREAM causes McClane to turn.
400     HIS P.O.V.                                            400
There in the doorway is Karl, clothing and body scorched.
Easily as crusted in dirt and blood as McClane, he holds his
machine gun.
401     EXT. BUILDING                                         401
As the crowd panics trying to escape, Karl locks eyes with
McClane and levels his gun.  McClane throws Holly to the
ground and grabs the dumbstruck Robinson's sidearm.
But he doesn't get off a shot -- a lone gunshot stops Karl --
knocking him back through the doorway.  McClane looks back to
see Powell still sighting down the barrel of his .38.
His hand is rock steady.  He sees McClane's look.
POWELL
(shrugging)
You were right.  You couldn't have
made it without me.
They smile.  Suddenly McClane and Holly squint as LIGHTS pan
onto them.  Thornburg pushes his way forward, mike extended
like a weapon.
THORNBURG
Mr. McClane...Mrs. McClane...any
comment on your incredible ordeal?
What are your feelings now that it's
all over?
Without a beat, Holly PUNCHES HIM in the chops.  He FALLS,
dropping the mike with an electronic SQUEAL.  McClane looks at
his wife, amazed.  Behind them, Thornburg sits on the ground, *
nurses his lip, turns to his camerman.
THORNBURG
(eager)                                       *
Did you get that?
McClane and Holly continue on, turn towards:                  *
402     ARGYLE'S LIMO                                         402
It's a little smashed up, but still running.  Argyle is
standing beside the open door.  McClane and Holly get in and
Argyle closes the door.
ARGYLE
(getting in the
front)
If this is their idea of Christmas
I gotta be there for New Year's.
CAMERA ADJUSTS TO SHOW the read window where McClane and
Holly are kissing.  As they drive off, we:
FADE OUT
