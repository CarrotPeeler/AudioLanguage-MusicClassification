4 ContributorsLouise LyricsI watched you move - so self assured
So merciless - so quiet
You chose your prey - eyes cold and grey
You feel compelled - to try it
A panther's walk - a panther's talk
A million men - still buy it
Any woman could see -
What you were trying to do - to me
LOUISE can't see the wood for the trees
Why don't you leave well alone
When love's in its home
Woman to Woman - oh, please
You're dressed to kill - you always will
Need heads to keep on turning
Love's not skin deep - it's hard to keep
It's what you're never learning
Any woman could see -
What you were trying to do to me
LOUISE can't see the wood for the trees
Why don't you leave well alone
When love's in its home
Woman to Woman - oh, please

When love's in its home

Oh, I'm begging you please - to its kneesEmbed
