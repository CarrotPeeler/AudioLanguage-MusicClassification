6 ContributorsSky Away Lyrics
Sky, Sky Away
Sky, Sky Away...

I'm so silly thinking of my life (peaceful with you)
No one ever made me feel the way (that I do with you with you)
Still, even so I've got so much to learn (About Love)
But if what I felt with you is not (Then what was?)
Whenever I was in your arms (I was filled with joy)
And no one else could tell me you weren't mine (and I wasn't yours)
The look upon my face couldn't express (my feelings baby)
No words could leave my mouth to explain (just Sky away)

I close my eyes
My heart flies
My soul lies
Another Day, I sky away
Into the clouds
Butterflies
Where sun rises happen all day
I sky away

Whatever happened to the love we gave? (With me and you)
When everyone insisted that I love (Wasn't even true)
We tried so hard to make sure that we proved (We proved 'em wrong)
But now all that has changed And I am here (While you are gone)
I miss the days, miles away, on the phone (Wishing you were there)
And all the wonderful things that you said (Let me know you care)
I miss the nights we spent, all the moments, (No one can take)
But most of all, I miss just being with you (SKY AWAY)
You might also like
I close my eyes
My heart flies
My soul lies
Another Day, I sky away
Into the clouds
Butterflies
Where sun rises happen all day
I sky away

Stars and rainbows light up the way
All the spoken words that one can say
Unicorns laugh as we lay
In the field of the reality
Hand and hand we walk, as you'll say
How much you miss me and you care for me
Baby, I'm praying that someday
I'll close my eyes and you'll be there to sky away
With me

Sky away, Sky away
With me
Sky Away
