1 Contributor200 Years LyricsThe... emperor wears no clothers The
Emperor wears no clothers The
Emperor wears no clothers He
Don't like none of those 200
Years in which I spit That's
Too many years in babylon So
You know we're leavin it 200
Years in which I spit That's
Too many years in babylon So
You know we're leaving it G
Love. What's
Going on Little
Sister born in 1976 A
Bicentennial of 200 years On
Which I spit Look
How you're living first world Look
What you did to third world So
Many rhymes in flame so, many bodies slain Stories
Washed in the red stain Bring
Our boys back home God
Bless our troops Who
Execute their orders Their
Living breathin gorders Somebody's
Sons Somebody's
Daughters Bodies
Thrown in the garbage chutes You're
Lying sweat behind those suits American
Casualties 16 That's
16 concrete sweet dreams What
About the 4000 buried in 16 graves That
The bulldozer made The
Presidaent gave Didn't
Reach the middle Before
They reached the last page Their
Mothers crying Torn
Enraged, They
Didn't know oall of the statistics Information
Unclear And
The truth never reached it Enemy
Resistance gone 'cause we breached it Evidence
Gone white 'cause we bleached it 200
Years in which I spit That's
Too many years in babylon So
You know we're leaving it 200
Years in which I spit That's
Too many years in babylon So
You know we're leaving it Smiles
You might also likeLet
Us puff today Stay
True I way The
Golden bonfire No
Burn the soul body Won't
Walk through the secret entrance Nor
I stroll down the streets of gold Live
And breathe with one guide One
Mind and one home Come
On people let's realize All
The families must be unified Come
On people let's realize Babylon
Trickin' with dem foolish lies Come
On people let's realize All
The families must be unified Never
Will we cower Never
Will we hide Now
We're steppin' out of babylon And
We wavin' good byeEmbed
