2 ContributorsFrom a Whisper to a Scream Lyrics
From a whisper in the wind to a loud, loud scream
A message came that I'd lost you
All to the warmth of another woman
For Heaven sakes, baby, I'm begging you, just don't leave me

I've seen more tears fall from your eyes
Than all the showers of April
I took kindness for granted
As if it came with the wallpaper

Lord, so inconsiderate of how much you cared
For some stupid reason I just thought you had to be there

Oh my love, oh my love, oh my love
Baby, baby, baby, please don't leave me
I'm begging you, I'm on my knees now, baby

I simply must have been crazy
I must have been out of my mind
To over look the need in you
Lord, how could I have been so blind?
You might also like
Lord, Lord, never giving thoughts to your wants and needs
But now I'm begging, baby, please, please, please

Oh my love, oh my love, oh my love
I'm begging you, my love

Hey, so inconsiderate of how much you cared
For some stupid reason I just thought you had to be there

Oh my love, oh my love, oh my love
Talking about my love

Never giving thoughts to your wants and needs
Now I'm begging you, baby, please, please, please

Oh my love, my love, my love
Baby, just don't leave me now

Oh my love, oh my love
Oh my love, oh my loveEmbed
