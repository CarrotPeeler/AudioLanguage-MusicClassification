5 ContributorsBritish Summertime Lyrics
Leaving at dawn to beat the traffic
Do you remember that too?
Curled asleep on the back seat
Do you remember that too?

The soundless dark, the empty road
Do you remember that too?
And that child asleep, only eight years old
Do you recognise as you?

June, July, September
Stretched ahead and out of view
The whole world seemed a safe place
And never ending too

But it was never as simple as you thought
There were just things you never knew
And up ahead your parents bore the weight
Of all their worries and yours too

Windows down on the coast road
Wanting to be first to see the sea
The whole world seemed a safe place
Temporarily
You might also like
But it was never as simple as you thought
And you found out as you grew
That up ahead your parents had borne the weight
Of all their worries and yours too
All their worries and yours tooEmbed
