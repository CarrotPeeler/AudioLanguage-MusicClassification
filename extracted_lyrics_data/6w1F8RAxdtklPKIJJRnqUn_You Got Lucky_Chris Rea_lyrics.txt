2 ContributorsYou Got Lucky LyricsDon't go looking for a reason
There's nothing here to see
What you are, everything you done
Is how it all came to be
The telephone is ringing
But not for you
The angels keep on singing
But for somebody new
You threw away so much you had
There's no-one left to hear you call
And it's all because got lucky
You try to work it out
But ain't got a clue
You try to find out
What everybody knew
You started to believe it
Now you find it hard to understand
How could you lose it
With such a winning hand
Now there's no-one
To care about you
If you should jump or fall
And it's all, because
You got luckyYou might also likeEmbed
