Love's a silver bullet that blows your world apart
I wanna be remembered as an outlaw, honey
The boy who stole your heart
I wanna be the guy who wares the white hat
And rides across the plain
I'm gonna be your enigmatic stranger, honey
You're looking at your Shane
Cowboy dreams, cowboy dreams
You give me cowboy dreams
Cowboy dreams, cowboy dreams
You give me cowboy dreams
If ever you're in trouble, if ever you are down
I'm gonna be the hanging judge and sherif
Gonna ride your troubles out of town
You're looking at a mountain
You're looking at the law
You're looking at a six gun legend - fastest on the draw
Cowboy dreams, cowboy dreams
You give me cowboy dreams
Cowboy dreams, cowboy dreams
You give me cowboy dreams
You might also likeI can make you happy, it's easier than it seems
I'm gonna ambush you at sundown
Gonna give you cowboy dreams
Yippi ay yeah
I'm gonna give you cowboy dreams
Love's a silver bullet that blows your world apart
I wanna have it written on my tombstone
Here lies the boy who stole your heart
Yippi ay yeah
Cowboy dreams
You give me cowboy dreamsEmbed
