1 ContributorOn The Edge Lyrics
I've changed my world
When you were away
I'm waiting
That is my truth
Without you
That is my escape

I close my eyes
You disappeared behind the door of my heart
I can't listen to your lies
I don't hear bitter words

I can't look back
I search for my love
I search for my luck
I can't be taken care of

I close my eyes
You disappeared behind the door of my heart
I can't listen to your lies
I don't hear bitter words
You might also likeI close my eyes
You disappeared behind the door of my heart
I can't listen to your lies
I don't hear bitter words

This time has been lost
Never were together
And never will be
Now you suffer the most

You light my fire, you light my fire, when I fall
You light my fire, you light my fire, when I fall
You light my fire, you light my fire, when I fall
You light my fire, you light my fire, when I fall

I close my eyes
You disappeared behind the door of my heart
I can't listen to your lies
I don't hear bitter words
I close my eyes
You disappeared behind the door of my heart
I can't listen to your lies
I don't hear bitter wordsEmbed
