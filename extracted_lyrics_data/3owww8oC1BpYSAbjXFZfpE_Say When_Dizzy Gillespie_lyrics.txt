1 ContributorTroublemaker Lyrics
When Mont Dizzy Gillespie, Veteran young Makaveli
And Terrance Moore hit record you can pour the confetti
More than ready, we willing
To take the game like a villain
Spilling whiskey on the wooden floor
Working hard we tryna blow
Hickies all up on her throat
She loves that sensual shit
But I ain't always got time for it
The sheen on that wristwatch a clean ass sign of it
The time that is
When I'm bombing shit, back off
I'll never quit, cause that's soft
When bagging broads, I'm a rebel without a cause
Don't need your applause
Like a wrecking ball
Breaking walls down
If we talking 'bout $10 million, what the fuck is six spent
To get my Mom a brand new house, full bank account and fresh kicks
Uh, I'm sticking to the G code
Cause all the people we know
Are good people, but bad negroes
Had equals, but now they zeroes
Fight like LaMotta, for deniro I'm De Niro
Lead actor pose, you already know
Principle photography, hope everybody see the show
Don't need no gold to glow, master speaker flow
Grab the weed and blow
I need to quit, cause everything I speak is dope
Til my crowd crazy big, like they tryna see the pope
My delivery, get the cheese, 'til my dough roll like a pizza store
You might also like x2
I don't wanna make trouble
I'm just tryna leave the struggle
Yeah
And scared money don't make no money
If I ever rob dog, bet I take your money
Wassup

Oh shit, who that be?
Be that nigga V-E-T
Infinitely repping R-E-T-R-O
You know, and they know
And she knows, and he knows
Bet I been teaching them, the GPA's only a 2.0
Fuck 'em though
Cause it's we with that degree on how a emcee spits the heat
We been waiting on that bread, we been built our bakery
With our booming ass business, and the business is the truth
Truthfully, I'm realizing that the 'Brons match the coupe
White body, red trim, I'm blowing up the finish line
Tomorrow I'll begin, cause you're needing all the time
Watch as a nigga roll, the weed be at it's finest
The world couldn't find us, shit them niggas was behind us
These haters call me highness, they hate it
They love the fact the rap industry has yet to pay us
But they stacking up our racks
Our racks on top of racks
Our racks with money and the racks with women scratching backs
I'm giving her that chocolate like she ordered Starbucks frap-
Pacino equals me, I won't get shot in the back
Crew's ready to attack, to make your bone snap
You sleeping on me, you'll have to see your chiroprac-
A spine is what these pussy ass niggas really lack
These troublemakers start to hack this beat with an axe
Take your money
Wassup

Troublemaker, I am
Bread like Anita Baker
Sweet loving, I'm kicking
You can call it David Akers
I don't give two fucks
Throw up both my middle fingers
Making all these bitches wet, I'm like an R&B singer
Know I'm smashing these hoes, I'm gone end up in the sheets
And I'm smashing these flows, I'm like Hulk up on these beats
All these calls coming in, they forward to my secretary
Picking six of these hoes, who fucking with my secondary
Nobody, know you seen that Maserati
Or that black and white Bugatti
Doing endoes on Ducatis
Blowing indo (indo)
Killing instrumentals
Fresh like Mentos, that's your car, nah that's rental
Every single night, yeah I'm out here on the grind
Kinda think I'm going crazy, but my Moms tells me I'm fine
Aw, yeah
Yeah my Moms tells me I'm fine, but she my Moms
So she say that, but I kinda think she lying
Yet, I'm still up in this club, watching all these hoes walk by
Spot a bad chick in leopard she a wild kind of fine
Wassup
 x2

Don't start no shit, won't be no shit
Don't start no shit, won't be no shit
Bring your body where nobody can see, yeahEmbed
