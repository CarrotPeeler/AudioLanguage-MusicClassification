Where in the world did I get this hurt
I don't mind, I don't mind
If you call me bad, call me wrong
Call me anything but your own
I don't mind, I don't mind
I don't care if you leave me
I don't care if you go away
I don't care if you wanted this
I don't mind
Break it up, break it up, break it up, break it up, my love
If you think that you can't stay with me then break it up my love
Break it up, just break it up, break it up, just break it up
So where in the world, where in the world
Where in the world can I hide this hurt
I don't mind, I don't mind
If you call me sad, call me strong
Strong enough to make it on my own
'Cause I don't mind, I don't mind
If you tear down your walls inside
Go for a brandnew ride
But babe please don't tell me so
