And its wisdom and visions are you
(Baby baby, there's no returning)

Only you can ensure everlasting

Jimmy, if you only knew all that I felt for you
You wouldn't question me with a doubt
Jimmy, my heart is full of love, only true love
And its wisdom and visions are you

Only you can ensure everlasting
(Baby baby, my love is you)
