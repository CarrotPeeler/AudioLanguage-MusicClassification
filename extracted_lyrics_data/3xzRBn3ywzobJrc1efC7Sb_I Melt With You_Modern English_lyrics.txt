42 ContributorsI Melt with You Lyrics
Moving forwards, using all my breath
Making love to you was never second best
I saw the world crashing all around your face
Never really knowing it was always
Mesh and lace

I'll stop the world and melt with you
You've seen the difference
And it's getting better all the time
There's nothing you and I won't do
I'll stop the world and melt with you

Dream of better lives
The kind which never hate
Trapped in a state of imaginary grace
I made a pilgrimage
To save this human's race
Never comprehending
The race had long gone by

I'll stop the world and melt with you
You've seen the difference
And it's getting better all the time
There's nothing you and I won't do
I'll stop the world and melt with you
You might also like
The future's open wide
The future's open wide

I'll stop the world and melt with you
I've seen some changes
But it's getting better all the time
There's nothing you and I won't do
I'll stop the world and melt with you

The future's open wide
Hmm hmm hmm
Hmm hmm hmm hmm
Hmm hmm hmm
Hmm hmm hmm hmm

I'll stop the world and melt with you
You've seen the difference
And it's getting better all the time
There's nothing you and I won't do
I'll stop the world and melt with you
I'll stop the world and melt with you
I'll stop the world and melt with you
I'll stop the world and melt with you
I'll stop the world and melt with you6Embed
