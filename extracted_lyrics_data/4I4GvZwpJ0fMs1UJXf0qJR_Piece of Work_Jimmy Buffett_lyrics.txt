3 ContributorsPiece of Work Lyrics
I'm a piece of work, I'm iron and lace
I'm shy right up there in your face
I'm all dumbfounded, stubborn as an ass
Sharp as an arrow in a pile of glass
I'm a sweetheart, genius, restless jerk
Lord have mercy, I'm a piece of work

Well, the Lord made me on a long thin limb
Made sure I'd remember him
Or her in the middle of a long dark night
Creation crazy, death sheet white
Made in the image of a lion shocked lamb
I am who the hell I am
Never better, bad or worse
Down to the letter, I'm a piece of work

I'm a piece of work, I'm an angel's fiend
Bathed in lavender and gasoline
Scared, brave, shallow in an ink black well
Lightly browned in the fires of hell
Wicked, holy, full-on fake
Best known for my big mistake
I'm a Zen, wise, peaceful, gone berserk
Good God almighty, I'm a piece of work
You might also like
I'm a dreadful sight and I just don't care
Spent all morning pulling out my hair
Woke at dawn with a crazy spin
Half the day trying to glue back in
Mother, Bloody Mary please
Wipe that smile right off of your knees
I'm a CEO of the mailroom clerks
Lord have mercy, what a piece of work

I'm a piece of work, I'm a lovesick boy
Cloth cap, caviar and corduroy
All over the map, just lost in space
With a filthy mind and a choir boy's face
Heels up, head down, straight on through
Watch out, woman, I'ma get to you
I'm a gladiator with a mind to irk
Good God almighty, I'm a piece of work

I'm a piece of work
I'm a piece of work
I'm a piece of workEmbed
