1 ContributorB. Dot vs Stricc Lyrics
Look before you even start, you should stop hatin'
"You’re white with a-" suck my cock-asian (Caucasian)
Look, y'all seen him, right? Try to stare me down
You think that gon' scare me clown?
When you look like a weak fuck, yo’ mean mug don't mean much
He came with explosive material just to die, he a suicide bomber
He did Fiji cold now he assume he ice water
Well I'm breakin' that myth
Fuck debatable, I'm takin' that shit
He knew he was gonna be a good pop when he saw the way I was raisin' that fist
So when I smash his dome, palindrome
Playa that's sick, cause I’ma land with so many crazy ass hits
It’s clear even if we ran it back it's be the same exact shit
So bodies weren’t meant for punches, just sloppy than a bitch
I'll shake bones if I connect wit' Dot, he's soft as it can get
Let me find out the number to his apartment and address
I don’t play, so I knock, while you was talkin' all that mess
Now you got a target on your chest
My whole crew got a revolver in each hand, we brought it from the west to see who's posse is the best
I'll let that six six start it, then it's a domino effect
Why? Cause I don't like preacher dudes like you
Always talkin' 'bout ya story and the message that it tells
From 14 to 25, I spent 8 of those 11 years in jail
Writin' letters in my cell workin' on bettering myself
Just to have someone like you come along try to fix my wrongs and tell me I need help
He be like, "Chill wit' the steel. Let it go and learn to love life."
He's sayin' "B(e) positive", but that's A Negative
It's Thug Life in my blood type
My homie ain't want me comin' out here tho'
Like, "What if you go to rap and he just wants some problems instead."
You know me, who we gettin' ignorant with? I'm on my Indian shit
I'll put Dot on his head
I ain't worried 'bout it goin' ugly
Let him try to be a hoe and punk me
One shot will turn this dick into a pussy like the coach from Jump Street
And after that, if I ain't satisfied yet
I hit him with the butt of my Nina 'til he die now that's an asinine (ass to .9) death
My first battle? 3-0
Looks like I've been handed a re-run
You can't handle the beef, I hope you ain't plannin' to see none
You think I shop at Sam's got big cans, my whole family can eat from
You don't want beef, you got a vegan's heart
But get fly, I'm from where we let the heater's spark
These bullets are bullies, you can get hit just for bein' smart
I know what y'all thinkin', "A white boy with gun bars? Miss me pop."
But like me and my brother Liv', had laws at my mama crib drawin' pistols on her
And I got sit around and listen to you rappers talk about missile launchers
If you met my mama today, you'd probably think she's as square as it gets
But there's a whole different story told through her tears and her sweat
Me, my brother and my dad went to prison for aggravated robbery
All of 'em separate cases
Even though we were gone we kept the bond through the separation
Tried to remain strong and I get lost to the devastation
I just thought I should set the pace since the topic of conversation
You'll probably end up takin' is talkin' 'bout segregation
You don't think I can relate to what it's like to be a minority? Wow
Against most white people that would normally sound more than profound
But when you're white and go to prison, you're the minority now!
Where was my white fuckin' privilege at?
When all I had was my whites and a prison mat and I had to fight just to live with that
Oh he don't like when I'm kickin' facts
See you play like a victim, I was raised by the system
People respect me cause I'm me
The different between the fact and the fiction
You stole Lux whole style and ain't even ask for permission
Just straight jackin', put on that jacket, you trippin'
But I guess we got somethin' in common, see
We were meant to be friends, we both did a robbery and went to the pen (pen')

B. Dot vs Kerry Strickland
Well that's the original man versus...what ever the fuck came after it
I mean y'all dudes got me confused
I'm thinkin', why put the big head scientist versus the 
The dude with no stage presence versus the gift (w)rappin'?
My nigga, this shit's backwards
Look Stricc they mismatched us
Well I'm more Marshall Mathers than this bastard
He Riff Raff'in'
Wanna be black so bad that you're green wit' envy
Kerry (Carrey), it's all over your face, you can't Mask it
Bravo for your last shit
We was all in attendance
Look we all bare witness
What you did at that L.A. Beef event was tremendous
Well dependin', you see it's all about perspective, I mean they was watchin' you
I was scopin' you out, I see shit through different lens
But I get this, you came here for the vengeance
You and Fiji got some friendship
But fuckin' wit' me got ya friend shipped back in a bag with a candle lit vigil for his remembrance
I'm offended
Started the war, what make you think you gon' end it?
Oh the white boy think he street
Well we gon' put him concretely on the gravel in order to cement it
Throw your punches Strickland, I'm just gon' to duck and weave ya
I can't believe y'all got a brother like me versus Justin Bieber wit' a fuckin' Caesar
Had this square buzzin' like a fuckin' beeper
All cause he was cussin' out some other white bitch while she knew it all (Knoeital)
That's wild shit, sound like a bunch of divas
But now you run into that brick wall and anywhere you go I'm blockin' ya
Stoppin' ya, what's ya options bruh?
You beat me? That is somethin' I can not see (Nazi), I got a shot for ya
I'm  cussin' ya, concentrate on ya camp and any one of your mans (Germans) I'm gonna come across well you (Jew) get bent like a swastika
Who's shockin' who?
You scream "Thug life" like you got some 2Pac in ya
Well I guess it's only right I set you up for the five shots from somethin' BIG that's poppin' ya
'Who Shot Ya"?
You fuckin' wit' a Pitbull mixed wit' a boxer
I'll lock ya, look we don't rock wit' Chihuahuas
It's always the smallest dogs in the park, barkin' the loudest 'til the vet' come and operate
It's not a game but that metal make your heart come up out it
You gangsta? I doubt it
Get ya jaw wired and rerouted
I got a big K to put in ya mouth since all I hear is Bigg K comin' out it
Y'all niggas allowed it, but if you ask me he get no respect
You ain't tight cause of what you write
You tight cause you white and you say shit we don't expect
 pull out that race card
But I'd much rather pull out the razor
Ppst, go across your face or stick you
Knock you out where you stand, have you wigglin' ya hands like Andre 3000 in 'Hey Ya'
But due to the fact, quit it with this black act
And all your wack raps 'bout how ya gat clap, you gotta be kiddin'
Another pussy on camera tryin' to fuck wit' all these rapper?
I guess that's how the Kat Stacks
I got a stack of homies that'll clap you homie
I'm mean 3-4 Diesel niggas when they lift the .8 up it ring up back to back to back like Shaq and Kobe
But for you I brought somethin' new
I copped somethin' black like Axel Foley that'll crack ya skully
Get ya blood, plasma and brain fragments on me
I'm bringin' food for thought, like I'm catering a ration party
Look Stricc, don't bore me with the fuck shit
All that, "Oh you sound like Lux shit."
Look the compliment is enormous, but it's really not that important
They even told Kobe he play like Jordan but that ain't stop him for scorin'
You niggas know I'm on it, y'all gon' mourn him in the morning
I know some of you nigga hatin', look I pick up on everything it's just part of my callin'
Against Knoeital, you went all in, that shit was impressive
I just wanna see how these fans react if I give my best Strickland impression
"Aye fam', whatchu know 'bout bein' locked down?
You supposed to be Blood module but they got you in the C section
You on the phone while they phone checkin'
And your baby moms talkin' 'bout an emergency C-section
Warden? Tryin' to get you to snitch. Usin' those tattle tactics
But you keep yo' lip zipped
Cause you can die on that top tier and I ain't talkin' 'bout a battle status."
Prison bars? That's what you got for me Stricc?
I can use the same shit and get that crowd effect, that's rookie shit
You in here wit' a king, it's time to crown the vet'
But before my hands ring 'round ya neck I'll have my mans surround ya set
And we come from under the tees with all angles like "pop pop pop pop" give you that surround sound effect
And you the hypocrite
I don't understand how y'all can jam half the shit that this chick say
Told me not to compare him to Lux but he wanna compare me to Bigg K
When I look at yo' face, I can see the mark within you
You're the opposite of Daylyt, when I look at yo' face I can see the mark within you
Myers punches, outta this world, you gon' think a Martian hit you
You said yo' pen is a problem? Well I'm just here to solve it witchu
You wanna be on that Lux type shit?
Fuck it, let me put on my tux right quick
I ain't tryin' to be condescendin', but how you gang bang and say "Black Lives Matter"? Ain't that contradictin'?
Don't nod in rhythm, I'm talkin', listen
Pay homage pimpin', I'm droppin' wisdom
If Lux taught him anything it should've been to bring that coffin with him
Look, I get it, you're happy beliefs and wanna spread your religion
But you've done nothing to show me I should respect your opinion
I'm forever a cynic, I dug into the depths of your image and found the deficits in it
Who saw Fiji versus B. Dot?
You got some shit to explain
You talkin' 'bout the difference between dicks was just gay
But I'm off that
What about when you told him his  like, "Mr. Osa, what happened?
I thought it was only rappin'
Tell 'em you try to get cute and that Nina's the only bitch that found you attractive."
Whoo
On some white boy shit, that line was awesome dude
But fast forward a bar or two
And you go from rappin' 'bout the Glocks you shoot to preachin' like a prophet do
"Who gonna foster dude if his pops get popped and pops up in a hospital?"
Three bars ago you were the one responsible
Your name suits you well
When you look in the mirror, what do you see Dot?
My point exactly, you don't even know who the fuck you wanna B(e) Dot
Are you a savage or are you meek?
One minute you're the reason people passin' in the street
The next you're an advocate for peace
Want yo' kids to see a world where there don't have to be no beefs
That tough shit is either an act and just a reach or you don't even practice what you preach
You've been passin' as a priest cause the masses been asleep
You've been askin' for a classic, well now you mashed up with a beast
Look at this dude, gangster/preacher
Now I get it, in case that pastor shit don't work out you still gotta have some goals in the meantime
So you just gang bang on the weekdays and save souls in your free time
You preach the right way to these youngsters so they believe that you're never wrong
See you as a leader cause their thinkin' that your head is strong
They look to you for guidance and you fucked them boys, you're Eddie Long
If you think you're savin' anybody from the system, you got shit confused
Your whole perception is misconstrued
You think that you're in alignment and enlightened with the inner you
But really you've been blinded and misguided by the system too
For instance you, think you read books with big words
And tell you only a genius could read it
They have knowledge and bullshit intertwined to help blur the lines so you can't distinguish between it
You're being deceived it just a means to achieve shit
I can't believe you don't see this
They instill racism in us, to make sure we remain the product of the horror
It's not white vs black, it's the rich targetin' the poorer
They steal our identity and rob us of our aura until we're zombies on the corner
Where the only option is movin' forward and becomin' stronger than the former
Cause lookin' back will just make you salty like Sodom and Gomorrah
You got some anger issues
How could one man aspire to inspire so much hatred?
Them white boys angles ain't gon' save you
The crowd gon' get tired of the same shit
This a body, you Ricky Bobby, the only one that think you on fire with that race shit
So that's what you got for me Stricc?
Missin' pastor of how I kill and shoot, that's pretty cute
That's what you got for me Stricc?
A couple lines 'bout how you kill and shoot, you killin' who?
It's another identity crisis
You drove down the wrong road, chose the villain route
A white boy in a room full of blacks? I assure you we a different group
For them nine victims you'll get nine in ya top, have your head smokin'
I'll put chimneys on Dylann Roof
I guess they feelin' you cause this who they chose as a threat
I mean after what I did to Fiji, I would've thought y'all would've thrown me a vet
Instead I get an online battle rapper, now what am I supposed to expect?
I got the advantage servin' him, but he used to goin' back and forth over the 'net
Y'all got this rookie vs a vet? I stay with the iron like I'm black smithing
You'll get ya hat twisted
Three rounds, that's three shots like I'm hat trickin', I'm that vicious
Online you tough as hell, but in real life you act and rap different
I thought you was the great white but on the real you pussy, it's no wonder why you Catfish'ing
Where them niggas that rap wit' him?
I think he need to bring mo' stacks cause I'm checkin' the receipts and I don't think Eloh Stacks
Look I thought you was my mans, now I gotta ask how much you got paid nigga
You was runnin' around sayin' I barely beat Fiji, I cut that brother to pieces
The only thing I edge was my blade nigga
You square but you square, but y'all don't have enough hands for the fade nigga
Y'all got a whole team, I need no assistance
I'm up here makin' Magic with no AIDS nigga, but I figure
Y'all fastened together by that Roman Catholic European fabric
Well I'ma loosen it, ya losin' it man
I mean that council and I see it created yo' savior but it really brought Lucifer in
These devils got y'all thinkin' Jesus is white
How they reducin' his skin, it's like
That white man's religion is one helluva drug, it's a holy hallucinogen
These biblical impostors ain't read they read they hypocophers
That's why I gotta properly pop at 'em
I got a gun that wanna talk to all y'all, it's a chatty ratchet, I gotta tell it, "Quit fuckin' gossipin'."
Bring out the god to them
Fans ask, "What's dude religion?"
I tell 'em, "Well you know my thoughts, they predate that of a Jew or Christian."
I'm lookin' at y'all with the truest vision
But all I see is a bunch of PG's steppin'
A group of niggas dancin', guess I'm not part of this New Edition
My last battle, you was listenin'?
I can't envision you standin' here in this position
Your disposition tellin' me you assistance before you pass away and that's not a metaphor that's euphemism
Glad his crew is wit' him, cause I'm shootin' wit' 'em
Headshot to the nigga that drove you here, let a Uber get him
Once that Ruger split him, it'll make you (U) Haul ass and anybody movin' wit' him
But see it's all  Stricc, they done put you in front of a brother you not lyrically compatible with
I can't battle wit' wits
Look I'm way too professional, not really suited for all that casual shit
I'm shootin' flammable shit that'll damage you Stricc
No question, I'll Tyronn Lue you
I'll shoot then step over ya body that's how  some shit
You drop your pistol, how that sound? I got a mandible grip
You'll die from that first Hollow round, no battle with Clips
This is an amateur script and you the star in it
It's about a white boy that was orphan, born with autism, he was off wit' it
Grew up in the orphanage and watch 8 Mile so long he got lost in it
Started wearin' doo rags, started saggin'
Spell his name with two "C's", blue flaggin'
My man's askin', "Is dude a Crip?"
I said, "I'm not sure if that is true, but the white boy wanna be a nigga and a Crip'll (cripple) beat him 'til he black and blue
I'm attacking you wit' the .9 out to show you what mine 'bout
You said I think I'm Loaded? I figure there's only one way to find out
Point blank range, I blow ya mind for spewin' them rhymes out
You was just here in March, Madness, ya Chris Weber
Your team should've let you know that was ya last time out
But since you back, I'm 'bout to show you what the west 'bout
I'm the next out and the best out
This white boy got soul, brother, right on he better join right in or get left out
Get stretched out, what yo' rep' 'bout?
I'm not talkin' gym class wit' yo' bitch ass when I ask you, "What yo' set 'bout?"
Oh you push weight? Wigger stop
I pull up on your block you better squat
Push up on you with the Glock, one shot make your head shift
Your body drop, hope ya niggas know how the dead lift
Cause you gon' be dead Stricc
That's what you get for lookin' like another decedent of Hitler
Another stereotypical wigger versus a lyrical mixture of words beyond biblical scripture
Oh you hot headed? Well then we heat seekin'
These missiles won't miss ya
The white boy think it's Men In Black got his back
'Til he flash and all them niggas forget ya

He talkin' 'bout 2 "C's", I don't gang bang
But I'm from where they go from pajamas and bad manners
To bandannas and bad grammar
I used to draw pictures and put 'em on the refrigerator
Then I started drawin' pistols and comin' home to dinner later
Look, you had one chance to approach me with the right angle
So that white angle? Really wasn't your smartest decision
You don't think you can learn nothin' from a white boy? You gotta be kiddin'
Oh I get it, you feel you grew up poverty stricken
Me? I was born with that winning lottery ticket
You? Yo' father was missin'
Me? My father went fishin'
No hoe, my father's in prison
What can you learn from a white boy? Shit, A LOT if you listen
I don't wanna hear about the nights that you stress
You've seen movies but got no clue what it's like on the other side of the fence
I remember when the hurricanes hit, man those times were intense
More than a 100 grown ass men and one hoe ass gym with nothing but our pride and respect
Mattresses so close, feel like someone breathin' down the side of your neck
Only four toilets, no room to make a line for who's next
Just to get there, you gotta walk a straight line like a sobriety test
Feelin' like you'll never succeed cause every path has been paved with stipulation
In yo' cell ready to cry, not cause of the shady shit you facin' or yo' crazy situation
Cause the court tryin' to take your bro'
The only person who made you smile or gave you inspiration
Like, "Lord help him with that trial, I'll take the tribulations."
He already been gone nine that's a long time
You worried about tiers in music, I put my tears in music
I can show Jay how to make 'The Song Cry'
You wanna preach and use gun bars, out here lookin' mo' than stupid
But since that's some shit you like, fuck it, let me show you how you supposed to do it
Enough of this cappin' at the captain and then kill the lieutenant
Let's put the gun bars aside and let's be real for a minute
This whole chill life shit is new to me
Nowhere near as wild as I used to be
Yeah after a while of the foolery you just get tired of the eulogy
See I was that white boy wit' a complex
Always felt like I had to prove shit
'Til I finally realized, every time I lose it I lose shit
I mean damn fam', you know it's time to stop with the crook life
When you've been in SEG so long you damn near forgot what you look like
You know how I can tell you ain't real when you rap dude?
You be like, "If I ain't poppin' the .9 and the .40 blow, let it peel and then blast you."
When you should be like Optimus Prime on the Maury Show
And only raise that steel if you have to
Bars I drop should get a mil' and a half views
But I resemble the last dude named Phillip or Matthew
Who's gimmicks and tattoos plus lyrics were taboo and didn't fit in the rap shoe
Now the image attached to, the vision of every critic I pass through
I get it man, that's cool
My whole life been adversity, just more shit to adapt to
I only did this to prove it ain't shit to out rap you
I know the type, get hype for the crowd
Be talkin' strange how you poppin' thangs or the Glock go bang
You catch 'em 1 on 1 they whole persona change
You ain't a problem in the hood, you're a tree fallin' in the woods
I know it sound basic now but let me break it down
You got a lot of bark on cam' for your fam' whenever they around
But if I cut him down to size and no one's there to hear it, he don't make a sound
Look man, if I would've never got locked in prison, I would've made it in the music business
I'm like gettin' socks for Christmas, basically I stupid gifted
I don't joke with bars, even my jokes are bars
For instance, when it comes to bitches, pretty choosey
After Flava Of Love I only wanted the thickest cutie
But you eat the ass like groceries so you can just close your eyes and just pick a groupie
Cause let you tell it, all them hoes got a delicious booty
Look, when his girl first met me, she said I seem like a sorta decent guy
So I dick slapped her across the glasses to show her there's more than meets the eye
She told me he's super gay, won't  a damn dick
Uses the web to find a man quick
She can't count the amount of Peter's she done spied her (Spider) Man with
Enough with the jokes, let me just end on some real shit
You can't be real and racist, that's just not followin' the code
Noe enough real people to discriminate for anything, that's the problem with you tho'
It's the only concept that you've known
Leads me to believe you don't know how it feel to be walkin' on your own
To meet someone real I'd be thrilled, hell I thought I was alone
Where I'm from, it's extra lonely
Cause the best of homies either died or switched sides and gave testimonies
Someone said he was gon' Lux me...I'm nice boy, stop
Tonight went wrong, you picked the wrong white boy Dot
Time

Daylyt made a post on Facebook and this Stan was the first to comment
I mean, to see a man hop on another man dick so quick, it made me sick to my stomach
I had the urge to vomit
You was talkin' nonsense
'Bout how you wanna skip to the top and battle rap him right away
And I gotta say, for somebody to rap about prison so much, you'd think you'd know when you behind bars and could never see the light ('Lyt) of Day
But hey, maybe it's that white privilege that got you feelin' you different
That's why you rap about prison, but I don't think you know shit about it
I mean you out rappin' 'bout prison, I got brothers in prison rappin' 'bout gettin' out it
I see your brain clouded, with that same European thunderstorm that rained on my continent
Put my ancestors through pain, put 'em in chains, make 'em slave but then claimed you abolished it
No reparations, just situations for black athletes to obtain scholarships
Push us through college quick, we get to the league, play a couple of seasons and come right back to where we started
So what make you think you a part of this?
Who gave you some "How to be black" starter kit?
I mean they whitewashed black history, it's only right that I blackout and wash this white boy to re-author it
I put my heart in this
I do this for the single black mothers that put up all of it
Just to post the bail
Look they know they sons did all of it, but shit they not supposed to tell
You a white male in America, that's Heaven, you ain't come close to Hell
You just another comedian
Well dependin' upon your audience determines what kind of jokes you tell
Well, here's where we face the facts
You just another racist cat, it's plain as that
I mean you came in a room full of niggas and figured you could rap about prison cause you'd relate to that
How y'all take that slap?
Right in the face
That's how we got our history took
And don't tell me this ain't about race
You from Texas, the same state that's tryin' to eradicate slave from the history books
I got him visibly shook
This nigga phony as hell, I could tell
You said the Woodchecks checked you
Well I know blacks didn't respect you, I know the Mexicans wouldn't protect you
You must've been lonely as hell in that cell
Lil' Stricc you too frail
Quit it with the jail tales
Tryin' to score points with us cause you was in a box, wigger stop
We get shot by the cops that's very different
I mean the judge won't even let my team push the point across, we can't catch a break
We at the other side of the court cherry pickin'
What you know about that Kerry Strickland?
All my brothers gotta carry (Kerry) Strickland
Not cause we Bloodin' and Crippin', but because we never know when the po-po gonna try to get us buried Strickland
See between us, it's a blaring difference, it's scary Strickland
I mean, you inherited wealth from that slave trade and crop sharing Strickland
But we hold the weight on our shoulders we try not to carry (Kerry) Strickland
That's why I'm comin' out the box wit' twin Cannons, I'ma Mariah Carey (Kerry) Strickland
Yeah he's spittin' about prison
I got brothers doin' 20 plus years for non violent offenses
You prolly got a couple cousins in there convicted of rapin' they sisters doin' a six month sentence
Nigga it's a difference
Let's not act like that cause you rap black that you live a black life
Like you get pulled over, tap tap at the window, flashlight
"All you niggas get out the vehicle
You fit the description of a suspect that committed a murder, last night."
Nah, you don't know what that's like, yo' ass white
Suburbian kids tryin' to be more (B-More) street pushin' Roc(k), but that's light
My niggas dealin' with that heavy shit
Young black males suffer from negligence
And let's not dance around the topic, I mean the Rico Law got they pop locked for some petty shit
Meanwhile, white corporate men evade taxes/embezzlement
They steal money, get caught, go to court but it's still money that settles it
Y'all been doin' this forever, shit from colonization and settlements
They asked me, "Is the white man the devil?"
Well my God, just look at the evidence
Y'all get in an awful rage since y'all climbed up out the caucus caves
Came to the Americas, killed the indigenous people then brought in slaves
Stunt my culture, and gave me that Bible in exchange
How we both prayin' to Jesus? I'm prayin' for change, you preyin' for change
Our gods are not the same
Hold up, that's right Stricc, you not to blame
You just a decedent of the members that done it
Bull shit, if the tenants built the building then why the son of the superintendent still benefit from it?
Stricc you got some cool punches but see, it's a difference with substance
I'm not for that don't shoot, hands up shit, I'm the wrong nigga to fuck wit'
I'm Trayvon, puttin' hands on the Neighborhood Watch
I'm big Mike, in the middle of the street, runnin' through the shots
I'm screamin' "Fuck the cops"
Like a Baltimore teen that don't know how to act
And fuck battle rap, I did this for the slaves that got 3-0'd by the slave masters that can't battle backEmbed
