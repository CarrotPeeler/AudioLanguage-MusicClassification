1 ContributorBarbara Ella LyricsHey Barbara Ella
You're the street seller
I'm gonna bring you down
Upon my choo choo train
In the morning I had a calling
I'm gonna see you again
I'll break you down with a solid reason
Catch on a fire with the more I say
I'll be the one come unfearing
To a love that I found today
That's what I say yea
I've been changing my mind
I've been wasting my time yeah
I've been smoking my load yeah
I've been stuck out on the road road yeah
Your love like a morning sun into my mind
Baby makes me feel so crazy
Hey big fella Mr Watermelon
I got a mind to frown
Upon your wicked ways
Taking money from sister honey
I'm gonna wash you away
I'll break you down with a solid reason
What I know turn a man insane
I'll be the one come unfearing
I'm in love with your Mademoiselle
Hell that's what I say yeah
You might also likeI've been changing my mind
I've been wasting my time yeah
I've been smoking my load
I've been sucking on toads yeah
Your love like a morning sun into my mind
Baby baby
Makes me feel sometimes
I'm going crazyEmbed
