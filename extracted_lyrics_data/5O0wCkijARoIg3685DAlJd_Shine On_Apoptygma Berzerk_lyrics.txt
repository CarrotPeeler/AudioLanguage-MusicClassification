4 ContributorsShine On LyricsIn a garden in the house of love, sitting lonely on a plastic chair
The sun is cruel when he hides away, I need a sister - I'll just stay
A little girl, a little guy - in a little church or in a school
Little Jesus are you watching me, I'm so young - just eighteen
She, she, she, she Shine On
Shine On
Shine On
In a garden in a house of love, there's nothing real just a coat of arms
I'm not the pleasure that I used to be - so young - just eighteen
She, she, she, she Shine On
Shine On
Shine On
I don't know why I dream this way
The sky is purple and things are right every day
I don't know, it's just this world's so far away
But I won't fight, and I won't hate
Well not today
In a garden in the house of love
Sitting lonely on a plastic chair
The sun is cruel when he hides away
