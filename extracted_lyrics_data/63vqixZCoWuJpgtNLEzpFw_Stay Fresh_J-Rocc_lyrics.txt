2 ContributorsFreestylin’ LyricsAlright, now what we gon' do... ha ha ha
What we gon' do right now is we wanna take one more trip back into time, and get into a little solo thing (Yeah), a little cute routine we used to do back in the days. And if, if y'all like that, you know, just jump up, throw money, ladies come to the dress room, whatever you wanna do, show your appreciation. But... (Ah haha, yeah) we started out like this
Number one with the fun
Number two with the cue
Number three, can't you see?
Number four at your door
With a rap so fresh that the rest confess
That to mess with the best, you have to be possessed
So just go, start, proceed, begin
And let the Cold Crush Four tell you something
When no one cared we weren't scared
We came prepared because it be's like that
We did our best and never fessed
And showed the rest we got it just like that
Now we're on top, we love to rock
We love to rock 'cause of the joy it brings (So don't forget what?)
So don't forget, better or yet, we are the best
Because the Four run things
I'll let you know, to be good as the Four
You know you gotta rehearse
So let's start with the last
And then with the first
(A-Kay Gee) I'd like to say that I'm the Kay
So won't you stay so that the All can get down
(Easy A.D.) Well I'm Supreme, know what I mean
Your ladies scream when I'm in your town
(Nigga, nigga, J.D.L.) Call me the L, I rock you well
Girl, at the tel, if you got the time
(Nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, Caz) 
So get off of mine
(On the bass) Chase, with the funky bass (Funky bass)
Guaranteed to keep a smile on your face
He's Charlie Chase (Chase) with the funky bass (Funky bass)
Keeping it rocking at a steady pace
And Tony Tone (Tone), leave the girls alone (Girls alone)
 is on the microphone
Tony Tone, leave the girls alone
 is on the microphone

New York's number one DJ MC
Grandmaster Caz, I'm doing my thing
I write a rhyme, do a dance, and even sing
Now I can play away until the break of day
Put you on hold like a OJ
Or steal a feel to make sure it's real
And if you go and get your brother, I won't peel
Just crash and mash and get cold cash
I smoke hash in a flash but I don't stash
I just dress my best and request my guest
Not to mess with the sess that I possess
Take a toke of the smoke but I won't choke
I'm sniffing coke but being broke to me is a joke
I'm spending Gs, here to please with all the ladies
I got the car and the key for my main squeeze
For a kiss after this, I promise
If you insist I'll put you on my list
I got a crew known to you, before I'm through
I'll introduce all of them to you
Charlie Chase in the place with the bass and grace
Keeping pace in the race, he'll take first place
Tony Tone, not alone, and he has shown
To be known and prone to make the girls his own
J.D.L., rockin' well, and time will tell
If under his bell is where you fell
Without Supreme on the team, it would seem
Like a cup of coffee without the cream
Kay Gee , rough MC
He'll rock in his sleep and very thoroughly
In this crew I fit, admit legit
I couldn't be with a better outfit
One two, one two
You hated, degraded, the L before
Said I wouldn't get nowhere, and 
Now  '79 when you had no time
 was yours but those rhymes you said was mine
'Cause I was the one that went to every party
Until I made myself somebody
While you laid back on your black ass
'Til one, two, three, four, five years passed
So we kept going without even knowing
Now I'm on the top where the wind is blowing
Name like the L, you know 
So how you like me, so how you like me
So how you like me, lick me, bite me, don't trick me
How you like me now?
Alright, here go
Sit down, sucker MCs, don't grit your teeth
And feel the wrath of the Taker, the king of the beat
I'll introduce myself for those who don't know
I'm Supreme Easy A.D., the rappin' pro
I'm your mentor and your 
You all come together when I begin to speak
As I raise the mic like  in my hand
Preside and deliver 
I look down on you brothers, 'cause you can't rate
With the super tough rhymes that I create
I will dominate and keep you on the line
'Cause I was blessed with the gift of saying rhymes
Day after day, year after year
From coast to coast and pier to pier
I'm not just another rapper, I'm a 
One of the chosen few that's here and now
'Cause I'm the prince on the throne, the king of the 
 and the originator
Of the break style, like that y'all
Kay Gee
Alright, alright
I'll be chillin' on my own, sittin' on my throne
Watching new rappers get on the microphone
I might give 'em a clap, or tell 'em they're fresh
I might send them to the East, or send to them to the West
But I won't send them nowhere unless they're fresh
I rule rappers all over the world
Those that got braids and jherri curls
Or whatever their style, they bow down to me
'Cause I'm king of the rap, that's who I be
When I come in the place with my red and white robe
I rock the young plus I rock the old
So don't none of you think that you can be the king
'Cause there's only one king of the hip-hop thing
I rock and rule, make you seem like a fool
If you're tough, you can be now with the chosen few
But if you're not, I'm sorry friend
You might have to start all over again
If you're gonna be down in my domain
 those colors over which I reign
You got to be bad and fresher than fresh
If you bite, that's a plight that will put me to shame
Got to be cool like the jewel on my crown
You got to be a prince 'cause I'm telling you now
My wrath is mighty and if you concur
I might have to put you down with my golden word
I'm the king, I lay down the laws
I give all rappers their duties and chores
The ones that bite, they mop the floors
The ones that are wack, I send them back
The ones that are weak, to them I don't even speak
The ones that are ill, them I have to kill
Only the chosen few that can be the king
Like the Grandmaster Caz, Melle Mel, and Moe Dee
So when you come inside and feel my bass
You know Charlie Chase is in this place
 one time
Hey man, if I'da tripped over that cord, man, I woulda sued ya'll, man
It's-it's-it's all in good performance
Get a little tangled up
Who got the most money out here? If you making the most money out here, throw your left hand up in the air like this. Yeah, yeah, if you making that money, say "Yeah"...Embed
