1 ContributorBorn in Chicago LyricsI was born in Chicago in 19 and 41
I was born in Chicago in 19 and 41
Well, my father told me
"Son, you had better get a gun"
Well, my first friend went down
When I was 17 years old
Well, my first friend went down
When I was 17 years old
Well, there's one thing I can say about that boy
He gotta go
Well, my second friend went down
When I was 21 years of age
Well, my second friend went down
When I was 21 years of age
Well, there's one thing I can say about that boy
He gotta pray
Well, now rules are alright
If there's someone left to play the game
Well, now rules are alright
If there's someone left to play the game
