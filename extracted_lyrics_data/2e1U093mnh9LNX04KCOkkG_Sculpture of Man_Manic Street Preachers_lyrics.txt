War censored, no blood on TV
Cheap entertainment sold like a new deoderant
World War Three, a Sega dreamland
I'd take a whore to the funeral

Sculpture of man
Sculpture of man
Sculpture of man
Sculpture of man

Jesus descends, Dachau his father
Flanders is a corpse under flowers
There's more art in a Burger King
Than the British Museum today

Sculpture of man
Sculpture of man
Sculpture of man
Sculpture of man

Wills and Harry dressed in drag
Standing over the sodomised body of their mother
Would make a beautiful poster in Athena
