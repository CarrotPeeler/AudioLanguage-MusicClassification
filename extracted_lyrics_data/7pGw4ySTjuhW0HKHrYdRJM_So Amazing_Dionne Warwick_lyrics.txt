3 ContributorsSo Amazing LyricsLove has truly been good to me
Not even one sad day
Or minute have I had since you've come my way
I hope you know I'd gladly go
Anywhere you'd take me
It's so amazing to be loved
I'd follow you to the moon in the sky above
Got to tell you how you thrill me
I'm happy as I can be
You have come and it's changed my whole world
Bye-bye sadness, hello mellow
What a wonderful day
It's so amazing to be loved
I'd follow you to the moon in the sky above
And it's so amazing (amazing)
I could stay forever (forever)
Here in love and leave you never (never)
'Cause we've got amazing love
Truly it's so amazing (amazing)
Love brought us together (together)
I will leave you never (never)
I guess we've got amazing love
