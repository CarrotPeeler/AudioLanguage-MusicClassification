2 ContributorsIf This World Lyrics
Nananananana nananana ooo, yeah
Nananananana nananana ooo, yeah

Do you feel you've been disowned
Left outside In the cold
And without a home
Do you think that no one cares
That you're lost and alone
And without a prayer
Don't give in to the lie
That there's no one you can turn to
Don't lose heart there is hope
There is someone who will never desert you

If this world is a lonely place for you
Fall into the arms of love
If this world is a lonely place for you
There's a God that you can trust
He'll comfort you and lift you up

Nananananana nananana ooo, yeah
Nananananana nananana ooo, yeah

Are you looking for a friend
Who will stand by your side till the very end
Someone who is always true to his word
Be assured He won't turn from you
Put your faith in the One
Who will never let you down
He has proven His love
Open up to all He has for you

If this world is a lonely place for you
Fall into the arms of love
If this world is a lonely place for you
There's a God that you can trust
He'll comfort you and lift you up

He hears your cry
He sees your tears
He knows your pain
And all your fears
He waits for you
With open arms
He longs to live inside your heart
You'll never be alone again
If this world is a lonely place for you
Fall into the arms of love
If this world is a lonely place for you
There's a God that you can trust
He'll comfort you and lift you up

Nananananana nananana ooo, yeah
Nananananana nananana ooo, yeah
Nananananana nananana ooo, yeah
Nananananana nananana ooo, yeahEmbed
