4 ContributorsHate Your Friends Lyrics
When you got problems you can't solve
It's enough to make you start to hate your friends
You go to a show and they stare at your face
Don't you know, you hate your friends

When you got problems you can't solve
It's enough to make you start to hate your friends
You go to a show and they stare at your face
Don't you know, you hate your friends

Your face is blushing, your temperature's rising
Drink yourself silly, there's no use disguising
That you hate your friends
Go!

Stare at the newspaper, nothing to say
There's really no use in me going away
I think I'll go to the drugstore today
Maybe that chick's working over there today

When you got problems you can't solve
It's enough to make you start to hate your friends
You go to a show and they stare at your face
Don't you know, you hate your friends
You might also like
When you got problems you can't solve
It's enough to make you hate your friends
You go to a show, they stare at your face
Don't you know, you hate your friends

Your face is blushing and your temperature's rising
Drink yourself silly, there's no use disguising
That you hate your friends
You hate your friends

You hate your friends
You hate your friends
Ha, oh fuck!Embed
