2 ContributorsMe and My Shadow LyricsMe and my shadow
Strolling down the avenue
Me and my shadow
Not a soul to tell my troubles to
And when it's twelve o'clock
We climb the stairs
We never knock
Because there's nobody's there
Just me and my shadow
All alone and feeling blue
Me and my shadow
Not a soul to tell my troubles to
And when it's twelve o'clock
We climb the stairs
We never knock
Because there's nobody's there
And it's me and my shadow
All alone and feeling blue
All alone and feeling blue
All alone and feeling blueYou might also likeEmbed
