1 ContributorUnison LyricsFrom all nations
People gather round
Standing proud
Against the rage
That rips our world apart
Worlds are turning
Times are changing
What defines our freedom
Worlds are turning
Times are changing
What gives us direction
Million voices sing in Unison
"We were never lost."
Expanding souls will live forever
Awaken until our turn has come
Million Voice sing in Unison
"There is no one lost"
From today unto forever
Awaken till the fear is gone
From all nations
People cry out loud
We are the me
We've had enough
We go no further
We want no more
Worlds are shaking
Life are changing
What defines as humans
Worlds are shaking
Life are changing
What makes us worth while
