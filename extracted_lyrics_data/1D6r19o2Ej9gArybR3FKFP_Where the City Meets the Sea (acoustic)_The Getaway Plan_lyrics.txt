1 ContributorWhere the City Meets the Sea (Acoustic) Lyrics
If I've learned anything from this
It would all be gone, it would all be gone
And I will take away your breath
Just to turn me on, yeah, you turn me on
Down where the city meets the sea
I sit, and daylight speaks to me
She carries me away
Oh, yeah

I'll find my way, we'll fall from grace
With the little piece of you that's left in me
But then it's one, two, three, and you're back to me
And all the pieces fit together oh, so perfectly
Enough to takе me home
Just take mе home

If I've learned anything from this
It would all be gone, it would all be gone
And I will take away your breath
Just to turn me on, yeah, you turn me on

We'll find our way, we'll leave this place
With the little piece of me that's left in you
But then it's one, two, three, and you're back to me
And if you hear me loud and clear, then what's the problem, dear?
Why won't you take me home?
You might also like
If I've learned anything from this
It would all be gone, it would all be gone
And I will take away your breath
Just to turn me on, yeah, you turn me on
Down where the city meets the sea
I sit, and daylight speaks to me
She carries me away

Just take me home
Why won't you take me home?

If I've learned anything from this
It would all be gone, it would all be gone
And I will take away your breath
Just to turn me on, yeah, you turn me on
Down where the city meets the sea
I sit, and daylight speaks to me
She carries me away

'Cause down where the city meets the sea
I sit, and daylight speaks to me
And daylight speaks to meEmbed
