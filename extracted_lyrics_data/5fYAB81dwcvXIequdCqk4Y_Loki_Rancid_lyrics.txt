7 ContributorsLoki Lyrics
Set out to mislead, sets out to murder
False appearance is everything to him
Is he good today, or is he evil?
In a violent crime spewing words of madness

It could go either way, you never know
Conditioned to deceive and that's how he likes it
With all the guns going off who could say no to the guy?
Watch out, who's fucking next?

'Cause Loki's playing tricks again
Loki's playing tricks again
Loki's playing tricks again
Loki's playing tricks againYou might also likeEmbed
