We jettin', we jettin', we jettin' uptown
We jettin', we jettin', we jettin' downtown
We jettin', we jettin', we jettin' crosstown
We jettin', we jettin', we jettin', we jettin'
We jettin' uptown (Uptown)
We jettin' downtown (Downtown)
We jettin' crosstown
We jettin' all around
No wonder, no wonder, eighth wonder, eighth wonder is funky

I live Brooklyn like year twenty-four for sure
Sul, C-Know, in my tennis skirt
And the kick hurts so good that I gotta sort of accents for this
Now here's a notion for my nation 'cause I place you on the dynamite
Right? The creamin' is schemin' to get it
Right, the means almighty dollar
The green power, let loose for the hour
I chose the Black Power
Extra fly joint from marker to yellow paper
And you know I don't delay
Together with my honey like silk and soul
We grow and take you back to like afros
And no quittin' or gettin' jumped by the system
It's all day, all play, got verbs and such
And cuts and crew, no blue eyes to emulate
Some straight, but yeah, we straight up
You might also like
Funky
Ease back, the G's is back as an OD, gettin' funky
The sun sets, you bets we gets mad funky
East coast to West, we stays fresh, easy
Smoke rise from the borough where the black cool blow

The globe spins, gems is dropped
No fakin', no bacon, three bridges for money-makin'
Crooklyn, the ebb-swinger's lounge-out spot
Roll with our pants leg up, bump my sounds
Grab my micro', you know how we do in the joint
Do a borough check to see exactly who in the joint
Hot spots, city streets, lye spots, and Jeeps
As a flower, I'm Nile, rivers of style (Fresh, kid)
Yeah, story's complete (Fresh, kid)
Rollin' on them New York streets
With them no-pork beats at the Parliaments
Sevens up, C-know steelo no equal, but the sun and that's

Funky
Ease back, the G's is back as an OD and we funky
The sun sets, you bets we gets mad funky
East coast to West, we stays fresh, I say quickly
Smoke rise from the borough where that black cool blow
It's that nickel slick nig, keep it deep from my heads
Let a fed up, appearin in my camouflage
My hustler walk say New York
Su fronts say Gucci, we make lootchy and never hesitates to set it
Slap hands with my hands from the lands of Crook
Bein lovely over jams that's on the flams with hook
Burn Musk, wear Kush, it's Flatbush
Hear the mental's instrumental cause it's ash to dust
I like to hit lye deep, keep fam tight tight
Keep the vocal strictly any joint, it's right
Let me fly
Ease back, the G's back with the OD
Sun is in the clouds on loud
I got raised by the dim street lights of four cities
My heroes died in prison: George Jackson
Action, she's Buttaflyin, I'm cool eyein
And I rocks no 'Lo unless its scrambler gotten
Me and my honey, we be like Bobby and Erica
Me and my monies, we'll hurt you boulevard empire
One love, gun love come free the land with us
Pigs they cannot shoot this plush and creamy lavishness
Before I pop, I'd rather die in baggy Guess and Timbs
And I put that on the B-K-L-Y-N and that's

Funky
Ease back, the G's is back as an OD, gettin' funky
The sun sets, you bets we gets mad funky
East coast to West, we stays fresh and we do it on the slickly
Smoke rise from the borough where the black cool blow
We jettin', we jettin', we jettin' uptown
We jettin', we jettin', we jettin' downtown
We jettin', we jettin', we jettin' crosstown
We jettin', we jettin', we jettin', we jettin'
No wonder, no wonder, eighth wonder, eighth wonder's
We jettin', we jettin', we jettin' around town
No wonder, no wonder, eighth wonder, eighth wonder's
We jettin', we jettin', we jettin', we jettin'2Embed
