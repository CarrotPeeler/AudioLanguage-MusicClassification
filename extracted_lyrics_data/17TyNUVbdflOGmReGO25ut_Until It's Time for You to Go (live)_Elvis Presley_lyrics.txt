Let's go, let's go, yes, ah, Machete Mixtape, we're gonna eat 'em
(Bem be-be-bem be-be-bem
Bem be-be-bem be-be-bem)

M like war machine, with a kevlar jacket
I'm a prototype, you're protosperm
I smoke lots of weed, I'm flying
Too high, I drop shit, I don't even touch the soil
Always high as fuck, when I was sober
So weird, a kid in an orphanage
Then from the abyss I've had a trеmendous burst
If you diss me, maybe you'rе too high, like Paolo Br-
Rap show, cypher, headshot, sniper
I'm gonna slice you, Wesley Snipes
M is like Elvis Presley, live he
Puts them under the crossbar, like Wsley Sneijder
Bars out of a treasure chest, a curare pen
The snigger, the vicious shot, the Juninho Pernambucano
You idiot, I don't beg the audience, unique flow
I illuminate your girl with Luminol

I'm the death of the new draft picks, I go up on the Seventh Heaven
I smash some fuck-ups, I kill my preys with a Black & Decker
Fake pimp, you hunt down the RapManiacz
For every time you threaten me, I've a canteen full of Jack Daniel's (Baby)
One of this bastards is going to pay me dearly
That's the procedure, he's gonna be slapped like the fascists down in Guadalajara
The exodus of the mad dogs, shut up, Barbie, songs and rhymes
You'll learn, shoot and chew up losers with the Stanislavskij method
Twenty dead bodies and a machetero, I'm in the Mato Grosso
If you touch me, the whole world blows up, I'm the red button
Three people inside my head, I hate them, they made a monster of me
So, that's your problem if there's no fourth place on the podium
If I burn your church down that's because even God annoyed me
That's my demand, I take back what was already mine, but he took from me
There's no king in this scene, so that's gonna be me, all right?
I already have your king's head hanging in my living room
You might also like
Since the first day I spitted my rage on this sheet
Welcome in da hood, rap in the south, leech all around
I've some golden records more but some true friend less
Whoever hoped died, who was waiting for this clear sky
This life gives you no choice: you are born, you live, and you die
Until you fall on the floor
That's why on every New Year Day I make a toast to the new year
Because here every day is the last one available
Machete, you can't compete, King's Supreme is a legend
I smoke a firecracker of weed, and I laugh at your shitty rap
I'm not even 20 and I'm already tired of this environment
You must find wealth in the smile of the people who have nothing
And that's not my fault, don't say I'm a pessimist
Negativity stays in your cradle while you grow up
Another rum, the heart goes BOOM, we're from another planet
You can't catch us anymore, my joy is the salary of my whole crew

Machete Psycho White, check my kit, Michael Knight
You're a loser and you stay home, waiting for the package from Nike
Your girl is hot, she walks with two gigabytes
The truth is that she has a secret compartment, like Samsonite
The flow has no mercy, my dark side
I have the high ground, I'm in between the roof and the Moon
Right in the heart, endorphin, in this thriller, guess
Who's the actor, in the fucking name of God
That's Salmo, always Salmo, repeat: Salmo! (Salmo)
You're crazy if you ask me to calm down
Rap on the pedestal, the balls, rock-hard dick
You're not the man of the year, you've been a man for one year
When this monster gets going, bro, you hear Lord's Prayer
How is it doing on this side? Bruh, all right
Rap is going to do its part, it'll make a rep-ort
When you'll understand my art I'll be already dead
Listen, something has changed
I have no conscience because I don't have a past anymore
Three nights without sleep, and I haven't partied yet
But I should, because your favorite rapper killed himself
There's a gap in the market, they don't know how to fill it
They think rap is like football market, you only work if you are a Buffon or a Pirlo
How come didn't you get it before?
Nicotine, shit that pollutes the city, like the guys in Olgettina
You curse my name when you say it
You have no roots, you're just a puppet, a Mon Cicci
You'd like to hang out with whoever got out from Amici
When you rap you don't kill, you only leave scars
Deep and sad on the face of the monitor
What do you think I care if I don't make modern rap?!
I am true to my crew, this scene doesn't need you
Mine is a group picture, yours is a selfie

*The whole verse is originally in Spanish*
Look how many people eat shit
Forgive me, faggot, you already know who rules
My tongue turns into a machete that cuts your legs
If you remember my crew's name, pull this rope
Just know that my bros don't ever stop me
And if they smash you, they do it proudly, without being sorry
No party, no rumba, I only bring hard bars
I wish bad luck, like a black cat crossing the road
To every idiot that challenges me, I tear off their molars
And I make new jewels, then I keep going
In this battlefield, only the ones who hit last
Idiot, I'm hungry, and I don't go to bed without eating
Tell me, bitch, who's shooting, if you only have fake bullets
Your breath stops
The very first voice, savage
This is Battle Royale, a.k.a. your end, a.k.a. world class flow
Bem be-be-bem be-bem
Bem be-be-bem be-be-
Bem be-be-bem be-be-bem
Bem be-be-bem be-be-

Ok, I'm going, hear the crash, I'll smash you!
Over the feelings, with my verses I'll give you a heart-attack
Hombre, you rap on stage but you lower your head
That's a synesthesia if I strain you with sound
Calm down, since you're not the Messiah, macheteros dinasitias
My verses are like a coup for your tyranny
And you don't like me but, dear me, I got style
Top-scorer, I am like James Rodriguez
Admire, of talent a hotbed
We line you up, flow's a carabine, reload and shoot
Every fan goes crazy and is surprised
New school of thought, you got suspended
Weight, right on your eardrum, you kill it, yes, but no
I'll punch your nose hard, you'll look like Cyrano
Ultimate evil on one track, good story
(En?gma) When I rap, it looks like I opened Pandora's box

My sound breaks in a bank's windows
It bounces inside your Panda, on the street it looks like G-Funk, ah
To my place, of beer, bring six liters
On the beat. with claws, like tigers
The black Metal Slug, rap shooter
If my crew raps, put on your mourning clothes
When you have to give it gas, give it all
Bombs forever and lots of it, everywhere
I've seen you around, your music doesn't sell anymore
You can say around that my crew made you a nice voodoo
On the beat you're challenging the best, Einstein
I'm riding a fighter jet, where are you at?
I sign the third Machete, you reserve the sequel
Send these girls in space on comets
On top of the walls and on the bags there's this name
Until I die in a boat made of banknotes

You suck my dick so hard that I touch your tonsil
Flowzilla, vision is discouraged
She screams, while I open him like a shell
Flow Killa, you come back as mush in a bottle
On my face a nylon sock
Tyrant, titan, I take down those teen idols, I shoot 'em up!
Lyrical hitman
To go against me is a suicide, like walking on the rail (Chico)
This shit is like drug, and you die without it, you stay silent in penance
On top, presidency, call me His Eminence
I've seen your girl, she has her holes open like chakra
She's so cow-ish that she'd be sacred in India
That's bitter, I punch hard on the beat, Sakara
My people shake you like maracas, you disappear like down in Caracas
Rasty Kilo, Hood Star, unfair ending
But you'll get home inside a black bag tonight

You want somebody? Take me
Your tendon will break
With the bags in my gilet
Since I'm 23, hear me out!
Your girlfriend is still a virgin
I rap and the cops blow up like in Sentinel
A thousand rhymes on cakes, like cherries
Machetes, guillotines, they give death to whom oppresses us
You want some shit? I can get you covered in that
Your crew is less frightening than my little nieces
I crush bones, without a red head, you fuck with our shit
Every bar is like a blowjob from Aletta Ocean
We don't stop in the ride for the big slice
Blessing without God, Church without host
I throw up at parties, I get on the list
The barman gets home with the tennis elbow
Look at me well in the monitor recording
While I show you how I don't really give a fuck, man!

No problem, I smash the scene, like a full suitcase
I steal your joint while you're lighting it
I've been writing masterpieces my whole life, I don't write crappy verses
When I get going I make spare ribs out of these rapper
I exterminate those guys, I terminate them
These whores are bitches, I don't deflower them, I take their worms away
Smeezy and los amigos, with drug in silos
In my car I pump up Migos, you pump up DIGOS
No F diesis, 'cause what I wrote is scary
I'm always here, duck, always hemp
Trip Avatar: is the joint, nanana!
I throw punches, adult bars, the kids go: "Gne, gne"
Schizophrenic, because I make pussies squirt
Crazy life, yes, but tomorrow you're gonna die
My cure is keeping money in my hands, manicure
