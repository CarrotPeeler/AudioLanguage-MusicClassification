3 ContributorsNew Skin LyricsI been waitin', still waiting on
Hot sun, you're one and all
I feel every living thing
Can't say I know what you want me to mean
Hot day in the sun
Oooh you're no longer the one
Can you take it to market?
Oh, you'll still be the pawn
It was my idea to save your lovin' soul
I won't answer any more
I won't be your silly boy
Hermetic design, now that they die
There's got to be a way to satisfy the answer
Now that we can sir
I won't answer any more
I won't be your silly boy
I swallowed the snakes (baby baby no!)
And the shedding of my skin. (baby baby no!)
We pull it down now. (baby baby no!)
And the only sound... (baby baby no!)You might also likeEmbed
