7 ContributorsHereâ€™s the Thing LyricsDeep down south, well we play this game
It's them Quad City D.J.'s and you
We call it The Train
So if you wanna ride your thing
Just come on down the train
We gonna rock, ooh, Lord, just jump aboard, baby
So get your next of kin, your sister and your friend
Pack it up now, choo choo, ride on this, choo choo
And, boo, you need to stop faking, and come home with me
I wanna take you home with me, to be alone with me
Woo woo!
Woo woo!
Woo woo!
Come on, ride the train
Hey, ride it, woo woo
Come on, ride the train
Hey, ride it, woo woo
Come on, ride the train
Hey, ride it, woo woo
Come on, ride the train
Hey, ride it, woo woo
Woo woo!
Woo woo!
Woo woo!
Woo woo!

We started out friends
It was cool, but it was all pretend
Yeah, yeah, since you been gone
You're dedicated, you took the time
Wasn't long 'til I called you mine
Yeah, yeah, since you been gone
And all you'd ever hear me say
Is how I picture me with you
That's all you'd ever hear me say
But since you been gone
I can breathe for the first time
I'm so movin' on, yeah yeah
Thanks to you, now I get what I want
Since you been gone
The dance floor silly
The ladies gon feel me
The fellas in the back and they twissin up a philly
Shawty Lo I got flavor
Cuz you know the kid got paper
Like 40 don't sava
Bankhead been pullin capas
The way you drop woulda thought I had a taser
Call me street like the raver?
Shawty Lo, A.T.L, I'm the mayor
Street Nigga but my gear be tailored
Every now and then shawty might rock gators
Me and that kussssh I got acres

But I'd rather get some head
I wish that I had Jessie's girl
But I'd rather get some head

Where can I find a woman like that
I said I love having sex but I'd rather get some head
But I'd rather get some head
But I'd rather get some head

But I'd rather get some head
But I'd rather get some head
