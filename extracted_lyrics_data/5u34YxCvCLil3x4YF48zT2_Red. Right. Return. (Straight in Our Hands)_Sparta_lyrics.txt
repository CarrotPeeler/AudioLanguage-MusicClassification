5 ContributorsRed. Right. Return (Straight In Our Hands) LyricsSails catch any wind that they can
Through any ocean to any land
There's no worries
No worries
Power carries no concern
Silhouetted by the fields as they burn
There's no worries
No worries
You're falling straight into our hands
No compromise, and no demands
You're falling straight into our hands
Into our hands, into our hands
Still water hides an undertow
You can't fight what you can't control
There's no worries
No worries
You're falling straight into our hands
No compromise, and no demands
You're falling straight into our hands
Into our hands, into our hands
You're falling straight into our hands
No compromise, and no demands
You're falling straight into our hands
Into our hands, into our hands

No compromise, and no demands
You're falling straight into our hands
Into our hands, into our hands
Sails catch any wind that they can
Through any ocean to any land
There's no worries
No worriesEmbed
