In the heat of the night
Seems like a cold sweat creeping cross my brow, yeah
In the heat of the night
I'm feeling motherless somehow
Stars with evil eyes stare from the skies
All mean and bright
In the heat of the night

Ain't a woman yet been born
Knows how to make the morning come
It's so hard to keep control
When I could sell my soul
For just a little light
In the heat of the night

In the heat of the night
I've got trouble wall to wall, oh yes I have
I repeat, I repeat in the night
Must be an ending to it all
But hold on, it won't be long
Just you be strong
And it'll be alright
In the heat of the night
In the heat of the nightYou might also likeEmbed
