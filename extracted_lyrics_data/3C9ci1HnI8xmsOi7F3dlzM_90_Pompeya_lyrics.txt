When the love is too low and you want it back
Put the lights on
With rose in a hand, doubt in the heart
Put the lights on
My wheels on a tow when I go alone
Put the lights on
Baby, you should know, without you I'm gone

Put the lights on
This is my home
Place, where I own
Memories of you, dear
Haunting your eyes
Closed in disguise
I'm mesmerized
In memories of you, dear

I saw moon is a human invader
Put the lights on
And it power grew wider
Put the lights on
So we both must be a little wiser
Put the lights on
To doing something to quite her
You might also like
Put the lights on
This is my home
Place, where I own
Memories of you, dear
Haunting your eyes
Closed in disguise
I'm mesmerized
Memories of you, dear


Put the lights on
This is my home
Place, where I own
Memories of you, dear
Haunting your eyes
Closed in disguise
I'm mesmerized
Memories of you, dear

So we're just in here, in the memory
And then smile at me for the memory
'Cause I found the key to the memory
So I hold you tight in the memory
And I'll make you stay in the memory
You will slip away in the memory
So you're just still here in the memory
You will smile to me for the memory
'Cause I found the key to the memory
And you are a guest to the memory
And I'll make you stay in the memory
You will slip away in the memory
You will slip away3Embed
