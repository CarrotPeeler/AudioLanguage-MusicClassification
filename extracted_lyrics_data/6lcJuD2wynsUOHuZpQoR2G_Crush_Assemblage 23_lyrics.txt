2 ContributorsCrush LyricsIn dying light, the day is fading
Defeated eyes regard the sun
That sinks behind the broad horizon
Until the two melt into one
Beneath the gravity of failure
Pinned to the unforgiving earth
Bargains we made with fate unyielding
Proved to be without much worth
Raise your fists and crush eternity
In the name of all the suffering endured
When anger overtakes serenity
Restraint and limitation seem absurd
Outside there blows the wind of conflict
With howling gales that shake the ground
Awakening a quiet vengeance
Belief recovered, courage found
Raise your fists and crush eternity
In the name of all the suffering endured
When anger overtakes serenity
Restraint and limitation seem absurd
The tables turned, the balance shifted
And fragments of the day remain
To light the path in silent witness
To all the fury and the shame
You might also likeRaise your fists and crush eternity
In the name of all the suffering endured
When anger overtakes serenity
Restraint and limitation seem absurdEmbed
