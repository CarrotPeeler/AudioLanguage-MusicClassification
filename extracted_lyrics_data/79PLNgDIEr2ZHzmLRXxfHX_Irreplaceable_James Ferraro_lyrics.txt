Know I'm gonna chase you
I need your love
All the nights you'd tell me
In the night, oh
Don't you try and breathe
You know, oh
After all to me
I'll be better
Those feelings
Both leaving, we're
Dreaming of somewhere
A place we used to share
But we're not there
We're not there anymore
No, no, no
What have I become again
As you cry, chasing me down
Enter me, everything I'll open
The life I built with you
Is crawling under my feet
My little dreams
As you tell to me
I'm missing you
I need your love
You might also likeSomeone's getting onto me
Irreplaceable
The world that I had built
The world that
Is crawling under my feet
Is crawling under my feet
No one told me it's not too late
What's in my mind
It's not, turn around
Listen to me
