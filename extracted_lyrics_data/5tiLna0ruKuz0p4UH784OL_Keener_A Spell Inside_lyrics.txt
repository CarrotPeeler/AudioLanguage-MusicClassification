1 ContributorKeener LyricsBlack sun is rising night is setting
Watch a new day’s within reach
How could this happen the reason’s hard to believe
What is the meaning of those business
Echos of a thousand lies
And deep inside I feel it’s time to release to set free
Perceive the atmosphere is full of plans
But the winds got keener
I try to overcome the system of disguise
Encourage me to leave the bonds behind
As the winds got keener
I try to overcome the system of disguise taking lives
Another morning holy dullness
Members of a big mistake
And time’s so precious but we’re doing without
That money blinds us no clear thinking
Don’t you see this ship is sinking
So try to move I reach you my hand to set free
Perceive the atmosphere is full of plans
But the winds got keener
I try to overcome the system of disguise
You might also likeEncourage me to leave the bonds behind
As the winds got keener
I try to overcome the system of disguise taking lives
And the winds got keener...Embed
