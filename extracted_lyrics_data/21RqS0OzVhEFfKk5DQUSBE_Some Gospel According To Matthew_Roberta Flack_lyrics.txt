3 ContributorsSome Gospel According To Matthew LyricsJust to see
And then you talked
Till I don't know
If you are still trying
It seems we talk and we talk
Till we both end up practically crying
But love comes to Matthews
It's a matter of time
If you seek and you shall find
If you have no faith
And never mind
I'm letting you know how it looks
Towards the end of the line
Which it will come to Matthews
It's a matter of time
Show me the way the reason
Why we can stay and have this ride
I come a long way using freedom to keep me in clime
So take it from Matthews
It's my time
So take it from Matthews
It's my time
I'm letting you know how it looks in the end of the line
So take it from Matthews
It's my time
So take it from Matthews
It's my timeYou might also likeEmbed
