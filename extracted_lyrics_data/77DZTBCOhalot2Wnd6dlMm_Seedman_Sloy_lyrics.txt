2 ContributorsSlow Nights Lyrics
Downtown, meeting you here on a slow night
Driving on a fast lane but we stopped time
God, those eyes make me go, "Ooh yeah" (Go, "Ooh yeah")
"Ooh yeah" (Ooh yeah, ooh-na-na)

Speeding fast, heart gon' blast, put your hands on mine
Make it last, make it last, need you by my side
I know this love, it won't last all night, all night

Baby, when I think of you
Think of all the things we're not supposed to do
Tear me into pieces but I stay with you, stay with you
But I can't take much of this forbidden love


Come 'round and I cry tears like I swear to liquor
Red lights on the streets making my eyes flicker
Onе last night would make me go, , "Ooh yeah" (Go, "Ooh yеah")
"Ooh yeah"

Speeding fast, heart gon' blast, put your hands on mine
Make it last, make it last, need you by my side
I know this love, it won't last all night, all night
You might also like
Baby, when I think of you
Think of all the things we're not supposed to do
Tear me into pieces but I stay with you, stay with you
But I can't take much of this forbidden love


Think of you (Think of you)
Supposed to do (Supposed to do)
Think of you (Think of you)
Supposed to doEmbed
