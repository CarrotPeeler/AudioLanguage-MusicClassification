1 ContributorSail On Sail Away LyricsRise up in the mornin', look out at the world
Brings a smile to my face
There's a south wind blowin', callin' my name
Takin' me to another place
Driftin' along singin' a song
Wonderin' why I never ever cry
There's someone waitin' somewhere for me
Somewhere far across the sea
With hair of gold and eyes that shine so bright
She waits for me in the night
Yes, I will love you
I love you more and more
Baby, don't you leave me
Don't you close the door
Yes, I will love you
I love you more and more babe
Baby, don't you leave me
Don't you close the door
Sail on, sail away
Getting closer day by day
Sail on, sail away, yeah
Oh my love won't you wait, wait for me baby?
'Cause I love you and I always will
Well you know I keep on searchin', searchin' every day
And the more I travel along, seems the more I lose my way
You might also likeThere's a road that's leading from here
Together we can find the light, yeah
So take my hand and I will lead you
Through the dark and lonely night
Sail on, sail away
Getting closer day by day, yeah
Sail on, sail away, alright
Oh my love won't you wait, wait for me baby?
'Cause I love you and I always will
Well you know I keep on searchin', searchin' every day
And the more I travel along, seems the more I lose my way
Oh, yeah
Lose my way
Lose my wayEmbed
