12 ContributorsThen She Didâ€¦ Lyrics
Now her paints are dry
And I looked outside
At the corner boys, yeah
Hey, ho, where did you go?
I don't know
Ha...

Ho-oh, ho-oh, ho-oh
Ho-oh, ho-oh, ho-oh
Ho-oh, ho-oh, ho-oh
Who knows, ho-oh

I went to see your pictures
I spread them across the floor
So this is where they are shown
They're probably saying to you
"If you keep it up, you'll be born"

And you won't ever listen
I'll bet

Burnt drying grass
Scorched by the sun
The buildings remain
You might also like
We will beat them all to dust
I'll bet


Pulled from a headless shell
That blinked on and off "Hotel"
Now the nameless dwell

They hold your key and turn your knob
I'll bet

And will you say hello to my mom?
Will you pay a visit to her?
She was an artist, just as you were
I'd have introduced you to her
She would take me out on Sundays
We'd go laughing through the garbage
She repaired legs like a doctor
On the kitchen chairs we sat on
She was unhappy, just as you were
Unhappy, just as you were
Unhappy, just as you were
Unhappy, just as you were3Embed
