3 ContributorsNight Flight Lyrics
My window looks out onto night and darkness comes
And birds in flight without a sound
Night is strange
My spirit floats out into space on silver wings
And joins the birds without a sound
Night is strange

And I see you there, holding on thin air
With such special care, floating into my life
Peter Pan doesn't know what a special time will show

Nighttime flyings, the star's shining hymns
The space is growing with light all around
Do you feel special nighttime on the great bride of the rise?
Feeling the light comes strange to the beam
Knowing that time is much more than it seems
Hoping my floating will go to the stars
Won't stop my journey to orbiting Mars

My body returns to my room without a sound
And gently glides across the floor
Night is strange
My window looks out onto night and darkness comes
And birds in flight without a sound
Night is strange
You might also like
And I see you there, holding on thin air
With such special care, floating into my life
Peter Pan doesn't know what a special time will showEmbed
