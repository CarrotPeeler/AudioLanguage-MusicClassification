8 ContributorsBad Luck Lyrics
Uh
Woo
Well

You're downhearted and confused
Because lately you've been startin' to lose
Losin' out on everything you might try to do
Bad luck, fella's got a hold on you

Losin' your money, 'bout to lose your home
Done lost your woman and everything you own
Law of average plainly states that chances go around
Now if you wanna know the truth about her
Tell what's pulling you down, yeah

Bad luck (That's what you got, that's what you got), yeah
Bad luck (That's what you got, that's what you got), yeah
Bad luck (That's what you got, that's what you got)
Bad luck, bad luck

You played that number 'cause that number's hot
'Stead the bookies get you for every cent you've got
Walk around in a daze with your pockets bare
Go see your woman, and she ain't even there
You might also like
Losing your wisdom and all your track of time
The more I think about it, I think you're 'bout to lose your mind
Some people call it jinx, some say, "It ain't my day"
Now if you wanna know the truth about her
Tell what's pulling you down, yeah

Bad luck (That's what you got, that's what you got)
Bad luck (That's what you got, that's what you got)
Bad luck (That's what you got, that's what you got)
You got bad luck, bad luck
Bad, bad, bad, bad, say you got bad luck

Don't go away
Woo, huh, huh
One more thing

Law of average plainly states that chances go around
But if you wanna know the truth about her
Tell what's pulling you down, yeah
Down, down, down, down

Bad luck (That's what you got, that's what you got)
Bad luck (That's what you got, that's what you got)
Bad luck (That's what you got, that's what you got)
You got bad luck, bad luck, bad luck
Bad, bad, bad, bad, bad
Bad luck (That's what you got, that's what you got)
Bad luck (That's what you got, that's what you got)
Bad luck (That's what you got, that's what you got)
Said bad luck, bad luck, bad luck
I can't get away from here
Bad luck (That's what you got, that's what you got)
Bad luck (That's what you got, that's what you got)
Bad luck (That's what you got, that's what you got)Embed
