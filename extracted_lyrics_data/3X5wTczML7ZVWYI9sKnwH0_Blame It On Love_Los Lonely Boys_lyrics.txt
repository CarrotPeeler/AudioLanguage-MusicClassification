1 ContributorBlame It on Love LyricsThe guys say it's a crime
Daddy sold that '69
'Cause he changes his whole world
For someone's daddy's little girl
Blame it on love
Blame it on love
Blame it on love
Her girlfriends say sometimes
That she lost her mind
'Cause she gave up her dreams
All for the diamond ring
Blame it on love
Blame it on love
Blame it on love
Ya know she blamed it on love
She blamed it on love
It can make you high
Or bring you down
Or make you laugh and cry
It can turn your whole life upside down
If you need a reason why

Blame it on love
Blame it on love
All through history
It's always been a mystery
I don't know too much
But I know it comes from up above
Now I have read my mynd
Tryin' to search and find
And oh I still believe
That you were sent for me
It can make you high
Or bring you down
Or make you laugh and cry
It can turn your whole life upside down
If you need a reason why
Blame it on love
Blame it on love
Blame it on love
Blame it on love
Blame it on love
Blame it on love
Blame it on love
Blame it on love
Blame it on love
Blame it on loveEmbed
