13 ContributorsNever Say Never Lyrics
If time itself was his demeanor
There'd be no sunlight or a glimmer of sunlight
Landing on the street
Sunsuit girls must be discreet
Sunsuit girls must be discreet
Nursing their fathers, locked inside
They masqueraded as his bride

I might like you better if we slept together
I might like you better if we slept together
I might like you better if we slept together
But there's something in your eyes that says maybe
That's never, never say never

Slumped by the courthouse with windburn skin
That man could give a fuck about the grin on your face
As you walk by, randy as a goat
He's sleeping on papers but he'd be warm in your coat

I might like you better if we slept together
I might like you better if we slept together
I might like you better if we slept together
But there's something in your eyes that says maybe
That's never, never say never
You might also like
There's no easy way to lose your sight
On the street, on the stairs
Who's on your flight?
Old couple walks by as ugly as sin
But he's got her, she's got him

I might like you better if we slept together
I might like you better if we slept together
I might like you better if we slept together
But there's something in your eyes that says maybe
That's never, never say never

I might like you better if we slept together
I might like you better if we slept together
I might like you better if we slept together1Embed
