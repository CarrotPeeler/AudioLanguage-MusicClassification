Our love is drifting
Baby, I can see it day by day
Our love is drifting
Baby, I can see it day by day
I know you don't care now, little baby
But I let you have your way

If you leave, my baby
You know the pain won't last too long
If you leave, my baby
You know the pain won't last too long
It's not the first time, little girl
Your old man been messed around


I love you, baby
You know I tell the whole world I do
Yes, I love you, baby
I'll tell the whole wide world I do
You know there ain't nothing, ain't nothing little girl
Yes, that I wouldn't do for you
You might also like
Yes, I worked hard all my life, baby
I gave you everything I had
Yeah, I worked hard all my life
Baby, I gave you everything I had
It's too late, it's too late now, baby
You know our good love's gone bad1Embed
