2 Contributors30 For 30 Lyrics
Can feel how you want, I just think that I'm better
I'm speakin' my truth, now I stream like a river
Do you want it? I had it, you need it, I got it
I see it, then grab it, same day that I shot it
Back when I was fucked up, had to fill up my pockets
'Bout money, 'bout methods, I follow the topic
Put trust in myself 'cause I know that y'all hurt me
I heard what they sayin', it doesn't deter me
My heir'll be great when I hang up the jersey
Drop on a Tuesday, it click on a Thursday
Ball like I'm tryna do 30 for 30
Get drop on an opp and it came from a birdie

Kicked out my house, I was stayin' over Rick's
Fell asleep with the stick, woke up and hit a lick
'Membеr tryna sell weed, but this shit really play-play
Tryna find another way 'causе I want a big payday
Money come fast when you playin' with the white bitch
Keep real right, dawg, 'cause the junkies really like this
Had to shoot my dawg, same finger that I type with
Lil Gray real cold, might stab him with an icepick
I ain't got much, might settle for a loft
Why you niggas switch up? Man, you got me at a loss
A nigga  still get it, had to cost
Say when it came down to it, gave the game my all
Been through a lot shit, why I shoot him while smilin'
Nigga really tryna win, so I'm comin' out foulin'
All my money full-grown, what you talkin' 'bout, childish?
I just need the cash fast, either cars or the powder
You ain't had guidance, you need it already
Got rid of my plug 'cause his prices was petty
They whip out they wallet, they hand me the debit
Keep squeezin' the trigger, you squeezin' a teddy
Go, I might spin on this shit when they ready
Poor, my name Joe and I work at a deli
Fuckin' with Danny, might pizza 
My methods uncanny, I see that you jelly
They had agendas, but never would tell me
Give chance after chance, and again, they'll fail me
I'm a real nigga, fake shit, I can't mix with
And you a full-blown flunky, I'ma get all the get-withs
I could dance on the work, Chris Brown how the kiss-kiss
Remember me and Lil Yo stole whip for a quick trip
Had to let her go to work 'cause business is business
And I love to shot first, and I'm killin' the witness
You might also like
Can feel how you want, I just think that I'm better
I'm speakin' my truth, now I stream like a river
Do you want it? I had it, you need it, I got it
I see it, then grab it, same day that I shot it
Back when I was fucked up, had to fill up my pockets
'Bout money, 'bout methods, I follow the topic
Put trust in myself 'cause I know that y'all hurt me
I heard what they sayin', it doesn't deter me

My heir'll be great when I hang up the jersey
Ball like I'm tryna do 30 for 30
Drop on a Tuesday, it click on a Thursday
Get drop on an opp and it came from a birdie

I'ma move with the mission, you movin' suspicious
I'm pullin' the pistol, the 
I'm fuckin' my vixen, you end up a victim
The game is not on me, this shit in my system
Think on it twice 'fore you come at me crazy
You think you a man, but you act like a lady
Jody still bummin', keep comin' with twenty
He was just once my man, but I still take his money
I got my man with the engine still runnin'
Put dough in my hands, all my fingers could thumb it
Brody just  shit all for nothin'
 fifteen, let 'em know that we comin'
Some niggas, they thuggin', some niggas, they love it
But if they wanna play, then I'm makin' a bucket
Patiently waitin' for a way out the gutter
Tryna bust the right play, give a plate to my motherEmbed
