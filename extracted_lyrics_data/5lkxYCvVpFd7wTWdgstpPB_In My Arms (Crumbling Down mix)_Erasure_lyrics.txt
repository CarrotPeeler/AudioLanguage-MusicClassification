1 ContributorCantbeatthecomputers Lyrics(JOHN RAINO)
Fake it still
Made of steel when i’m eighty
Paris at night
Pussy wet on pavement
Still locked in my prison
And I don’t get near them
Create a film in the mirror
If I could look further I wouldn’t
That’s just the way I do
Shoot with gratitude
Who the fuck are you ?
Fuck the hole make it move
Fuck imma do that
Me and my girl back
I ate a food made by my mind
Alright you high
We the riches with our own sight
I might
Be the one you see in the dark times
White line
Alined
See the red whine
Satan ain’t it
Cigaret on the porch i’ll be aiming
You behaving like you hate it
Is it me faded ?
You might also likeThere’s life on my island
Cardiac problems hash solved’em
Crack the crackers on my bed tosse’m
Happens often
Girls attached lock’em
Again, toss’em
Fuck !
Eat candy
Made me happy, still am
I don’t transport a system
And I can’t beat the computers
But I can bite the future
Can’t seem to feel my nature
You seem to be restraining
And now your chain is flipping
Actin’ weird, lies are itching
Whatever find your vision
My eyes won’t say none
You can’t apply your potion
Notion of illusion
The motion when we love is the key
To our cage indeed
We mix the brains
And one mistake makes waves
Crumbling pace
We stable like the same old bridge on which the wind help us skate
Make us weight nothing
Bitch
Bad sign, red eye
You read that
No one is sure how can I
Be, You
I can not see through the vision I bleed
Cause in seconds I feel weak
But just a moment ago I killed shit
And dismissed frozen cindarella
Seen the real ones
Snorted some pills
Fun seeking in a garden where no one be
Because it’s rare that someone beat the He
And I jump on bitches
And their laugh make me anxious
Stay with my princess
Make shit
Smoke stress
No paycheck
Sex when she undresses
This is some love without a curse
Rehearsed to work
And I dare to be there, to be there
(ALIOCHA)
That shit’s beyond me
I forge my own reality
This is crazy
You can’t touch me
I bread my own supplies
I won’t apply to this world’s madness
I don’t need your idols
When the shit flips i’ll be covered
I won’t be bothered
Hide my face when i confront their eyes
They seem to taste the color of my mind
I stole their chair
Now they’re pissed
They have to stand
Up
Fuck
For a second I believed time stopped
The earth crushed with a parallel
One
Can’t remember when it began
I see a face in my arms
Sometimes i freak the fuck out
A bitch ready to choke mine
They should erase the hatred in their minds
I feel a strange vibe these days be shifting my head upside down3Embed
