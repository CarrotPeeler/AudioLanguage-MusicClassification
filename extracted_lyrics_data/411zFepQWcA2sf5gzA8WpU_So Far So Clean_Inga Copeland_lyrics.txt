2 ContributorsSo Far So Clean Lyrics
It’s like a quiet day that’s made for just us two
You take your mind away  what it can do to you
You make me strong but make me weak
I won’t be there always
It’s not my style to be there for real

It’s like a quiet day that’s only there for us two
I take my mind in places that I can’t go with you
You make me strong but make me weak
I will try for it always
Not our style to be there for real

On and on and on and on and on
I find it hard to find the means to carry on
I  the better of my time for you
You make it hard, you make it easy, yеah figure it out
You turn it back, turn it forward and you turn it around
I find it hard to find the means to carry on
You makе it hard, you make it easy, yeah figure it out
You turn it front, turn it back and you turn it around

It’s like a quiet day that’s made for just us two
You take your mind away  what it can do to you
You make me strong but make me weak
I won’t be there always
It’s not my style to be there for real
You might also like
On and on and on and on
I find it hard to find the means to carry on
I  the better of my time for you
You make it hard, you make it easy, yeah figure it out
You turn it back, turn it forward and you turn it around
I find it hard to find the means to carry on
You make it hard, you make it easy, yeah figure it out
You turn it front, turn it back and you turn it around
On and on and on and onEmbed
