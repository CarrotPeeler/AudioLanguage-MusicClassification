1 ContributorMÃ©tropolitain LyricsO come, O come, Emmanuel
And ransom captive Israel
That mourns in lonely exile here
Until the Son of God appears
Rejoice, rejoice
Emmanuel shall come to thee, O Israel
O come, O come, Thou Dayspring bright
Pour on our souls Thy healing light
Dispel the long night's lingering gloom
And pierce the shadows of the tomb
Rejoice, rejoice
Emmanuel shall come to thee, O Israel
Shall come to thee, O Israel
O come, desire of nations bind
In one the hearts of all mankind
Bid every strife and quarrels cease
And fill the world with Heaven's peace
Rejoice, rejoice
Emmanuel shall come to thee
Rejoice, rejoice
Emmanuel shall come to thee
O IsraelYou might also likeEmbed
