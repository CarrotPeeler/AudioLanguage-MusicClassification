12 ContributorsSweet Talk Lyrics
Oh, baby, when you're next to me
I feel like I'm in ecstasy (Uh-uh)
Oh, baby, when you look my way
I hear the things you want to say (Uh-uh)

And when your body moves close to mine
I get the rush I can't describe
When you get my heart beating like
Oh, baby, oh, baby
You should know how to read my mind
Telling you it's about that time
And nothing could be better

I want your sweet talk
Talking to me all night
Filling me with love
What's love without your sweet talk?
Keep it going, don't stop
Till we turn the lights back on
Baby, I want you to sweet talk to me
Sweet talk to me, sweet talk to me
The sweetness on your lips
I need a taste of it
You might also like
Don't need nothing to fly
Your sugar always gets me so high (Uh-uh)
Hotter than a fantasy
I'm living out in my wildest dreams (Yeah-eh)

And when your fingers touch my neck
I start to lose my breath
And when you kiss me just like that
Oh, baby, my baby
'Cause you know how to read my mind
Telling you it's about that time
And nothing could be better

I want your sweet talk
Talking to me all night
Filling me with love
What's love without your sweet talk?
Keep it going, don't stop
Till we turn the lights back on
Baby, I want you to sweet talk to me (Keep talking)
Sweet talk to me (Oh, baby), sweet talk to me (Ooh)
The sweetness on your lips
I need a taste of it
Ye-ye-yeah
Sweet, yeah-yeah
Talk to me, talk to me
Talk to me, ooh

I want your sweet talk
Talking to me all night
Filling me with love
What's love without your sweet talk?
Keep it going, don't stop
Till we turn the lights back on
Baby, I want you to sweet talk to me
Sweet talk to me, sweet talk to me (Ye-ye-yeah)
The sweetness on your lips
I need a taste of it

Sweet talk to me (Talk to me)
Sweet talk to me (Talk to me)
Sweet talk to me (Ye-ye-yeah)
The sweetness on your lips
I need a taste of it1Embed
