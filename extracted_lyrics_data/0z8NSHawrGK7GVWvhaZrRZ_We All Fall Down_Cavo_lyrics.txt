2 ContributorsWe All Fall Down Lyrics
Everything is random
Everyone is fake
Everything we build will just disintegrate
No one will remember when anybody cared
If everything around us just disappeared

But don't let them change your mind
I'm trying to save you now
We all fall down
When it's over now
We won't be broken now
We all fall down

You said you'd never leave me
It's like you never did
Moments that we wasted turned into years
Take a look around you
Nothing's ever fair
Reasons that they change you turned into fear

But don't let them change your mind
I'm trying to save you now
We all fall down
When it's over now
We won't be broken now
We all fall down
You might also like
In need of a change
In need of the light
The moment was wrong
And no one was right
And I know that some day
You'll turn your back to me
I know that some day
You won't be there for me

I'm trying to save you now
We all fall down
When it's over now
We won't be broken now
We all fall down
We all fall down

We all fallEmbed
