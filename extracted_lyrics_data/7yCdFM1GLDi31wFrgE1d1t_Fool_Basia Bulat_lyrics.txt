5 ContributorsFool Lyrics
Find me when our house is empty
I'm already in my new town
From here, I can hear you laughing
I know the sound very well

I'm still your fool, I'm still your fool
I'm still your fool, I'm still your fool

Tried to find a way to show you
Told the story to our friends
Now that we all know the punchline
Can I make you understand

That I'm still your fool, I'm still your fool
I'm still your fool, I'm still your fool

I'm always first to break
Friendly or foolish, you tell me
No surprises, please
Only our echo following
Tried to find a way to show you
I can't pin you down again
Now that we all know the punchline
Only you know if I am

Am I still your fool? I'm still your fool
I'm still your fool, I'm still yourrr...
