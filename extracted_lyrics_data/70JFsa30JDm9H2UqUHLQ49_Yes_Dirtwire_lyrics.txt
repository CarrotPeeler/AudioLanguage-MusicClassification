Yeah, Kid Vishis, M-I-C
(Uh oh) You did, yeah, yeah

Pick 'em apart
Vicious 'cause I spit from the heart
Vish is the shit, and I was it from the start
No talk, listen as I present my ignorant art
Vishis paint the picture so good, that you can see in the dark
No horn, no trumpet, still blues don't come
Like we're pickin' up your phone and dialin' 9-1-1 (Hello)
I send a shot and drop all your dues
When I'm poppin', got more bullets than Jordan got shoes (Yeah)
Hit that boy, make him daze
Keep swingin' 'til the stage smell like 
Ugly, grudge me never, get yo' cheddar
Put some money up, I tell ya I'm tearin' up whoever
Used to see him fire like a chain smoker
You MC's rap like your brain's broken
I know you were lame, just hopin' the game opens up
Wide enough to fit your bullshit, still ain't tight enough

(Yeah, yeah) Blow 9's, go so calm, show far 
Mess with him like he's so high 
 homie  knows
I kick at your style, kickin' my  flow
Flow, I click the hammer you dead
If you a amateur cameraman, get your camera prepared
'Cause I'm a animal, yeah
'Cause the bullets I'm pullin' is big and hollow
I call 'em 
Me and Vish, yes, me and Spliff, yes
We dirtier than a little easy piss test
If you like your night,  you get your shit checked
 you look like my shit wet
I only fuck with the radar, when I come to Copenhagen
I just say we straight, my homie raved and 
The only one around here  and bathing 
Hot rappers is what I eat, I gotta caging taste

Goddammit, warning
My fire will burn you
Goddammit, warning
 caution
For real
Y'all know me 
Place to be
Walk with me
I'll make you move
Walk with me
I'll make you move
Walk with me
I play I stay, I don't goin' for 

Catch me on yo block, middle finger's up, walkin' through (What up)
Lookin' at your crew like ya don't know who you talking to
Wack rap handle that
Handicapped 
 your career ain't something I find hard to do (Uh uh)
I mean business and anybody can get it
The way we put it down 'round here - sky's the limit
I'm 'live and
Son I'm so nice with it
I'm playin' with chickens, thinkin' how I'm layin' it different
Four finger
Y'all gotta admit it (Yeah)
What's 
Stop fucking with it 
'Til they stickin' and moving, y'all stick to the movement
Got a mean team machine kit 
J-Spliff, Substance, Vishis, and Royce
Fuck with it, we ain't give 'em a choice (No)
The cream of the crowd
Yup, believe it or not
These people is schemin' and screaming, yo, is he gonna flop?
No, never ever, 
And I ain't leavin' the scene until I'm reachin' the top
I'm so versatile, I verse your style
Kick you off your own stage show 'em merk your crowd
Chump at the service now
Worth your while
Fools imma damage your dudes
Niki's playin'
That's
M-I-C
