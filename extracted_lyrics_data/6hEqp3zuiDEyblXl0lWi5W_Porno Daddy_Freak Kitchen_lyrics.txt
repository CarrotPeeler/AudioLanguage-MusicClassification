Well done, dad
He fucks for a living, calls it acting
And says it's the best damn job he ever had
Porno Daddy
They call him Porno Daddy
And I am the invisible kid
What about you son?
Do you give a damn?
What about your daughter?
Do you give a damn?
Daddy-o...
This is the last time
What about you son?
Do you give a damn?
What about your daughter?
Do you give a damn?
Daddy-o...
This is the last time
They tell me at school, Dad's far beyond cool
Well, his "hip factor" doesn't do shit for me
I am 14 years old, I have seen it all
Just another fat chunk of anxiety
You might also likePorno Daddy
They call him Porno Daddy
And I am the invisible kid
What about you son?
Do you give a damn?
What about your daughter?
Do you give a damn?
Daddy-o...
This is the last time
What about you son?
Do you give a damn?
What about your daughter?
Do you give a damn?
Daddy-o...
This is the last time
This is the last time
My sister floats around in a pool of sedatives
We never speak about the way Dad lives
(Guitar Solo)
What about you son?
What about your daughter?
Daddy-o...
This is the last time
What about it?
What about your daughter?
Daddy-o...
This is the last time
What about you son?
Do you give a damn?
What about your daughter?
Do you give a damn?
Daddy-o...
This is the last time
What about you son?
And do you give a damn?
What about your daughter?
What about your daughter?
Daddy-o...
This is the last time
This is the last time
This is the last time
Porno Daddy
They call him Porno DaddyEmbed
