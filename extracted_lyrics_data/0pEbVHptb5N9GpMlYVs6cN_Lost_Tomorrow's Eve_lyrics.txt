Drying up conflict
Sanity and insanity
Blue heat, black heart
Instinct and intellect
I want the freedom of calm
I want the freedom of calm
Desire speaks to you without compassion
Pursuing it blindly
A dead past that never returned
I want the freedom of calm
An infinite storm of nothingness

The sky above the clouds
A rainbow that fate has devoured
I gave up hope
But I'm not going to be lost tomorrow, even if it is hell
I'm gonna crawl

Slash the tranquility
Slay the fate of mine
The curse is not real
It's all in my mind
Same old, same old
Bring it on, Bring it on down
Live on
Same old, same old
Bring it on, Bring it on down
Livе on
Drying up conflict
Sanity and insanity
Blue heat, black heart
Instinct and intеllect
I want the freedom of calm
I want the freedom of calm
You might also like
The sky above the clouds
A rainbow that fate has devoured
I gave up hope
But I'm not going to be lost tomorrow, even if it is hell
I'm gonna crawl

Fight
The sky above the clouds
A rainbow that fate has devoured
I'm gonna crawl
I want the freedom of calm
I want the freedom of calm
I want the freedom of calm
An infinite storm of nothingness

The sky above the clouds
A rainbow that fate has devoured
I gave up hope
But I'm not going to be lost tomorrow, even if it is hell
I'm gonna crawl

I want the freedom of calm (I want the freedom of calm)
I want the freedom of calm (I want the)
Hold that faith that is made of steel1Embed
