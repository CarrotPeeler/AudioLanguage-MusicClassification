5 ContributorsBald Headed Woman Lyrics
Well I don't want no bald headed woman
Gonna make me mean, yes, love, it make me mean
I don't want no bald headed woman
Gonna make me mean, yes, love, it make me mean

I don't want no sugar in my coffee
Gonna make me mean, yes, love, it make me mean
I don't want no sugar in my coffee
Gonna make me mean, oh, make me mean

Well I've been driving on bald headed mountain
I've done my time, I've done my time
I've been driving on a bald headed mountain
I've done my time, oh, I've done my time
I've done my time, done my time
I've done my time, done now
Oh


Well I, I don't want no sugar in my coffee
Gonna make me mean, make me mean
Whoa I don't want no sugar in my coffee
A-make me mean, a-make me, gonna make me mean now
