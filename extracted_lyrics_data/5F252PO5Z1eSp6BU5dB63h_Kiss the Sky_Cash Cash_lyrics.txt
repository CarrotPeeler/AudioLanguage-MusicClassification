We could fly
Til we die
So high that we could kiss the sky
You & I
We could fly
So high that we could kiss the sky
So high that we could kiss the sky!
You & I
We could fly
So high that we could kiss the sky!
Get greasy!
You & I
You & I
We're all looking for it
We're all fighting for it
Just enough to keep us up all night
We're all looking for it
We're all fighting for it
Just enough to make us feel alright
You & I
We could fly
Til we die
So high that we could kiss the sky
You & I
We could fly
So high that we could kiss the sky
You & I
We could fly
Til we die
So high that we could kiss the sky
You & I
We could fly
So high that we could kiss the sky
So high that we could kiss the skySee Cash Cash LiveGet tickets as low as $48You might also likeEmbed
