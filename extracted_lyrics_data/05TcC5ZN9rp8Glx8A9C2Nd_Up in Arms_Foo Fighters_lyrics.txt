19 ContributorsUp in Arms Lyrics
The rain is here, and you, my dear
Are still my friend
It's true, the two of us
Are back as one again

Well, I was the one who left you
Always comin' back, I cannot forget you, girl
Now I am up in arms again

The rain is here and you, my dear, are still my friend
It's true, the two of us are back as one again

Well, I was the one who left you
Always comin' back, I cannot forget you, girl
Now I am up in arms again

Together now, I don't know how this love could end
My lonely heart, it falls apart for you to mend

Well, I was the one who left you
Always comin' back, I cannot forget you, girl
Now I am up in arms again
You might also like

Well, I was the one who left you
Always comin' back, I cannot forget you, girl
Now I am up in arms again

Well, I was the one who left you
Always comin' back, I cannot forget you, Gil
Now I am up in arms again3Embed
