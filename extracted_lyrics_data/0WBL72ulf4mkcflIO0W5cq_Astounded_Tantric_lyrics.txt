Hey, hey
You don't care
How I feel
You care about yourself
I understand the way you feel
Your pity is your wealth
Lost in time
She don't mind the change in the ways
Now you're mine
We don't mind the change in the ways
Chorus:
Hey hey hey
I just found my way
All you stupid fuckers
Walk around astounded and grounded
Hey hey hey
I just found my way
Some things can be lost
But now I found a new way
Through it again
You might also likeI'll never wish you harm in life
I pray you find your way
I have found I'll live my life
Discovering my fate
Lost in time
She don't mind the change in the ways
Now you're mine
We don't mind the change in the ways
Chorus (3x)
A new way
Through it
A new way
Through it
AgainEmbed
