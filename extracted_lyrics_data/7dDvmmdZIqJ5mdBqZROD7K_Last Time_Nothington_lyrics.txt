3 ContributorsLast Time LyricsWaiting for the sun
Another day of recess
Another day for regrets
Looking for the answers
Searching for a reason
Something to believe in
Tell me the last time you didn't regret your first line (?)
Show me a way out so I can get off __
Bleeding out
There's no confidence
There's no time for this
What it comes down on; there's no place for thisYou might also likeEmbed
