Happens all the time
It's gonna happen, happen, till you change your mind
It's gonna happen, happen, happens all the time
It's gonna happen, happen, till you change your mind

The best story I've ever heard
The truth about fat Mr. X and the young girl
See how far he'll let you go
Before he persuades you, when you're walking home

Happens all the time
It's gonna happen, happen, till you change your mind
It's gonna happen, happen, happens all the time
It's gonna happen, happen, till you change your mind

Watching your friends passing by
Going to sleep without blinking their blue eyes
Too slow to notice what's wrong
Two faced to you, when you're taking them on

Happens all the time
It's gonna happen, happen, till you change your mind
It's gonna happen, happen, happens all the time
It's gonna happen, happen, till you change your mind

Everything goes when you're dead
Everything empties from what was in your head
No point in waiting today
Stupid revenge is what's making you stay

Happens all the time
It's gonna happen, happen, till you change your mind
It's gonna happen, happen, happens all the time
It's gonna happen, happen, till you change your mindEmbed
