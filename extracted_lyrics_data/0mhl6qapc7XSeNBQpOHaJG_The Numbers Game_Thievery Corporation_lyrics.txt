3 ContributorsThe Numbers Game LyricsI'm talking people about the same old game
Their running them numbers and the winners never change
The dice is loaded, the deck is stacked
The game itself will hold you back
Check out your mind and don't be blind
To the numbers game
What I say
Don't be in the dark all by yourself
Don't play the hand that the dealer has dealt
We're cashing out 'cause it's time to sell
Taking back the power, gonna share that wealth
Come on now
Check out your mind and don't be blind
To the numbers game
What I say
I'm talking people about respect
Baby you can't win when you place that bet, come on now
The dice is loaded, the deck is stacked
The game itself will surely hold you back
Check out your mind and don't be blind
To the numbers game
Check out your mind and don't be blind
To the numbers game
