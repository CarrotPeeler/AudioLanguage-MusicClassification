6 ContributorsYou Light Up My Life Lyrics
So many nights I sit by my window
Waiting for someone to sing me his song
So many dreams I kept deep inside me
Alone in the dark but now
You've come along

And you light up my life
You give me hope
To carry on
You light up my days
And fill my nights with song

Rolling at sea, adrift on the water
Could it be finally I'm turning for home?
Finally, a chance to say hey
I love you
Never again to be all alone

Because you
You light up my life
You give me hope
To carry on
You light up my days
And fill my nights with song
You might also like
And you
You light up my life
You give me hope
To carry on
You light up my days
And fill my nights with song
With song
You give me hope
To carry on
You light up my days
And fill my nights with song

It can't be wrong
When it feels so right
Because you
You light up my life, my life, my life, my life ooohEmbed
