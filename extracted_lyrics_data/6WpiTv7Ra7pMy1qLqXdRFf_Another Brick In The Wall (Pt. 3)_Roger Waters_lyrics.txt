4 ContributorsAnother Brick in the Wall (Part 3) LyricsI don't need no arms around me
And I don't need no drugs to calm me
I have seen the writing on the wall
Don't think I need anything at all!
No, don't think I need anything at all!
All in all it was
All just bricks in the wall
All in all you were
All just bricks in the wallYou might also likeEmbed
