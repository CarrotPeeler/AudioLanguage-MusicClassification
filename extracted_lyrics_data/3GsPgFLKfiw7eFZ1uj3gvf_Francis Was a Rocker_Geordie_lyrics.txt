1 ContributorFrancis Was a Rocker LyricsI went to a dance last night
Feeling mighty good
Asked this girl if she wanted to dance
She said that she would
Well, the band started playing "Sweet Little Sixteen"
So I  to my price
The next thing I knew I was on my back
She was rockin' like a 50's child
How was I to know that Francis
Was a rockin' rollin' fireball queen
How was I to know that Francis
Was a rockin' rollin' fireball queen
About a hundred people gathered round
And were watchin' her and me on the floor
I started prayin' that the band could stop playin'
But it kept on rockin' some more
Well the band started playin
She started sayin': "C'mon, let's rock some more!"
Well she had me in circles, I was uptight now
And I don't think my feet touched the floor
How was I to know that Francis
Was a rockin' rollin' fireball queen
How was I to know that Francis
Was a rockin' rollin' fireball queenYou might also likeEmbed
