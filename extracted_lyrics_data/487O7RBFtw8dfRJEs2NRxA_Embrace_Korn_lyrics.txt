15 ContributorsEmbrace Lyrics
Blood is pouring
Sleep is boring
Don't stop running
I'm here counting
The life, the hurt the pain, the hate
The life, the hurt the pain, the hate
The life, the hurt the pain, the hate
Will it keep fucking with me?
There's nowhere else to go

So I walk, but seem to crawl
For I've given in today
Now I run into a wall
'Cause I cannot find my way

(Ahh) You've gotta come with me
(I cannot stand this place)
(Ahh) We're falling off the world
(And I'll give in this way)
(Ahh) We had a chance to run
(And now I can't believe)
(Ahh) We're going all the way
(And I'm in death's embrace)

My life: worry
Life is story
Give up beating
I'll start healing
The life, the hurt the pain, the hate
The life, the hurt the pain, the hate
The life, the hurt the pain, the hate
Will it keep fucking with me?
There's nowhere else to go

So I walk, but seem to crawl
For I've given in today
Now I run into a wall
'Cause I cannot find my way

(Ahh) You've gotta come with me
(I cannot stand this place)
(Ahh) We're falling off the world
(And I'll give in this way)
(Ahh) We had a chance to run
(And now I can't believe)
(Ahh) We're going all the way
(And I'm in death's embrace)
Embrace, embrace, embrace, embrace
Embrace, embrace, embrace, embrace
Oh (aah)
Oh, oh, oh, oh (aah)
Oh, oh, oh, oh (aah)
Oh, oh, oh, oh (aah)
Oh, oh, oh, oh

What really do I have to follow?
Nothing makes sense at all
Taking something for nothing
Watch me as I fall
I'm bringing me down
I'm bringing me down
I'm bringing me down
I'm bringing me down

(Ahh) You've gotta come with me
(I cannot stand this place)
(Ahh) We're falling off the world
(And I'll give in this way)
(Ahh) We had a chance to run
(And now I can't believe)
(Ahh) We're going all the way
(And I'm in death's embrace)
(Ahh) You've gotta come with me
(I cannot stand this place)
(Ahh) We're falling off the world
(And I'll give in this way)
(Ahh) We had a chance to run
(And now I can't believe)
(Ahh) We're going all the way
(And I'm in death's embrace)2Embed
