No-one but me
Caught in the rain
I'm free again
Stood on the pier
No trace of tears
Right back where I started from
I know that I wasn't wrong
Right back where I started from
Down by the sea
No-one but me
Caught in the rain
I'm free again
Stood on the pier
No trace of tears
Right back where I started from
I know that I wasn't wrong
Right back where I started fromYou might also likeEmbed
