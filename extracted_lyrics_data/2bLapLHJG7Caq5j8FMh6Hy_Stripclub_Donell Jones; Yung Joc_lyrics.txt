3 ContributorsStripclub Lyrics
Ladies, I need you to stop doing what you're doing and pay attention
Let's get focused
Donell Jones is in the building
Yung Joc, let's go

Let's turn each other on, let's get into it
We can make love every hour
You already know what the business is
We gon' switch it up, let me see you grind
Play your favorite song, girl, dance to it
The way you move it's like it's your profession
Slowly take it off, girl, come over here
Turn the music up, my bedroom just became a strip club

Girl, you're dancing so slow if you give me a lap dance
We'll be making love at my strip club
We can do anything, we want no restrictions, baby, I can touch
We can do it at my strip club
No security guards, it's just us
I hear you moaning when I'm beating it up
We can make love in my strip club
On the bed, from the back, on the floor, you on top, missionary
Don't stop in my strip club
Take it off, take it off, take it off, take it off, strip club, ooh
You might also like
Slowly take it off, girl, get into it, remove everything
Except for your panties and your bra
But keep that booty bouncing
Nothing but sexing you is on my mind
'Cause you know what you're dealing with
Put scratches on my back when you reach that climax
No worries at all girl come over here
Turn the music up, my bedroom just became a strip club

Girl, you're dancing so slow if you give me a lap dance
We'll be making love at my strip club
We can do anything, we want no restrictions, baby, I can touch
We can do it at my strip club
No security guards, it's just us
I hear you moaning when I'm beating it up
We can make love in my strip club
On the bed, from the back, on the floor, you on top, missionary
Don't stop in my strip club
Take it off, take it off, take it off, take it off, strip club, ooh

Let me talk to 'em, D
Take it off, take it off, treat your body like a Kit Kat
Break it off, break it off, throw it back, throw it back
Now make it talk, make it talk
Yeah, that ass so fat, good God, it's Charmin soft, it's Charmin soft
And it's a meeting in my bedroom
I'm the boss, I'm the boss
It's like pin-ups in my penthouse
Let's keep this strip club in house
I love the way you poutin', and love your bottom lip out
See, I just keep on tippin', keep on tippin' 'til I tip out
I get by then come right back, 'cause I never had nothin' quite like that
But I like that, and I bite that
I just turn up, turn up, turn up, yeah, I Ike that
Like Turner, turn her, turn her, turn her, turn her, turn her
Turn her ass on (Ass on) to the sounds of the song
Girl, you're dancing so slow if you give me a lap dance
We'll be making love at my strip club
We can do anything, we want no restrictions, baby, I can touch
We can do it at my strip club
No security guards, it's just us
I hear you moaning when I'm beating it up
We can make love in my strip club
On the bed, from the back, on the floor, you on top, missionary
Don't stop in my strip club
Take it off, take it off, take it off, take it off, strip club, oohEmbed
