1 ContributorPeople Keep Talking LyricsThree, four, it got me on a kind of a lock down
And it gets so rough, believe what I say, yeah
Three kids, that job, that kind of leads to a break down
But it’s all I got and it’s the type that pays
Sewn up so tight, a man needs just to break out
And just run so fast and try to get away
If I’m out of sight, I let the walls come crashing in
Come on do your worst, 'cause that’s the way I play, oh
People keep talking, telling all about how I’m a let down
I’ve just had enough, I’m gonna give it away
People keep talking, telling all about how I’m a let down
But I can’t give it up, I’m just a moment away
So dry my mouth, all I need is a dust down
And I’ll fill my cup and watch it flow away
If you came to fight, let the fists come crashing in
But don’t shoot your guns, that ain’t the manly way, oh
People keep talking, telling all about how I’m a let down
I’ve just had enough, I’m gonna give it away
People keep talking, telling all about how I’m a let down
But I can’t give it up, I’m just a moment away
Oh, alright now!
The people keep talking, telling all about how I’m a let down
I’ve just had enough, I’m gonna give it away
People keep talking, telling all about how I’m a let down
But I can’t give it up, I’m just a moment away
People keep talking, telling all about how I’m a let down
I’ve just had enough, I’m gonna give it away
People keep talking, telling all about how I’m a let down
But I can’t give it up, I’m just a moment awayYou might also likeEmbed
