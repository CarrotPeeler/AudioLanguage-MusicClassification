2 ContributorsA Place To Rest LyricsLay on the ground
Taste of the shade
Save your last sound
Burn it away
Lights on the hill
Wolves on their way
As above
So below
Fight for the throne
Hunt for the horn
Dreams had been sown
War has been born
The wolf hath devoured
Where oaths hat been scorned
As above
So below
Shadows waiting for the day
Gyre and gimble in the wabe
Bastard son sent to the wall
Bastard bitch sits on the throne
Life so cheap for one so young
Flesh so soft for one so dumbYou might also likeEmbed
