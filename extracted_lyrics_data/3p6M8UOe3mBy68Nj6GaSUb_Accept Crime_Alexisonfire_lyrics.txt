Everybody on the count of three, accept crime
One, two, three
Bethlehem to Galilee, accept crime
One, two, three

Between the sheets the voyeur watches you
And each caress takes us one step further from his dire crusade
We will be free to use our bodies as we please
We will be free to use our bodies as we please

Say hey, there's no police
Hey, there's no police between two beating hearts
Hey, there's no police
Hey, there's no police between two beating hearts

Let the clergy damn our every emotion
Until every impulse is a revolution
And what we know to be good
Will lead and carry us through
It's our chance to use your disobedient free will

Say, we will be free to use our bodies as we please
We will be free to use our bodies as we please

Say hey, there's no police
Hey, there's no police between two beating hearts
Hey, there's no police (There's no police, no police)
Between two beating hearts

I feel no guilt, I won't repent
Day to day, I accept crime
That's for me to confess


Hey, there's no police
Hey, there's no police between two beating hearts
Hey, there's no police
Hey, there's no police between two beating hearts

Between two beating hearts
Between two beating hearts
Between two beating hearts
Between two beating hearts I know1Embed
