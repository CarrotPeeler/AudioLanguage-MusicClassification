2 ContributorsNobody Stayed For The DJ LyricsNobody stayed for the DJ
Nobody stayed for the DJ, bless their souls
With the eyes of the world all attuned to rock and roll
Won't you help them to understand
Won’t you help them to understand
I had a bigger plan
Now I'm spreading my wings to suspend me the way that I can
Nobody stayed for the DJ
Nobody stayed for the DJ, rest your soul
When the news of the world tears you up from head to toe
Won't you help them to understand
Won't you help them to understand
That I've been a bettеr friend?
And I'm dreaming 'bout all of the facеs from my past
Play Gino Soccio, Gino Soccio
Play Gino Soccio, Gino Soccio
I'm gonna play "Situation"
I'm gonna play "Situation" by Yazoo
And I'm hoping that life's gonna change between 1 and 2
Won't you help them to understand
Won't you help them to understand
That I had a bigger plan?
Now I'm spreading my wings until someone holds my hand
You might also likeI'll keep on waiting and wishing
I'll keep on waiting and wishing through the dunes
And the nighttime will tear me away from the things you do
When you're trying your best to dance
Oh, you're trying you're best to dance
And I'm all in love again
Now I'm spreading my wings until someone holds my hand
(When you're the DJ)
Nobody stayed for the DJ
Nobody stayed for the DJ
Nobody stayed for the DJ
Nobody stayed for the DJ1Embed
