Sometimes I realize, when I gaze in the skies
This spinning world is not my home
A place of mystery, a land of destiny
Is where I know one day I'll go

I dream of beauty I have never seen
I know the arms of heaven wait for me
And yet I feel his sweetness here and now
In this life on earth, I have found

Un lugar celestial
Just a little bit of heaven sent from above
Un lugar celestial
Where the presence of my Father hold me in his love
Un lugar celestial

When all my skies are gray, I simply steal away
Into my secret hiding place
When hearts are cold as ice, the breath of paradise
Blows warm and gentle on my face

I know I need my time alone with him
His healing waters flowing deep within
Don't have to wish upon a distant star, 'cause the light of love
Fills my heart

Un lugar celestial
Just a little bit of heaven sent from above
Un lugar celestial
Where the presence of my Father hold me in his love
Un lugar celestial

El cielo me llama
Caminando el las nubes
Dulce beso de libertad
Nubes de gloria

Un lugar celestial
Just a little bit of heaven sent from above
Un lugar celestial
Where the presence of my Father hold me in his love
Un lugar celestial
Un lugar celestial
Just a little bit of heaven sent from above
Un lugar celestial
Where the presence of my Father hold me in his love
Un lugar celestial...Embed
