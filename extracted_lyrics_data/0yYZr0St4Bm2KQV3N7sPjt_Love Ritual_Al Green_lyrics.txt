You’re the pilow of my head
Taste the wine and sacred bread
Be the words that i said
The times in life are dead
Bwana bwana

You’re the meaning of the world
Sparrow sky sacred bird
What I meant when I said to you
Love is what we've got to do
Bwana bwana
Said I want you ta

You’re the pillow of my head
Taste the wine and sacred bread
There Times in life in life were dead
Hears the words that I said
Bwana bwana
(Satisfied with you baby)
I'm drowning, I'm drowningYou might also likeEmbed
