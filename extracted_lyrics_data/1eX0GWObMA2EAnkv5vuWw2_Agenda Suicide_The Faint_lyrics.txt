7 ContributorsAgenda Suicide Lyrics
You could follow logic or contest it all
The work solution makes the common house a home
The element of progress that you mention's gone
It de-evolved to something you were headed toward

As I lay to die, the things I think, "Did I waste my time? I think I did
I worked for life"

All we want are just pretty little homes
Our work makes pretty little homes

Like a cast shadow, like a fathers dream, have a cut-out son, what's a worse disease?
To get that pretty little home

As I lay to die, the things I think, "I don't want to regret what I did
And work for life"

All we want are just pretty little homes
Our work makes pretty little homes

Agenda suicide, the drones work hard before they die
And give up on pretty little homes

Like a cast shadow, like a cast shadow
Like a cast shadow, like a cast shadow
Like a cast shadow, like a cast shadow
Like a cast shadow, like a cast shadow

Our work makes pretty little homes (Like a cast shadow, like a cast shadow)
Our work makes pretty little homes (Like a cast shadow, like a cast shadow)
Agenda suicide, the drones work hard before they die
And give up on pretty little homes3Embed
