2 ContributorsHeartbreak Radio LyricsHometown sweethearts who ran in the dark
Only made a move or two
I was just a yung school never been to night school
Did not know enough to be cool
So she found another lover
They went undercover
Then she stomped my heart into the ground
Only keep the peace by calling out the police
Finding that I lose my mind
Chorus:
Woman I love done gone and left me alone
She got a big fat record for the heartbreak radio
A complete investigation
What's her destination?
Cover on suspucion
Look at my condition
She left me here to take the fall
The group said she would play rough
She ought to be in handcuffs
Needs to wear a ball and chain
She booked at the hospital
Only I would love her
She knew how to play the game

Woman I love done gone and left me alone
She got a big fat record for the heartbreak radio
Oh mama come home
Tell me when
Tell me now
Hey mama I need you
Lonely heart
In Distress
Sending out an SOS
All across the USA
Come back and serve your time
Right here here in this hall of mine
Got to have you home today
FBI, CIA help me please
Chorus:
Woman I love done gone and left me alone
She got a big fat record for the heartbreak radio
Chorus:
Woman I love she done gone and left me alone
She got a big fat record for the heartbreak radio
Chorus:
Woman I love she done gone and left me alone
She got a big fat record for the heartbreak radioEmbed
