4 ContributorsStill Here Lyrics
You looked at me and saw what I never could see
You made me be more than I thought I could ever be
And when I needed a friend you were always there
To lift me up to make me strong
You're not gone

You're still here with me all the time, you're still here
When I close my eyes I still see you, I still feel you
And we'll never be apart, you're still here
Still here in my heart, in my heart

It's because of you I knew how it felt to be loved, oh
You made me feel beautiful 'cause you believed I was
And I will never forget how you touched my life
You made me feel like I belonged
You'll live on

You're still here with me all the time, you're still here
When I close my eyes I still see you, I still feel you
And we'll never be apart
You're still here, still here in my heart, oh

You're my life, you'll be in my life
You'll be part of me
I'll just think of you and you'll be

Still here with me all the time, oh Lord, still here
When I close my eyes, I feel you
And we'll never, never be apart, you're still here
Still here in my heart, in my heart

Still here, still here, oh, oh ah, still hereEmbed
