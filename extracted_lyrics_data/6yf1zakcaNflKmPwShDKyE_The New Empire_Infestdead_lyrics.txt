1 ContributorThe New Empire LyricsThe gates of Hell open wide
The new existence is not denied
The arrival of Satan and all his kind
All human(s) are the jokers in his deck of cards
Nothing of man can break the spell
The only way is down into Hell
The only rising fire is in the sky
Armageddon has come, this hour they die
Burning
Twice they prevail
They no longer dwell in the land of eternal fire below
Total War
Earth is now in his possession
Unholy ground of the new empire
Of Lucifer we burn
The gates of Hell open wide
The new existence is not denied
The arrival of Satan and all his kind
All human(s) are the jokers in his deck of cards
Nothing of man can break the spell
The only way is down into Hell
The only rising fire is in the sky
Armageddon has come, this hour they die
