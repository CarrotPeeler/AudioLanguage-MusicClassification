7 ContributorsDropping Out of Love Lyrics
I've been tryin' to figure out
What the fight is all about
Tired of playing like we're in love again
I guess we should've thought it out
'Cause now there's way too many doubts
Can't be going through this again, no, no, no, no

I can't imagine what I've done for you
To make me feel this way, baby
I don't understand
Ain't nobody keeping score
And it ain't about right or wrong
Who cares if you win the argument
Soooo

I'm dropping out of love
I didn't sign up for this pain
So I'm out of love
I can't take feeling this way
Dropping out of love
Think it's best, you go your way
'Cause I've had enough of this hurting, baby
You might also like
Lately you've been buggin' out
All types of madness out your mouth
You think it's funny, well, sweety, think again
I want to see how hard you laugh
You turn around and I'm not there
No apologies, no, baby, please, not again

I can't imagine what I've done for you
To make me feel this way, baby
I don't understand
Ain't nobody keeping score
And it ain't about right or wrong
Who cares if you win the argument
Soooo

I'm dropping out of love
I didn't sign up for this pain
So I'm out of love
I can't take feeling this way
Dropping out of love
Think it's best, you go your way
'Cause I've had enough of this hurting, baby
So tired of waking up too lonely tears again
If you don't see a problem
Then how can you make it end
You don't really give a damn
So why does this happen
Goodbye, baby, goodbye

I'm dropping out of love
I didn't sign up for this pain
So I'm out of love
I can't take feeling this way
Dropping out of love
Think it's best, you go your way
'Cause I've had enough of this hurting, babyEmbed
