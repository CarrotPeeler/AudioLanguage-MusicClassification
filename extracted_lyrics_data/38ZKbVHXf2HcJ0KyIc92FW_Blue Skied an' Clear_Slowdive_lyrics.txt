You say your money
In the mind
One and all (You're so hard to reach) (You're sunshine)
For another
Fall aside (You're so hard to reach) (You're sunshine)
For another
Fallen down (You're so hard to reach) (You're sunshine)
In our life

(You're sunshine)
(You're sunshine)
(You're sunshine)

You say life
And it sounds so good
You say love
And it sounds so sweet

(You're sunshine)
(Oh, sunshine)

You say your money (You're sunshine)
In the mind
What an honor (You're so hard to reach) (You're sunshine)
In the mind
Follow my (You're so hard to reach) (You're sunshine)
For another
Follow my (You're so hard to reach) (You're sunshine)
For another
