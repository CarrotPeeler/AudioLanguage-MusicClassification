1 ContributorLovinâ€™ You LyricsIt's getting light in my old town
I'm sad because you're not around
I'm lonely so lonely as I can be
Standing here without my love
Looking at that star above
Knowing that the sun of love is due
Loving loving you is so sad
Maybe leaving leaving you isn't bad
Isn't bad no no no isn't bad
Standing here a dream is fade
I quit a world of dusk and shade
Your chain of command has been silenced now
With tear filled eyes open and wide
I start walking change the side
Knowing that my love has gone
Loving loving you is so sad
Maybe leaving leaving you isn't bad
Isn't bad no no no isn't badYou might also likeEmbed
