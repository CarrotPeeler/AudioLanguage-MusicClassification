8 ContributorsHeroes LyricsI, I wish you could swim like the dolphins
Like dolphins can swim
Though nothing will keep us together
We can beat them forever and ever
Oh, we can be heroes just for one day
I, I will be king and you, you will be queen
Though nothing will drive them away
We can beat them just for one day
We can be us just for one day
I, I can remember standing by the wall
And the guns shot above our heads
And we kissed as though nothing could fall
And the shame was on the other side
Oh we can beat them forever and ever
Then we can be heroes just for one day
We can be heroes, we can be heroes
We can be heroes just for one day
We can be heroes
We're nothing and nothing will help us
Maybe we're lying
Then you better not stay
But we could be safer just for one dayYou might also likeEmbed
