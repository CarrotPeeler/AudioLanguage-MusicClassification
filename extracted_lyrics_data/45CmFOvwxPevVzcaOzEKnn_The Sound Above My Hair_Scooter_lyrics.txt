Here I go
Out to rave again
Hardcore fills the air
The sound above my hair
Lights in the sky, and in my eyes
You know it feels unfair
There's party everywhere
Here I go
Out to rave again
Hardcore fills the air
The sound above my hair
Lights in the sky, and in my eyes
You know it feels unfair
There's party everywhere
Here I go
Out to rave again
Hardcore fills the air
The sound above my hair
Lights in the sky, and in my eyes
You know it feels unfair
There's party everywhere

Lights in the sky, and in my eyes
You know it feels unfair
There's party everywhere
Here I go
Out to rave again
Hardcore fills the air
The sound above my hairEmbed
