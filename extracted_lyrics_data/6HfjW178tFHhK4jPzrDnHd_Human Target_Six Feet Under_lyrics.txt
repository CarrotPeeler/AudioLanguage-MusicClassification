My life, my soul
My thoughts are my own
I live to die
That's why I was born
Kill or be killed
The law of the land
Standing tall, I'm not running scared

Human target
Human target

Scarred, beaten
My bones were broken
Bruised, mistreated
For what I believe in
Survive or die
Fear for your life
I grip the gun tight
Three shots to the chest
One to the head
Standing tall, I'm not running scared

Living through the violence
I'm just surviving
There's no way to end this
One more dead, one survives
Instinct to live
Living through the violence
I'm just surviving
There's no way to end this
Living through the violence
I'm just surviving
There's no way to end this
One more dead, one survives
Instinct to live
I won't die

That's why I was born
Kill or be killed
The law of the land
Standing tall, I'm not running scared
Survive or die
Fear for your life
I grip the gun tight
