Bueuna serra
A Da? New York
Hazmat Modine
(Sung)
Eight yesterday morning
I couldn't get out of bed
I felt so lonely
Felt like I was dead
Don't ya know that I'm sorry?
I know, I done you wrong, yet
I hope you forgive me
How long will this go on?
I say ...
(harmonica solo)
Eight yesterday evening
You know I couldn't sleep
I want you only, baby
When can we meet?
Don't ya know that I need you?
Oh-ho-ho, that's no lie
I want you to need me too
Wo-ho, 'til the day you die
I say ...

Felt like I was dead
Don't ya know that I'm sorry?
I know, I've done you wrong, yet
I hope you forgive me
How long can this go on?
I say ...Embed
