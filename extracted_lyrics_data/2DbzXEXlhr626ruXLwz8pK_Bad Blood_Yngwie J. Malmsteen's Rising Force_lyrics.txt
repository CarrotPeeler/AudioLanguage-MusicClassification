Promises broken as the heartache seeps in
Now I'm believing all the things that I hear
Oh, no more deceiving 'cause I see you so clear
Wounds left to heal
Coldness I feel
Like ice through my veins
Bad, bad, bad blood - Don't be bringing me down
Bad blood - Can't put me in the ground
Bad blood - Bitch, you're not killing me
Bad blood - No other way it's gonna be
Your love is like prison and I'm doing time
Waiting for freedom while losing my mind
Too many reasons and too many lies
Now I'm through believin', you've opened my eyes
Wounds left to heal
Coldness I feel
Like ice through my veins
Bad, bad, bad blood - Now there's no one left to blame
Bad blood - No more lying, no more pain
Bad blood - Oh, there's nothing left to say
Bad blood - It can be no other way

Bad blood - Can't put me in the ground
