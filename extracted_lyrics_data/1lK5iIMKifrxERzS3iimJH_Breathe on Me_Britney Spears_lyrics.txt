It's so hot in here

Oh, it's so hot, and I need some air
And boy, don't stop 'cause I'm halfway there
It's not complicated, we're just syncopated
We can read each other's minds
One love united
Two bodies synchronizing
Don't even need to touch me
Baby, just

Breathe on me (Yeah)
Oh, baby, just
Breathe on me
We don't need to touch, just breathe
Oh, yeah

Oh, this is way beyond the physical (Too way beyond the physical)
And tonight, my senses don't make sense at all
Our imagination, takin' us to places
We have never been before (Never been before)
Take me in, let it out
Don't even need to touch me, baby, just
You might also like
Breathe on me (Yeah)
Baby, just
Breathe on me
We don't need to touch, just
Breathe on me (Breathe on me)
Oh, baby, just
Breathe on me (Breathe on me)
We don't need touch, just breathe (Oh)

Monogamy is the way to go
Just put your lips together and blow
Breathe, breathe, breathe, breathe
Breathe, breathe, breathe, breathe
Breathe, breathe, breathe, breathe
Breathe, breathe, breathe

Breathe on me (Oh, oh)
(Uh) Baby, just
Breathe on me
We don't need to touch, just breathe
Breathe on me (Breathe on me)
Oh baby, just
Breathe on me (Breathe on me)
We don't need to touch, just3Embed
