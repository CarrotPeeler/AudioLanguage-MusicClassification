7 ContributorsBreath Lyrics
Girl, I just wanna stay in bed with you all day
Playing the new Zelda game
We can take turns or you can just watch me
It don't matter as long as you're beside me

It's past three, you and me stay under the sheets
In our little world, my baby girl
Stay inside day and night, girl, don't leave my side
Don't know what I'd do, just come back soon

So exciting, the feeling when we fighting (Ayy, ayy)
Like lightning, your blood running in my veins (Ayy, ayy)
Ripe violence, spicing that with your scent (Ayy, ayy)
Booty cheeks like gelatin, smack that with my phallus
Panties rip 'em off the gash, quick, fast like a Band-aid
My X marks the spot, heart and dick is dug in
Everywhere you seen my face, all on a bounty
But you not starry eyed, you know all about me
There's regret in your blue craters
Did you forget you fell for a nigga?
Your mama won't, elephant for dinner, ayy
It's Goodwill, wear you out like new sweater
You might also like
Dreams of you dreaming next to me
My love, my love, my love
Dreams of you dreaming next to me
My love, my love, my love3Embed
