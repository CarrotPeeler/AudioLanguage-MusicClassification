1 ContributorUntil Dust LyricsLapse again
Into lessening light
Ailing spirit, failing mind
Downwards, mired, ending life
Steeped in pitch, black as night
Closing in and pressing on
Never ending, no bottom
Swallowed in darkness, imploring cries
Mouthless wonder, you drift and die
And climb, up through the substrate, you rise
Devolving and blind
Consuming their eyes
But the sky has other plans today
No need for words, nothing to say
Cornered tyrants left betrayed
Cower, conquered, all erased
Devolving and blind
Consuming their eyes
And for the servant, the song is absent
The verdict is just
Strung up high to hang defiant
Until the dust becomes of us
Swallowed in darkness, imploring cries
Mouthless wonder, you drift and die
Until the dust becomes of usYou might also likeEmbed
