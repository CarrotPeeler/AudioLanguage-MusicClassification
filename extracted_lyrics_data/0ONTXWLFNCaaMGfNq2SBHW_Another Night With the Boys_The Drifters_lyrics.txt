3 ContributorsDetours Lyrics
He said, she said something
He said she said the dreams left a deep sense of numbing
He left the scene less becoming
He spent a week's wage on repress of ski sledge gumming
He said, she said, something
She said the beef stemmed from weeks spent in East Ends clubbing
He said the scene meant nothing
She said the scene ripped the seams, left the streets red running
He said, she said, speak less, deep breath
Why even try to define what you find from the sky to the seabed?
He said, she said, more of the same old, warm and the grey coals
Mornings of rain, let that boredom decay in the warmth of the rainbow, he (he)
He shoulda known that the deets went deeper
Usually they flew over the nest that the bird's left weak at the end of the feature, she (she)
Well she felt dumb ‘cause he felt nothing
Pissed out her mind in her vixen disguise
Put her wisdom aside, was he red sheets fuckin'

He said, she said, she felt, mislead
Left in line with the deaf, dumb and blind
Never testing the tide, never resting to see sense, see (see)
She took steps to appease all the weeks spent
Writhing around in his weak kept secrets
Cycles and cycles of violence and deep sex, fuckin' (fuckin')
Laughter and screams from a sleep dead winter
Far from the carnage he started the car
And drove into the night till the fuel gauge blinkered
He, Mr Lay-by sleeper, she, Miss drug-fuelled ether
Calling a man and then calling her man, until the man called back at the door through the peeper
Knock knock, she sniffed lines till he called up
He said "Why are you still up?"
She said "come home", he said "alright"
More of the same just more fucked
More of the same gore hawked up
More than the great wars chalked up
Walk in the rainpour, sporting a chainsaw
Wars what you came for, based up, see
You might also like
He said, she never spoke of grief levels
Close to her beliefs heckled
Sold for 50p, settled
Broke and on the streets, nestled
Close to a release pedal
Choking on the sweet scent of closure on the beach pebbles
(Never...) Wait in line, the line allows a great divide
To make your mind evasive in the space between a place and time
Where lords are frozen, crystallized
The bubble burst, the splinters fly
Preserving mangled Lister like they curve the juicy bits inside

See he said, she said, nothing like a broken twelve
Spinning in the current with a hundred other token girls
She said he lost his marbles way before he dared to delve in
Mercilessly violent current surfing to another world
And that was that, that was then (that was then)
This is now, that was then (that was then)
Only then, did the fractures mend
When you dust it down, oh he's back again
She said she felt she opened up the guts of hell
The moment she first spoke with him and let him weave his evil spell
We're now an hour later she was none the wiser, dumb as hell
She could tell that God was merely shrapnel in the wishing well
I wish you well, (wish you well) she said
From a distant height, he fled
One hundred metre dashes on the street steps
Liquored up and senseless, swinging Maglites tryna see sense
He said, she said, back and forth the weeks went
Chaos in her dreams crept, chasms filled with regret
Summer weeks of sleep debt, winter months of weakness
He said, she said, speak less, deep breath

So I'ma take my leave
And leave behind a ghostly remnants, you can rake them leaves
(He said, he said, he said...)
Still I'ma take my time
And draw out every angle spangled in your state of mind
(She said, she said, she said...)
Yeah I'ma take that risk
You can taste them lips
You can crave that fix
(He said, he said, he said...)
Still I'ma take the piss
And make you question every single second that we don't exist
(She said, she said, she said...)

Yeah I'ma take my leave
And leave behind a ghostly remnants, you can rake them leaves
(He said, he said, he said...)
Still I'ma take my time
And draw out every angle spangled in your state of mind
(She said, she said, she said...)
Yeah I'ma take that risk
You can taste them lips
You can crave that fix
(He said, he said, he said...)
Still I'ma take the piss
And make you question every single second that we coexist
Plating up the last supper, bubbles in a dark kettle
Stomaching a large jet of rubbish 'til the tar settles
Drunkards in a dark heaven, runners on that last level
Blessed be the jarheaded fuckers in the bar fettled
She was what the storm weathered
He was but a skimming stone
Carving up the elements
A temperence he'd never known
Where one there was love
Lasting and luminous
Now there is hate
Dark and unscrupulous

They went out last night
Under the ground went in
They dropped hundrends of pounds on the stuff that the drug man done bought in
They went out last night, out on the town went in
Say drinks copt in a same hotspot to the same old (same old, same old)
He went out last night, out with the boys went in
He racked line after line after line in the bogs of the Fountain Inn
She went out last night, out where the girls went in
She downed shot after shot after shot in the hope that the phone don't ring

It did, it was, him
Silence swept the line he let the sirens speak for him
, let it, begin
Why would you the device a plot where neither party wins
We fight (we fight)
We live (we live)
We laugh and cry to pass the time outlast the life you're in
I’m done (I’m done)
You win
The ending left the landing lights to flicker in the dim
High on the underpass, five nights of reverie
Fourty-seven missing people missed the calls you sent to me
She said she knew that he'd return the calls eventually
He lost it comprehensively a thousand times a century
Every single crooked picture, every single bag of drugs
And every single spastic rolling angry in the gang of thugs
Making homes and catching drifts and breaking homes and landing fists
And taking drugs and fucking chicks

The life you live
Multicoloured marbles spilling outwards from his centerpiece
Every mortal passing feel the warmth of his incendiary
It was meant to be, there’s no need to set the scene
The naked flames flickering and cities soaked in kerosene (kerosene, kerosene)
They'll never leave 'cus leaving would be weird as hell
Who could cook him dinner then? You think that I can feed myself?
We fight, we love
We hate as well
He said, she said, speak less, save yourself

So I'ma take my leave
And leave behind a ghostly remnants, you can rake them leaves
(He said, he said, he said...)
Still I'ma take my time
And draw out every angle spangled in your state of mind
(She said, she said, she said...)
Yeah I'ma take that risk
You can taste them lips
You can crave that fix
(He said, he said, he said...)
Still I'ma take the piss
And make you question every single second that we don't exist
(She said, she said, she said...)

Yeah I'ma take my leave

Still I'ma take the piss
And make you question every single second that we coexistEmbed
