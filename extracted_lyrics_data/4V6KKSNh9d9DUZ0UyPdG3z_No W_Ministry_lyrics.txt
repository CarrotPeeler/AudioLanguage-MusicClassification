If this is really living
Then why am I so unforgiving
Half the world is down the toilet
Half is on its way
Well if I had a dollar for
Every time he hollers:
"Trust us with your hearts and minds"
Or I'll make you pay

Trust, trust, trust me
Trust, trust, trust me

Ask me why you're feeling screwed
And I'll give you an answer
There's a Colin, Dick and Bush
Just a-hammerin' away
Ask me why you feel deceived
And stripped of all your liberties
It doesn't take a genius
To explain that today
You might also like
Trust, trust, trust me
Trust, trust, trust me1Embed
