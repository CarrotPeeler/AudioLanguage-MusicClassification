2 ContributorsCon Artist Lyrics
This one goes out to all the happy people
Feeling themselves
Like I am right now

I Just got released from my latest job
Not before I scammed them motherfuckers out of 18 thou
And it Might not sound like too much but we’re talking two months now I can just grove uh
Unemployed can I get a check
What’s your pride and joy
Should I climb the highest mountain or let’s get some ighters hit the ninth floor suite
Wiz Khalifa how I keep on rolling up to the casino
Lost a band or so but I got a titanium spirit and you know I got hoes
Checking up on me
Like I was in Florida
She gropеd right there in the bar as you might еxpect my dick was growing
Rising up now like the rise up remix
Hamilton camels I gotta handle all of life’s bumps
You cannot compare me to rappers who aren’t good enough
Fuck it type blood while im out here rhyming light stuff

Ima con artist
Ima tight wad
But I could take you five rounds when the mics on
And I might
Justttt. Blaaaaast off right now
And I gotta little noggin full of novels
You can’t tell yet but it’s a problem
I'll be batman you'll be the robin
And i've beeeeen robbin
And i've beeeen robbin
You might also like
Harder than ever
Let’s get to complicating things
For all of you artists out there doing numbers? I’m coming for ya number
No chick but when I’m going out to restaurants Im blessed with the best ones
The vest on my chest if this was GTA
But it’s GTTA cuz I’m Gonna Turn this Thing Around the easy way
Not in the business of throwing my dreams away
So let’s get to starting this thing up like a dry old engine
Blowin dust off like Daraude start the car
No I’m not driving with any drifting
No I’m not sending money to a fuck mistress
You can suck it
Or fuck it
Up
Shoutout Killah L with the 5 thou plays
New career high 3 thou on the reel
So I guess we’re moving up Tone what’s the deal

Ima con artist
Ima tight wad
But I could take you five rounds when the mics on
And I might
Justttt. Blaaaaast off right now
And I gotta little noggin full of novels
You can’t tell yet but it’s a problem
I'll be batman you'll be the robin
And i've beeeeen robbin
And i've beeeen robbinEmbed
