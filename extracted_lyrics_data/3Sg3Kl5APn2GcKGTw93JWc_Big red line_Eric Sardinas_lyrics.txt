1 ContributorBig Red Line LyricsYeah
Ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh
The big red line runs on eastern time
But I'm rollin' south for sure
I'm feelin' fine baby, sweet as wine
'Cause I'm rollin' for my Rider's door
It's leadin' me by my hand
It's leadin' me by my hand
No highway signs
No worried mind
To slow me up
Or turn me 'round
'Cause the big red line's got me right on time
And I'll see ya 'fore the sun goes down
Yeah, it's leadin' me by my hand
Lord, it's leadin' me by my hand
Uh

Look out
The big red line runs on eastern time
But I'm rollin' south for sure
I'm feelin' fine baby, sweet as wine
'Cause I'm rollin' for my Rider's door
Yeah, it's leadin' me by my hand
Lord, it's leadin' me by my hand
(You know what I'm talkin' about)
It's leadin' me by my hand (yeah)
It's leadin' me by my hand
Oh, lead me on
