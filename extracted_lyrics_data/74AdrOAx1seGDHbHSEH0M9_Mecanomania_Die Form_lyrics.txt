1 ContributorRise of Violence LyricsMany people are hungry
Their home was destroyed
By a hail of bombs during war
Many people live in fear
The innocent are left to their fate
It will never be the same again
Children become orphans
The people will be forced to fight
(Forced to fight)
Don't you see it
Open your eyes
Destruction comes
Violence on the rise
Don't you see it
Open your eyеs
Destruction comes
Violencе on the rise
Many people live in war
Their houses no longer exist
Feelings of fear and pain in their head
Families are torn apart
You might also likeManslaughter takes place in everyday life
It will never be the same again
Parents lose their children
You can't decide whether you want to fight
(Want to fight)
Don't you see it
Open your eyes
Destruction comes
Violence on the rise
Don't you see it
Open your eyes
Destruction comes
Violence on the rise
Megalomania decides
Whether thousands die
Dictators write with blood
Die, die for peace?
Million people take refuge
Life in a confined space
No future in mind
Who's there to help?
Don't you see it
Open your eyes
Destruction comes
Violence on the rise
Don't you see it
Open your eyes
Destruction comes
Violence on the riseEmbed
