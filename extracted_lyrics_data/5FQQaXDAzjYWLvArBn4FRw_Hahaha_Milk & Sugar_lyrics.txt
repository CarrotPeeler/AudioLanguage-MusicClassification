1 ContributorPlain LyricsI was out tooling around the other day with a friend
He said, uh, “Hey, you wanna go get some lunch?”
I said, “Sure, you buying? Hahaha”
Well, uh, he wasn’t, but anyway
We went and got some lunch
Uh, he ordered a burger then he continued
“I want ketchup and mustard
Mayo and cheese
All the veggies, man
Anything that’s green
Salsa, hot sauce, some buffalo
Ranch, Italian, French
All the dressings, you know”
(“Uh, how do you want that cooked?”)
He said, “Grill it, fry it, bake it, nuke it
Anything in that shaker over there?
Shake it on, I like more of that
Aw, some pеppers and jalapenos
And bananas, so hot!
Chardonnaire? Oh, I lovе that stuff
Pile on a lot!”
Maybe I’m a simple kind of guy
Easily amused
Nothing at all is just fine
You might also likeYou know what I said?
I like it plain
(Hold the ketchup, hold the cheese)
I like it plain
(Hold the peppers, yeah, they make me sneeze)
Just make mine plain
(Hold the sauces, hold the buffalo)
I like it plain
(Hold the mustard, please, make it to go)
So, then, uh, later on, I went out for coffee
Same buddy of mine, big mistake
Well, I just got a coffee, ya know?
I wanted coffee
See, he got a latte
Is that enough? No, he continued to say
“I need sugar, honey, milk, if you please
Regular? No no no, give me that heavy whipping cream
Nutmeg, spices, cinnamon
Man, oh, make it a double shot, do you think, if you can, would that be okay?”
Maybe I’m a simple kind of guy
So easily amused
I don’t need a lot to get by
Seriously, man, it’s coffee
I like it plain
(Hold the sugar, hold the cream)
I like it plain
(Hold the honey, yeah, it gets me sticky)
Coffee? I like it plain
(Hold the spices, hold the cinnamon)
No no, just make it plain
(Hold espresso, make it black if you can)
I like it plain
(Hold the sugar, hold the cream)
I like it plain
(Hold the honey, gets me sticky)
I like it plain
(Hold the spices, hold the cinnamon)
I like it plain
(Hold espresso, make it black if you can)
I like it plain
(Hold the ketchup, hold the cheese)
I like it plain
(Hold the peppers, yeah, they make me sneeze)
I like it plain
(Hold the sauces, hold the buffalo)
Just make it plain!
(Hold the mustard, please, make it to go)Embed
