1 ContributorThe Memory of Our Love LyricsYou threw away your heart
And you got back a stone
You saw a strong man crying
But it left you cold
And yeah my love
I wonder how you could, yeah
The memory of our love
Is still misunderstood
When I was your every man
A mirror to yourself
You woke up in my eyes
And you slept as someone else
And yeah, how I tried, I tried to do you good
Yeah, but the memory of my love
Is still misunderstood
And I tell you one more time
Now you're acting strange
I get to know the third of you
Controlling heart and soul
With a mind that's full of blues
Yeah, but baby, when the blues gets in your soul
You better take a look and then you'll see
That the memory of that love
Will still be misunderstood, yeah

I wrote this song for you
I wrote those words for me
Because you're so damn blind
This part of you I couldn't see
Yeah, but baby, I love you anyway
Because the memory of our love
In my soul is here to stayEmbed
