1 ContributorPink-O-Boogie Lyrics
Now there's a new dance going 'round the whole town's talking about
It's socially uplifting boys, it sure is wearing me out
All my low friends in high places they won't talk to me no more
They can't take no chances being seen on the dance floor

That Pink-o Boogie's fun baby, the Pink-o Boogie's hot
Now the Pink-o Boogie's got the thing you Republicans just ain't got
Oh the Pink-o Boogie's cool baby, the Pink-o Boogie's new
I'Il join the Party baby if they let me party with you

Well I like tight action, I Iike loose fittin' shoes
I like slow dancin' to the good ole country blues
Well I like the FBI, the Secret Service too
Now I'd like to see J. Edgar doin' the Pink-o Boogie with you
Do it!

The Pink-o Boogie's tight baby, gone right to my head
Gonna do the Pink-o Boogie till I get cherry red
Pink-o Boogie's fun baby, now the Pink-o Boogie's hot
Bend over and let ole Kash Buk see just what else you got

You might also like
The Pink-o Boogie's fun baby, the Pink-o Boogie's hot
Well the Pink-o Boogie's got the thing you Republicans just ain't got
Pink-o Boogie's cool baby, the Pink-o Boogie's new
I'Il join the Party baby if they let me do the Pink-o Boogie with you

Pink-o Boogie
