1 ContributorI Wear My Skin LyricsI wear my skin like it's not a problem
Or is it a problem for you?
My past writes the page I walk on
Today writes the past for
I wage my war in the name of living
Or is it the killing you choose?
The pill is a bright condition
The pain but the souls I use
(Night comes in, night comes in)
I, I wish you happiness
I, I wish you all success I do
Time will bring you many things
Life will bring you all good things
I wear my skin like it's not a problem
Or is it a problem for you?
My past writes the page I walk on
Today writes the past for
I wage my war in the name of living
Or is it the killing you choose?
The pill is a bright condition
The pain but the souls I use
(The pain but the souls I, the pain but the souls)

I see your hell; my mind is made up to be
I know your pain; my mind is made up for me
I see your hate; my mind is made up to be
Punch back punch back
You're so fucking easy, punch back throw
Punch back punch back
You're so fucking easy, punch back throw
Punch back punch back
You're so fucking easy, punch back throw
Punch back punch back
You're so fucking easy, punch back
I wear my skin like it's not a problem
Or is it a problem for you?
My past writes the page I walk on
Today writes the past for
I wage my war in the name of living
Or is it the killing you choose?
The pill is a bright condition
The pain but the souls I useEmbed
