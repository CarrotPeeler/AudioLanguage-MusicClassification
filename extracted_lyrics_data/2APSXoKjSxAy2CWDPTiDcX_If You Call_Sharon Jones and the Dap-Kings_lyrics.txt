3 ContributorsIf You Call Lyrics
I've been laying alone for hours
But I haven't slept at all
These eyes are closed but I'm listening
For your call, for your call

These feet, too tired for walking
And these knees, too weak to crawl
But these arms are strong enough to hold you
If you call, if you call

Am I dead, or am I living?
I feel no blood in these veins
But I could live, live and die like this forever
If I know I'll taste your lips again

Doctor, doctor, come cut my heart out
'Cause it hardly, oh, beats at all
But please, please, leave a little portion
Just in case my baby calls
Just in case, oh, my baby calls

If you call, if you call
