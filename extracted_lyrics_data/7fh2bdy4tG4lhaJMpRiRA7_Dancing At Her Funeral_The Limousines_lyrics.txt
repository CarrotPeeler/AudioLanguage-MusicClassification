3 ContributorsDancing at Her Funeral Lyrics
Hey! Hey!
Hey! Hey!
Hey! Hey!

Decorated in lights and surrounded by traffic cones
There was a car crash wrapped around a telephone pole
Soft layer of firefighter's chemical foam
The stranger's favorite song still playing on the radio

Nobody knows the trouble I've seen
The trouble I've been through
The trouble I've been through
Nobody knows the trouble I've seen
The trouble I've been through

And as the ambulance takes her to the hospital
The only words she can say are, "Can you take me home?"
Before her spirit escapes her as a soft blue glow
Oh, no, oh, no

Nobody knows the trouble I've seen
The trouble I've been through
The trouble I've been through
Nobody knows the trouble I've seen
The trouble I've been through
You might also like
And we'll be dancing at her funeral
Dancing at her funeral
Dancing at her funeral
Dancing, dancing

Now they're digging a hole, cutting her name in stone
Sending out invitations to her friends back home
Digging a hole, cutting her name in stone
Oh, no, oh, no

Nobody knows the trouble I've seen
The trouble I've been through
The trouble I've been through
Nobody knows the trouble I've seen
The trouble I've been through

Hey! Hey!
Hey! Hey!
Hey! Hey!
Ooh, ooh
Dancing at her funeral
Ooh, ooh
And we'll be dancing at her funeral
Nobody knows the trouble I've seen
The trouble I've been through
The trouble I've been through
Nobody knows the trouble I've seen
The trouble I've been through
The trouble I've been through
Nobody knows the trouble I've seen
The trouble I've been through
The trouble I've been through
Nobody knows the trouble I've seen
The trouble I've been throughEmbed
