1 ContributorBout it, Bout it LyricsI came up on that old shit
That white tee, Reebok, and that Girbaud shit
That Pepsi Super Fair at that Superdome shit
Look, this is New Orleans, we on some home shit
So shouts out to No Limit
And that old Cash Money, not that new business
Rest in peace to Mr. Magic and to Soulja Slim and
K.C. Redd, Lil Snupe, and the Magnolia misses
But back to what I came for
Because I ain't work that hard to stay the same bruh
And I ain't get that degree to stay in the same hood
But when I got back home, I came to the same hood
Marengo off Freret
Thats just a hop, skip, and a jump from out the 'jects
Thats where the trunk pop, lift, and then they at your neck
This isn't trap rap homie, this is about respect
And I ain't even trying hard
This ain't hot, I just rely on that nostalgia card
I got the mic and I ain't handing off
My name known from California to Kandahar
So old school, got these women riding my handlebars
I'm fiending for a Jasmine, Aladdin climbing the palace walls
I'm starting to get a little ratchet
Who trying to take a shot with your boy Adam?
That's laughter on this track boy
No ghostwriter, cause ain't no Casper on this track
I said respect to P. Miller, but I'm the master on this track
I spit disaster on this track
Boy I'm the answer on this track
So no further questions
Sit your ass down, class back in sessionYou might also likeEmbed
