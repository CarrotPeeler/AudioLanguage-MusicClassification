Spinning mass, matter collapses
Light contorted and nothing passes
Frame dragging photon sphere
Light distorted and disappears

Swallowed by darkness
We fade into nothingness

Tidal force solar masses
Endless density, cosmic casket
Transcending, we near the threshold
The threshold

Swallowed by darkness
We fade into nothingness
Here we are at the event horizon
Growing red within rapid rotation

Particles expanding
Consuming surroundings
A day of reckoning for all of us
Mass еnergy, linear position
Electric chargе, angular momentum
A day of reckoning for all of us
The day of reckoning is upon us

Spinning mass, matter collapsed
Light contorted and nothing passed
Beyond the point of no return
All of man reduced to worm

Here we are at the event horizon
Growing red within rapid rotation
Here we are at the event horizon
Growing red swallowed by darkness

Here we are at the event horizon
Growing red within rapid rotationEmbed
