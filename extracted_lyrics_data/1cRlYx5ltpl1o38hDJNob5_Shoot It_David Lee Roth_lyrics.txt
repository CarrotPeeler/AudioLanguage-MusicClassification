2 ContributorsShoot It LyricsWell, look at me, got me in her sights
Is this a blessing in disguise?
Fatality on a Saturday night, wooh
Right between the eyes
Well, honey I know you never satisfied
Just a pair a dice on a roll
Gotta take the fat chance, this ain't suicide
Sit back and let it all unfold
You better shoot it, shoot it
C'mon baby put your best shot on me
Shoot it, shoot it
Girl you gotta do it for a friend in need, wow
Shoot it, shoot it
Beggers can't be choosers in a den of thieves
Is it good for you
'Cause it's good for me
How's your love life, how's your sister?
Ooh, I can't resist her
Is this the one that gets away?
Well, I can tell ya my friend
That it's all how much you spend, baby
Not how much you make

Honey listen to me
Shut your mouth an' hit the floor
And you can tell 'em last night
That you was blind to see
Or blame it all on rock'n'roll
You better shoot it, shoot it
C'mon baby put your best shot on me
Shoot it, shoot it
Girl you gotta do it for a friend in need
Better not be talkin' about me, baby
Shoot it, shoot it
Beggers can't be choosers in a den of thieves
Is it good for you
It's good for me, well alright
Whoo, dressed to the nines
Don't cry wolf too many times, baby
But you can trust in me
Want some good clean fun?
Well, I heard you play with guns
And I see you got a vacancy
You say you don't wanna dance
Honey listen to me
Shut your mouth and hit the floor
And you can tell 'em last night
That you was blind to see
And blame it all on rock'n'roll

I'm just a movin' target, mama

You pull your gun, you better shoot it, shoot it
C'mon baby put your best shot on me
