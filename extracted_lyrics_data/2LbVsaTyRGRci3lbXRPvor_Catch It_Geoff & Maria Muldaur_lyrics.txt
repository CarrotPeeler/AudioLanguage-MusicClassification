1 ContributorCatch It LyricsIf you want to ride the road
You have to pay the toll
If you want a gushing geyser
You have to dig yourself a bunch of dusty little holes
And if you want good, good loving
You gotta love with a little soul
Remember now, 
To get just about what you bring
You gotta catch it
Ah, catch it while you can
You have to plow the ground
Before you can plant your seed
If you want fine, fine crops
You got to steady up all them nasty little weeds
And if you want good loving
You got to understand your baby's needs
Remember now, 
To get just about what you bring
You better catch it
Ah, catch it while you can
You might also likeAnd if you want good loving
You got to understand your baby's needs
Remember now, 
You get just about what you bring
You're gonna catch it
Go get it, catch it while you canEmbed
