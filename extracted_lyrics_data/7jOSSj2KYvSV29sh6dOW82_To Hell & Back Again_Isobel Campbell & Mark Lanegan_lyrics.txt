3 ContributorsTo Hell & Back Again LyricsI'm in a spin, I cannot win
I've been to hell and back again
My doctor knows, he comes and goes
For what am I to do? I need him so
My sister says that I should rest
She's been there too and she knows best
His spirit's close, I love the most
The Father, Son, and Holy Ghost
Nothing to fear when he draws near
As the twilight falls to wipe away your tears
When he laid me down, when he brought me round
My baby's breath, the sweetest sound
I'm in a spin, I cannot win
I've been to hell and back again
And back again, and back again
And back again, come back againYou might also likeEmbed
