4 ContributorsPerfect Fit Lyrics
Now baby just lately you've been holding back too much
Your looks and my language, this could be the perfect touch
What you are asking fits with everything on my list
This could be the perfect fit

Tell me that it's madness to want something quite like this
But they don't understand the magic that I can't resist
Oh and wouldn't it be so tragic if everything just went amiss
And this could be the perfect fit

They say no one is perfect
Some people might take the piss
And we say we're just friends, come on
Tell me what's wrong with this
But I say keep it simple (Keep it simple)
When we haven't started yet
And this could be the perfect fit

See that dress you're wearing
Say it suits you right down to the ground
Tell me where in my world a better loving woman can be found?
Well I've searched high and low now
And from where that you and I sit
And this could be the perfect fit
You might also like

See that dress you're wearing (That dress you're wearing)
Suits you right down to the ground
(Suits you right down to the ground)
Tell me where in my world a better loving woman can be found?
And I've searched high and low now (Searched high and low)
And from where that you and I sit (Oh)
Baby, this could be the perfect fit

Baby, this could be the perfect fit
Come on baby, this could be the perfect fit
Fit, fit, fit, fit, fit, fit, fit, fit, say again
This could be the perfect fit
Fit, fit, fit, fit, fit, fit, fit, fit, fit
This could be the perfect fitEmbed
