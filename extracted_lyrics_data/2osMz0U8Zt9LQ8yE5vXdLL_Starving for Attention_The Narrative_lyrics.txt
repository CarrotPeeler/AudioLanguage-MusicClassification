2 ContributorsStarving For Attention Lyrics
These girls are cut out from magazines
Wearing pride on fashionable sleeves
Corner boys with swerving glances
Settle into landmark trances
Those poor bastards never stand a chance

And I know you would like to leave me shaking
From all the things that you're insinuating
Don't you say now look at what you made me
'Cause I don't give a damn about you now

You once said that beauty lies in truth
Mother's curves and ignorance of youth
Lonely now with this disease
Your desperation aims to please
While starving for attention on your knees

And I know you would like to leave me shaking
From all the things that you're insinuating
Don't you say now look at what you made me
'Cause I don't give a damn about you now
You might also like
Wait, I think you're better off just getting, just getting some sleep
'Cause you've been drinking like you need it again
And hey, you know you were beautiful when you were, when you were like me
Yeah, but how you slipping at the start of the end
Wait I think your better off just getting, just getting some sleep
'Cause you've been drinking like you need it again

And I know you would like to leave me shaking
From all the things that you're insinuating
Don't you say now look at what you made me
'Cause I don't give a damn about you
I don't give a damn about you nowEmbed
