1 ContributorRetaliation LyricsHEAR A SONG ABOUT THE END
MY LAST WILL AND FINAL STATEMENT
REPLACED BY AN ANTHEM OF FEAR
DESTRUCTION ON REPEAT THE END IS DRAWING NEAR
PUT EXPRESSION IN YOU EYES
THE TIME IS NOW IT'S TIME TO REALIZE
WOULD YOU LIKE TO CRAWL IN HERE
BURIED ALIVE NO RETURN I DISAPPEAR
RETALIATION CREATURES COME BACK FROM THE DEAD
RATALIATION JUSTICE TODAY
HERE'S YOUR PRICE IT'S YOUR TURN TO PAY
RETALIATION FRIEND WITHOUT A FACE
HOW LONG WILL YOU SUFFER ALONE
IN THE CROWD WAITING FOR JUCTICE
HEAR A SONG ABOUT THE END
MY LAST WILL AND FINAL STATEMENT
SO PUT EXPRESSION IN YOU EYES
THE TIME IS NOW IT'S TIME TO REALIZE
YOUR DAY IS DOWN AND DARKNESS
FALLS FROM THE WINGS OF NIGHT
BURIED ALIVE NO RETURN I DISAPPEAR
THROUGH THE MOUNTAINS HIGH AND VALLEYS LOW
DEATH MARCH FOLLOW THE DEMIGOD
A BLOODLET COLLAPS TO CONQUER
CONFRONT ADORE THE OVERLORD
FROM SOUTH OF HEAVEN TO DEPRESS
DISCHARED WITH FUNERAL REQUEST
NEW DESTINATION
CRUELTY HANDS DEATH BUT OBSESSEDYou might also likeEmbed
