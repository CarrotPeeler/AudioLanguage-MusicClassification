Cemented till the end of time
Can't undo what's been done
Foundation has been worn and torn
Broken till the end of time
All the years I lost
Numb till the end of time
This is our home
This home has been broken
Overran in darkness
Ours to haunt us till the end
Laying in anguish night after night
Peace in the darkest of places
Comfort in the loneliest of days
I and I, I and I till the end of time
Broken till the end of time
All the years I lost
Numb til the end of time
This is our home
I built this home from the ground up
Broken and torn, this is my home
This is my home
You might also likeI found peace in darkness, and comfort in solitude
There's no love or feeling in this broken home
I and I until the end of time
I and I until the end time
I and I till the end time
Till the end timeEmbed
