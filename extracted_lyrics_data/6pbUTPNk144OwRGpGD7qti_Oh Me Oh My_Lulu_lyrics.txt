1 ContributorOh Me Oh My (Iâ€™m a Fool For You Baby) Lyrics
To make you laugh, I'd play the fool for you
Although the people turn and stare
I'd give my everything to keep you, boy
Oh, it breaks my heart when you're not there

I'll stage a ballet on a table top
Command performance finger size
Though I ain't got no tune, my show won't flop
'Cause I'll find the music in your eye

Oh me, oh my
I'm a fool for you, baby
Oh me, oh my
Well, I'm crazy, said I'm crazy
Oh me, oh my
I'm a fool for you, baby
Let your love light shine on me

We'll blow a genie from a cigarette
We'll take a magic carpet ride
We'll tell our smoky friend, now don't forget
You must keep us side by side
You might also like
Oh me, oh my
I'm a fool for you, baby
Oh me, oh my
Well, I'm crazy, yes, I'm crazy, crazy
Oh me, oh my
I'm a fool for you, baby
Just let your love light shine on me
Listen to me, baby
Oh me, oh my
I'm a fool for you, baby
Oh me, oh my
Well, I'm crazy, said I'm crazy, crazy, crazy
Oh me, oh my
I'm a fool for you, baby
Just let your love light shine on meEmbed
