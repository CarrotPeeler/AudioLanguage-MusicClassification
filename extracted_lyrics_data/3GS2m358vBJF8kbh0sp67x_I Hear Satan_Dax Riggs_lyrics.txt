4 ContributorsI Hear Satan LyricsOn a black swan
Notice the moon is gone
Dancin' in the ashes of the morn
My head so full of blood
Let's pretend we've not been born
Dancin' in the ashes of the morn
I hear Satan
Invoke the shadow of doom
Hold onto your black baloon
There is no flower in bloom
Ghost born in death town
Blood kings and clowns
Dancin' in the ashes of the morn
I hear Satan (ooooohhhh)
I hear Satan
I hear Satan in the basement of the... Pentagon
