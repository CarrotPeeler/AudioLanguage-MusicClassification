2 ContributorsSinead Oâ€™Connor On TV LyricsI think you're pretty and you even
Look like you've thought things out
But you're so disappointing
With your shaved head and those mystery eyes
You smile embarrassed, like you know what's going on
But you just stand still, like you can just go along
With the cheap illustrations of your
Most important dreams
What do you think you're doing?
Wasting your tears for the camera's eye
I don't doubt that at one time
You meant it, but your posing
And your pouting's not going to make me cry
For some ad executive's idea of
What your sex would give
To be on television
C'mon have a sense of humor!
I wanna believe but you just make
Me sneer, 'cause it's the same
Emotions that they use to sell me beer
You don't have to go along with their world
You don't have to go along
You can put your shirt back on...You might also likeEmbed
