20 ContributorsNitro Lyrics
'17 S550 seats and it was navy shit
American gangster like preacher in the 80's
Deliver pie to your door like a pizza, if you pay me (Huh?)
Maniac rap, these niggas is crazy, hold up
Ayo, these niggas is brazy, hold up
Don't make a move, don't make a sound, nigga
At your kids' daycare with the pound, nigga (Boom-boom-boom-boom-boom-boom-boom-boom)
Don't make a peep, nigga
At your nana' nursin' home with the street sweeper (Brr)
Hall & Nash, we elite, nigga (Talk to 'em)
God bless all the street niggas (Uh-huh)
Told the youngin when you buck fifty 'em, take a piece with ya (Hahahaha)
These a thousand dollars each sneaker
The rich, righteous teacher
Fucked your bitch for some Rihanna creepers
These fuck niggas can't keep up
Had to drag the Goyard when I re'd up
Had to drag the Goyard when I re'd up
Watch yo' homies, them niggas'll J Reed ya (I tell 'em)
Show a nigga love, he'll still deceive ya (I've seen it)
That's why I keep the 40, I know the procedure (I know what's poppin', nigga)
Them boys droppin' bodies for the bands though (Bet)
Hide them dead bodies in the bandos (Hahaha)
Gosha tee camo
Hanging out the Bentley truck like Rambo (Doot-doot-doot-doot-doot-doot-doot-doot-doot-doot-doot-doot)
Face on the lightpole with the candle
These niggas don't even miss ya
These niggas won't even kiss ya
Fuck them niggas, we gon' air 'em out
Supply 350's 'til I wear 'em out
Supply 350's, these pairs ain't out (Ha)
Niggas tuck they chains around us, they don't wear 'em out (They pussy)
Grab 'em by the throat, your jug vein, I'ma tear it out (Come here)
You ever ran into the devil?
I took this fly shit to another level (Uh)
Coke pots next to the tea kettle (Yeah, lemme get this)
I had your ass floating, sea level
You might also like
Yo, all my niggas kings, all my chicks is fancy
My hand in my bitch's panties while I'm sipping Brandy
Shells I stuffed in the swammy probably lift a Camry
Likely to catch another case before I win a Grammy
My little brother like Machine Gun, 'cause he a savage
That 40 make you lose weight without eating salad
Gave him a gun, now he around town reekin' havoc
Got knocked once, and heard y'all downtown singing ballads
Niggas up in Comstock carvin' faces
Got public defenders going against the strongest cases
If you want that, we have you make extortion payments
They come around once a month like a mortgage payment
If you late,we fuck you up and still charge inflation
Better watch your fucking mouth when you talk to gangsters
I eat with the bosses, and still hang with henchmen
Always spoke anony' when my name get mentioned
O's, I cooked them up in the strangest kitchens
Tossed bullets for bucks like I was Jameis Winston
I know niggas who never told, 'cause they plug the brother
Sly Green numbers, and never get to hug they mothers
I got homies who bought Rollies not to check the time
But most of us caught bids, and then perfected crime
And some niggas stood up, and they took extra time
When they come home they legends like me, West, and Con
Uh, upper echelon
When they come home they legends like me, West, and Con, uhEmbed
