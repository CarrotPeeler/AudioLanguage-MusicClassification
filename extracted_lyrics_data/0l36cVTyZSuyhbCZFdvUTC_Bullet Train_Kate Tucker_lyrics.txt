1 ContributorBullet Train LyricsSo you’ve got it made
Sunlight on your grave
The golden age
Of light and shade
You’ve got it made
So you’re going black
Train is off the track
You cross your heart
You cross the tracks
You’re going black
The hunter held a holy ghost
And he came to me
And I was overthrown
So you lost your nerve
Wrapped around the curve
Blood in your veins
You took that train
You lost your nerve
So the river’s wide
From the other side
The water’s deep
The water’s wide
On the other side
The hunter held a holy ghost
And he came to me
And I was overthrown
Well’s on fire
Cold desire
For somebody
Outside
So you’ve got it made
Sunlight on your grave
Wind in your veins
That old ghost train
It lost its way
You’ve got it made
You’ve got it made
You've got it madeYou might also likeEmbed
