It's a clear day out
It's a clear day out
It's a clear day out
Gonna find all your troubles
Gonna send them away
Gonna make you feel happy
Gonna be what you say
It's a clear day out
It's a clear day out
It's a clear day out
It's a clear day out
Gonna walk through your doorway
Gonna be what you say
Gonna take all your troubles
Gonna kiss them away
True
It's a clear day
It's a clear day
