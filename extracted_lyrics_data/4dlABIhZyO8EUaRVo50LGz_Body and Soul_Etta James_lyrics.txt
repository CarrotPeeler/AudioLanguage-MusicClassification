2 ContributorsBody and Soul LyricsMy heart is sad and lonely
For you I cry, for you dear only
I tell you I mean it?
I'm all for you, body and soul
I spend my days in longing
And wondering why it's me you're wronging
Why haven't you seen it?
I'm all for you, body and soul
I can't believe it, it's hard to conceive it
That you'd turn away romance
Are you pretending? Don't say it's the ending
I wish I could have one more chance to prove, dear
My life is hell you're making
You know I'm yours for just the taking
I'd gladly surrender
Myself to you, body and soul
I can't believe it, it's hard to conceive it
That you'd turn away from romance
Are you pretending? Don't say it's the ending
I wish I could have one more chance to prove, dear
My life is hell you're making
You know I'm yours for just the taking
I'd gladly surrender, dear
Myself to you, body and soulYou might also likeEmbed
