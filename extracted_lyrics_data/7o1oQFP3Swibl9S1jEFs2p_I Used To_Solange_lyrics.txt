5 ContributorsI Used To Lyrics
I still remember the first time I met you
A nice december night i went to
A lil' party with my girl 'cause she
Told me w'd have a good time but not expected
To get to met the one i see over and over in my dreams
That would be you my use to be baby
I use to think of you as the only one for me

I use to think of you
More than anything else in this world
You use to tell me no one else could ever fit
In the place your girl
But me, it use to kill me not to see your face
I use to, now thats all I can say
Is I use to baby

Sittin' in my bed just lettin' my head
Go through all the great times we shared
Go to the movies and so frequently
Just wanted to be in your arms
Remember the time when you gave me the bear
With the message that I was always on your mind
Am i on your mind? right now
Is that how you felt at the time
Is the how you use to feel
You might also like
I use to think of you
More than anything else in this world
You use to tell me no one else could ever fit
In the place your girl
But me, it use to kill me not to see your face
I use to, now thats all I can say
Is I use to baby

All those words that you said
Do they mean anythin' now
That you'd always be there
Your not here so how could
It be true all i can say is I use to

I use to think of you
More than anything else in this world
You use to tell me no one else could ever fit
In the place your girl
But me, it use to kill me not to see your face
I use to, now thats all I can say
Is I use to babyEmbed
