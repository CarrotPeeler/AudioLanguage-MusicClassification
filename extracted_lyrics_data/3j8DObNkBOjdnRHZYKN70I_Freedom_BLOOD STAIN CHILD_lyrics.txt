1 ContributorFreedom LyricsMind that longs for peace
Endless war, it's our mind
What is peace? Sorrow, pain, anger
The world where those all do not live
Peace doesn't exist if there is no dark
Everyone understands, how should we advance?
People live android-like on here
Why can you feel happiness?
Why can you laugh and try?
This world is made in light and dark
Angry, feels sorry and painful
Still, the world that can be laugh, it is tomorrow for which we hope
We can stay this space
It is our universe
We can feel this space
Sightless, where is peace? Endless, what is peace?
(We can stay this stardust endless space)
Dive into the freedom
(We can feel stardust endless space)
Lasting, where is our space? Trusting, what is our space?

Life, peace, space, live
And universe, feel, fly
No, we can stay here
We can stay this space
It is our universe
We can feel this space
Sightless, where is peace? Endless, what is peace?
(We can stay this stardust endless space)
Dive into the freedom
(We can feel stardust endless space)
Lasting, where is our space? Trusting, what is our space?Embed
