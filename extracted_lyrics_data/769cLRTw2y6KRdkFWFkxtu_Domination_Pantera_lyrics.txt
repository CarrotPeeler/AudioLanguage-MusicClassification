(First take like a motherfucker)

Agony is the price that you'll pay in the end
Domination consumes you then calls you a friend
It's a twisted fall
Binds are like steel and manipulates the will to be
And it's hard to see how soon we forget
When there's nothing else left to destroy, it's a useless ploy

Your eyes will see the dawn of the day
And the writing on the wall
Those words that stare into your soul
And to yourself, you will befall

It's domination, pushed into living hell
Domination, yeah

A now blacked heart is reaching out in divinity
Bodies suspended by chains over razors and nails, it's a penalty
Each razor, a vice and each nail marks demise of your life
Grim construction grows, has life played a trick?
Sealed you in brick by brick till your end forcing you to bend
You might also like
Your eyes will see the dawn of the day
And the writing on the wall
Those words that stare into your soul
And to yourself you will befall

It's domination, pushed into living hell
Oh, domination, oh ha ha ha ha ha
