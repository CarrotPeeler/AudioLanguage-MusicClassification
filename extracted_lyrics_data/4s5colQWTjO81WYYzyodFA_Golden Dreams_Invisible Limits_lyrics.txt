1 ContributorGolden Dreams LyricsI fly in space
Flying from star to star
Feel the heat in me
It's a big long street
Where I go straight on
Don't look back anymore
In front of me
There's an empty space
I've no idea where I am
Golden Dream, Endless Sleep
Whispers in my ear
Desert sand in my hand
I travel in the space
Flying from star to star
Feel the heat in me
Ghost visions follow me
Voices whisper my name
And I began to run
Golden Dream, Endless Sleep
Golden Dream, Endless Sleep
Ghost visions follow me
Voices whisper my name
And I began to run

I wake up and I guess
I am here in the grass
Golden Dream, Endless Sleep...Embed
