2 ContributorsAddicted LyricsI wish I could forget your stupid name
It's always staring right back at me
Though everbody told me you were lame
I thought that you were meant to be
The reason why I dream at night
But now I'm losing sleep
You're addictive
And its driving me to drink
Your name it bleeds so endlessly
You'll always be a part of me
Yeah -- you're addictive
I wish that I could scratch you off my mind
But I'm still sleeping in your t-shirts
Of all the little scars you left behind
There's only one that hurts
And that's the reason why I cry at night
And crave you every day
You're addictive
And its driving me to drink
I can't fix it
You were meant to be a fling
So addictive
And this needle filled with ink
Your name it bleeds so endlessly
You'll always be a part of me
You might also likeYou're addictive
And I tried so hard to quit
I just can't get over it
Can't believe it's come to this
You're addictive
And it's driving me to drink
I can't fix it
You were meant to be a fling
You're addictive
Your name it bleeds so endlessly -- yeah
You're addictive
And its driving me to drink
I can't fix it
You were meant to be a fling
So addictive
And this needle filled with ink
Your name it bleeds so endlessly
You'll always be a part of meEmbed
