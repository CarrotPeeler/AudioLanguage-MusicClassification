Religious fools want to control our lives - Fuck them!
America is filled with God fearing Christians that follow along
Being brainwashed by leaders Since the day they were born
Don't listen to a god Don't listen to your rulers We don't need them
All they do is take our freedom away
Religious fools want to control our lives - Fuck them!
Religious fools want to control our lives - Fuck them!
The leaders know how to control Justifying their wars
Killing others in the name of god Every child that gets baptized
Their heads get filled with lies Manipulated by religion
Manipulated by politicians Conditioned since they're young to conform
They don't question anything Religious fools blindly follow
Religious fools fuck with our lives
Religious fools bash our heads in With their Christian Morals
Religious fools blindly follow
Religious fools fuck with our lives
Religious fools bash our heads in With their Christian Morals I don't need
Religious fools want to control our lives - Fuck them!
America is filled with God fearing Christians that follow along
Being brainwashed by leaders Since the day they were born
