22 ContributorsFuck Time Lyrics
Oh, drop your laundry and slam the door
I want your love, so gimme more
I'm a beggar, but I don't want a dime
Ah...

Oh, baby, baby, it's fuck time
You know I really wanna make you mine
Oh, baby, baby, it's fuck time
There's nothing left to say, yeah

Take a look into my eyes
I wanna hold you 'til you're paralyzed, whoa!

Oh, Amanda Jones, your holy grace
I wanna choke you 'til you're blue in the face
Got dirty thoughts and a dirty mind
Ah...

Oh, baby, baby, it's fuck time
You know I really wanna make you mine
Oh, baby, baby, it's fuck time
There's nothing left to say, yeah

I wanna hold you 'til you're paralyzed


Take a look into my eyes
I wanna hold you 'til you're paralyzed
Take a look into my eyes
I wanna hold you 'til you're paralyzed

Ah! Ah!
