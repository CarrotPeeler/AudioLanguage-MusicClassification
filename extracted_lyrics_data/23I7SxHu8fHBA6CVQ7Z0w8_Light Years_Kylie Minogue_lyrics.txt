14 ContributorsLight Years Lyrics
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one

Listen, can you hear the distant calling?
Far away, but we'll be with you soon
Rocketing to outer space in orbit
Take us to the pop stars on the moon

Ah, ah, ah, travel in light years
Ah, ah, ah, travel in light years

Have yourself a taste of foreign glamour
Speeding on our way to something new
Missing for a night but gone forever
The crew are here to take good care of you

Ah, ah, ah, travel in light years
Ah, ah, ah, travel in light years
Ah, ah, ah, travel in light years

Ah, ah, ah
Please, fasten your seat belts
My name is Kylie
I'll be your purser
The exits are located in the front and the rear of the craft
See Kylie Minogue LiveGet tickets as low as $31You might also like
Get up to get down at discoteca
Take a breath and take the plunge, my dear
Maybe things that you don't know are better
I'll take you in my capsule out of here

Ah, ah, ah, travel in light years
Ah, ah, ah, travel in light years
Ah, ah, ah, travel in light years
Ooh (Ah, ah, ah)
Ah (Ah, ah, ah)

(Ah, ah, ah) Thank you for flying KM Air
We hope you had a pleasant flight
(Ah, ah, ah) Please, fly with us again
(Ah, ah, ah)
(Ah, ah, ah)1Embed
