4 ContributorsTime Without End LyricsHope measuring time without end
You could be just like the sun
Beautiful like a dream
Innocent like a child
Heroic and brave
Like the kings and the warriors in the legends
Behold the depths of your innermost soul
A minotaur walking in endless despair
Mythical like a dream
Invisible like a soft breath of wind
But still in your fantasy
This will all be real
I'll show you who you are
I'll furnish you with a burning desireYou might also likeEmbed
