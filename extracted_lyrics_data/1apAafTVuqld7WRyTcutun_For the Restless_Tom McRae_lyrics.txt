2 ContributorsFor The Restless LyricsShe comes to me in dreams
A train wreck beauty queen
But I don't remember her
On a wall of white and blue
I wrote my name and thought of you
But you would not have known
Through a window of a car
A cigarette's a fallen star
A dream within a trail of sparks
And conversation turns to sleep
And I wait for you to speak
I'm waiting still
So for the restless
Not the peaceful sleeper
This song's for you
And for the faithless
Not the true believer
This song's for you
And I keep my secrets well
Move on and never tell
Some day they'll show
And you raised me to be cruel
You raised me like a bruise
I'm bleeding still
You might also likeSo for the restless
Not the peaceful sleeper
This song's for you
And for the faithless
Not the true believer
This song's for you
She comes to me in dreams
A train wreck beauty queen
Now I remember her
And everything you love will break
You're running out of things to make you
Feel alive
Alive
Alive
Alive
So for the restless
Not the peaceful sleeper
This song's for you
And for the faithless
Not the true believer
This song's for you
It's for you
It's for you
It's for you
It's just for youEmbed
