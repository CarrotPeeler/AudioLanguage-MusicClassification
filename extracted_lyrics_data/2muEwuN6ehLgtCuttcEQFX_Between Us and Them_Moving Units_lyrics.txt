2 ContributorsBetween Us & Them Lyrics
It's so clear now, I'm understanding
And the furniture, matches the ceiling
It was different than, you had expected
Will you pardon me, I wasn't elected

I know it's difficult, so
I will be patient
I guess we have to ask that
If it's okay, yeah
I'll make it easy for you, what a disaster
Maybe it's better off this way
Better off this way

It's a task, and then, when you complete it
Were you lonely when, I wasn't needed
Cause it's natural, to feel unfaithful
When you're going to, be anyway
Oh-oh-oh

I know it's difficult now, but you can try to
Was it worth all the fuss, 'cause, I feel so seedy
I'll make it easy for you, what a disaster
We couldn't go wrong, any faster

I never wanted anything
I never wanted anything
I never wanted anything
Uh-uh-uh

I never wanted
I never wanted
I never wanted
I never wanted
(Ooh-oh, ooh-oh) I never wanted
(Ooh-oh, ooh-oh) I never wanted
(Ooh-oh, ooh-oh) I never wanted
Uh-uh, uh-uh (uh-uh, uh-uh)2Embed
