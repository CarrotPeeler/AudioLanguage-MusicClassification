With a simple wave, her hand creates my universe
She spins and dances 'round the fire
Eyes search the open road, caught up in the sound
Of transmissions burning down the wire

We reach out for the sky
And we're never coming down, yeah

Live life in extreme
Better then any magazine could ever hope to describe, yeah
Ripped, we sweat this desert dance, baby, do your best
We're on our way to higher consciousness

We reach out for the sky
And we're never coming down
We reach out for the sky
We're never coming down

Keep reaching
Come on, keep reaching
(We're never coming down)
Come on, come on, keep reaching
Come on
(We're never coming down)
Keep reaching
Come on, come on, keep reaching
(We're never coming down)
Come on, come on, keep reaching
Come on, keep reaching
Reaching...
(Down)
(Down, ahh)
(Down, ahh)
(That's right)

Dance
(She spins and dances)
Come on
Come on, dance
(She spins and dances, she's caught up in the sound)
(She's caught up in the sound)

High on a million breaths of her
I surrender to the magic all around me

We reach out for the sky
And we're never coming down, yeah
We reach out for the sky
We're never coming down

Keep reaching
Come on, keep reaching
(We're never coming down)
Come on, come on, keep reaching
Come on
(We're never coming down)
Keep reaching
Come on, come on, keep reaching
(We're never coming down)
Come on, come on, keep reaching
Come on, keep reaching
Reaching...
Come on, come on

Come on, come on

Come on, come on, come on, baby, dance
Come on, come on, come on
Come on, baby, danceEmbed
