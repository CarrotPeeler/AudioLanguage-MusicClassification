3 ContributorsCoconut Grove Lyrics
It's really true that nothing matters
No mad, mad world and no mad hatters
And no one's pitching 'cause there ain't no batters
In Coconut Grove
Don't bar the door, there's no one coming
The ocean's roaring drown the drumming
Of any set of thoughts of city ways

The ocean breezes cool my mind
The sultry days of hers and mine
Just to do what we want to
Tonight we'll find a dune that's ours
And softly, she will speak of stars until sunup

It's all from having someone knowing
Just which way your head is blowing
It's always warm like in the morning
In Coconut Grove

The ocean breezes cool my mind
The sultry days of hers and mine
Just to do what we want to
Tonight we'll find a dune that's ours
And softly, she will speak of stars until sunup
You might also like
It's all from having someone knowing
Just which way your head is blowing
It's always warm like in the morning
In Coconut Grove

Oh, oh-oh-ohEmbed
