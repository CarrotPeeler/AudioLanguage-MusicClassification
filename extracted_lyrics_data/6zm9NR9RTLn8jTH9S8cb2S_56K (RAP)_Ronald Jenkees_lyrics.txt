2 Contributors56K (Rap) LyricsTop of the ’93, I woke up, drove to the store, and bought me a Dell PC
100 Megahertz Processor Speed:
“This is all you need,” he said, “trust me.”
I opened the door, soon as I came home;
Please hold my calls ‘cause I’m usin’ the phone
Dial-up Modem, Analog connection, 56K, 56K

I hooked up the Internet with my 56K modem speed and now
Meet all my peeps on the World Wide Web, that’s where they bein’ now
Hooked to the internet with my 56K modem speed and now
Meet all my peeps on the World Wide Web, that’s where they be
Movin’ right along into ’95
Thought to myself, “I’m gonna build a snazzy Web site”
Technically capable professional skills
I stick with my Dell PC, keepin’ it real
TCP/IP, Fiber optic Cords, with a few clicks I connect to the World
I connect to the Internet at lightning speeds;
I know a lot of people across the country

I hooked up the Internet with my 56K modem speed and now
Meet all my peeps on the World Wide Web, that’s where they bein’ now
Hooked to the internet with my 56K modem speed and now
Meet all my peeps on the World Wide Web, that’s where they be

Don’t try to get on my chat room and hate
Animated GIF files dancin' on my screen;
E-mail attachments with pics of me
I think about the future, of 2003;
I think about my PC depreciating on me
I don’t mind, it ain't nuttin’ to me:
56K is where it’ll be

I hooked up the Internet with my 56K modem speed and now
Meet all my peeps on the World Wide Web, that’s where they bein’ now
Hooked to the internet with my 56K modem speed and now
Meet all my peeps on the World Wide Web, that’s where they beEmbed
