Well, the blues got pregnant
And they named the baby Rock 'n' Roll

Well, the blues had a baby
And they named the baby Rock 'n' Roll
B. B. King said, "You know the blues got soul"

Well, then the blues had a baby
And they named the baby Rock 'n' Roll
Blind Lemon said, "You know the blues got soul"
His daddy said, "You know the blues got soul"
Well, the blues had a baby
And they named it Rock 'n' Roll
