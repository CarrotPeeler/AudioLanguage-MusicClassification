2 ContributorsWhatever You Want Babe LyricsIf you wanna walk out the door
You don't need a key
If you don't wanna come by no more
I'll set you free
Whatever you want babe
Whatever you need
Just as long as you know babe
What you're doin' to me
What you're doin' to me
If you wanna say it's a day
I won't disagree
I would never stand in your way
That wouldn't be me
Whatever you want babe
Whatever you need
Just as long as you know babe
What it's doin' to me
What it's doin' to me
I would never tie you down
You've always been free to leave
If you wanna make it goobye
That's o.k. with me
Got so tired of asking you why
I'll just let it be
You might also likeWhatever you want babe
Whatever you need
Just as long as you know babe
What it's doin' to me
And if I try to find a reason
For all the things I do
Would you try to understand , the way I am
And how I care for you
Would you give me your undivided attention
And the benefit of your doubt?
Ooh!, ooh!
(Charlton)
