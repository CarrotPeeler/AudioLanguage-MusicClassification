To show my faith
To try and lose my blues
Something that takes its place
Chorus
I don’t care about the moon
And the stars above
It ain’t something in my pocket
And the chance of love
The chance of love
I have been out and long the hard wire
Trying to make it babe
We all need to get lucky
And a chance to come my way
Chorus
So i don’t care about the moon
And the stars way above

And the chance of love
The chance of love
Dress me up in pretty clothes
Let everybody see

The chance of love
And I am praying for an angel
Yeah I am looking for a …
Nobody wants to give up
Everybody wants to play
Chorus
So i don’t care about the moon
And the stars way above
Got something in my pocket
And the chance of love
The chance of love
The chance of love
The chance of love
The chance of loveYou might also like1Embed
