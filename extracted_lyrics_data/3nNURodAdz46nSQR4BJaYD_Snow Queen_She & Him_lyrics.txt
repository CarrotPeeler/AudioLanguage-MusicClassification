4 ContributorsSnow Queen LyricsWell, I would rather do a lot of despicable things
Than sit around and wait
Sit around and wait for the telephone to ring
Why do you wait?
What are you waiting for?
Stop looking out the window
Looking out the window
And get out your front door
I'm so cold, but I'm nice
Beneath
The ice
So deep
Never doing as I'm told
And it's cold outside
But I think you'll get used to it, darling
And it's dark out there
But isn't scary fun?
I'm the cold, I'm the snow
Make it hurt until you go
I'm the dark, I'm the night
I would bark but never bite
