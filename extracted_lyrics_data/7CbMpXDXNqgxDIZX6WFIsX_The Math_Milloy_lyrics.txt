3 ContributorsDO THE MATH! Lyrics
Bro, okay, okay, it goes—
What the fuck do you know?
What the fuck do I think I know?
What the fuck do you know?
What the fuck do I think I—

Everybody told me that opposites attract
Every time I looked at you, I thought I felt that
Lately you been feeling distant, we agree on nothing
Fighting all the time, I can even feel it when we fucking
You and I promised each other we would last for years
But it’s been three months and I wish I could disappear
Was it something that I did? Or something that I didn’t?
Or something I missed reading the fine print?
I wish that it was something I said
But it’s natural for us, we could talk it out
But stopping would be tough

My magnet is pushing you away
Opposite sides of this horrible love
We’re only together for a place to stay
But that’s just not enough
You might also like
Do the math, we're fucking opposites
Don't hit me back, I don't have time for shit
Wrong fucking path, you might be missed
If you don't do the math, I'll be fucking pissed

Wait, fuck, that's stupid, haha
Before I was here, I fucked your mom
Old girl's a ticking time-bomb, bahaha

Øddity, shit's really odd (Okay)
Someone please link the stable relationship mod (Boo)
In seriousness, I thought we were meant to be
But you turned out to be an opposite, an enemy
Shit isn't working, can't even stay friends, I see
Bestie, we need to actually think this through
Or in a second, we'll be saying, "It's not me, it's you!" (Wait)
Do the math, fucking algebra
Unless you want me to be a human tarantula (What?)

My magnet is pushing you away
Opposite sides of this horrible love
We’re only together for a place to stay
But that’s just not enough
Do the math, we're fucking opposites
Don't hit me back, I don't have time for shit
Wrong fucking path, you might be missed
If you don't do the math, I'll be fucking pissed

Do the math, please don't hit me back
We took the wrong fucking path
If you don't do the math, I'll be fucking pissed
We're fucking opposites, you might be missed

Do the math, we're fucking opposites
Don't hit me back, I don't have time for shit
Wrong fucking path, you might be missed
If you don't do the math, I'll be fucking pissed
