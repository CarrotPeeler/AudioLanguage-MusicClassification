1 ContributorBrain Dead LyricsWe are brain dead
We march without no head
Product of the brainless, product of the dumb
Radiation roaches got you on the run
Soldiers for the DNA
Dissidents are put away
Dragged off in the dead of night
Disappear without a sight
For global peace is what we pray
As long as things are done our way
Disagree or acting rude
We will chop you up for food
Our agenda is your end
Until then we'll be your friend
Act not thinking is our tool
Stand up for the golden rule
Stab your friends in the back
Rule the world load the pack
Human flesh is what we crave
Nothing wasted in the graveYou might also likeEmbed
