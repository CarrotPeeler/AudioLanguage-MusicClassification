2 ContributorsDead Wrong LyricsShe's wearin' her mama's shoes
And cryin' like a baby
Standin' on the edge screamin'
Somebody save me
She called her daddy from a pay phone
He says you're livin' in sin
You can come back home
But you can't come in
And it's wrong
It's just wrong
It's all wrong
He's a house full of people
Whether he's drinkin' or not
But she's gotta keep tryin'
'Cause he's all she's got
She's back on the phone
With another roll of dimes
'Cause it's hard not to argue
With a fool sometimes
And it's wrong
It's just wrong
It's all wrong
You might also likeWith an itchy trigger finger
And a heart full of grief
A woman like that puts out a lotta heat
And the flame burns hotter
On the long ride home
Where a sad little man waits all alone
And it's wrong
It's just wrong
It's all wrong
She was like an apparition
Coming through the door
Shot her daddy dead
On the living room floor
She threw down the gun and began to cry
Said "my daddy never loved me and
I don't know why"
And it's wrong
It's just wrong
It's all wrongEmbed
