12 ContributorsWarbrain Lyrics
Thoughts are the shadows of feelings
Always darker, emptier, and simpler
I don't care if they're fake or real
I just thank them for showing up at all
I have black periods. Who does not?
But they are not a part of me;
They are not a part of illness, but a part of my being
What am I saying?
I have the courage to have them
Four o' clock in the morning. This sucks."

I can't go on
You set my head too heavy
I need that song
Those trusty chords could pull me through
And early on
They saw the warning signs and symptoms all day long
We'd sit and dream of better days

When we'd hit the ground running on empty
Stories we've been told
And all those nights we spent together
Never felt this fucking cold
When we let the car run in the driveway
Kiss you one last time
Before we brought the horses in before
The storm of '59, of '59, of '59
You might also like
I can't go on
These limbs have grown too heavy
I need that song
A night on earth could pull me through
And early on
They saw the warning signs and symptoms all day long
Wonder how far from here we'll fall

Before we hit the ground running on empty
Stories we've been told
And those nights we spent together
Never felt this fucking cold
When we let the car run in the driveway
Kiss you one last time
Before we brought the horses in before
The storm of '59, of '59, of '59, of '59, of '59Embed
