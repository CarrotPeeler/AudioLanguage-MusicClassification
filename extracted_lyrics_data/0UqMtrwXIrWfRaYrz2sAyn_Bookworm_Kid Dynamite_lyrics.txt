2 ContributorsBookworm LyricsIt plagued me, Like a cancer
If you asked me what it meant
I couldn't answer...
'Cause I sit here... Alone and searchin'...
Man! I gotta stop complainin'!
(Chorus)
It's been so long
I don't know what to say to you
The feeling's gone
I remember once upon a time
I wouldn't have cared...
Just what I shared with you
But now I'm hiding!
She said she wanted to know me
Like a book
I was outta there fast
Remembering all the time... That it took
To get over the source of all the...
Times that... I felt dead
There's chapters in this book that I haven't even read yet!
(Chorus)
I've been lucky
To have someone who cared for me
I'm sorry, 'cause
When you got too close I'd run away
Na-na-na-na...
The scars are almost covered up
And I'm rising!
You might also likeBut there's just one thing that I gotta say to you...
RIGHT!
I don't regret the time we spent
But I do regret the day we met
'Cause I've learned my lesson
And I've learned it well
Now there's no more secrets for you to tell
For all it's worth...
For all it's worth...!
For all it's worth...
For all... For all it's worth!
I'm still... dreaming... feeling without you!Embed
