My, my, my I'm loving what you do to me
You got a motor like a brand new car
So start it up for me
Yes, yes, yes something in your sexy ways
Yes, yes, yes gonna love you all of my days
You got a motor like a brand new car
So start it up for me
Start it up, start it up you make me feel like romancin'
Start it up, start it up you make me feel like dancin'
You got a motor like a brand new car
So start it up for me
The way you move such a finely tuned machine mmm
Such a solid groove the best I've ever seen
You got a motor like a brand new car
So start it up for me
The way you move such a finely tuned machine yes
Such a solid groove the best I've ever seen
