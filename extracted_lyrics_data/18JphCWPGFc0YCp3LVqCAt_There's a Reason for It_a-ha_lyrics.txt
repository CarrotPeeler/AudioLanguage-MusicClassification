4 ContributorsThereâ€™s a Reason for It LyricsDon't know how it got away from me
Don't know how I let things go, you see
Don't know why it took a sudden turn
Didn't seem to be a big concern
And everything is all too much
Hot and bothered, you're cool to the touch
And everyone is worlds apart
It must have been this way right from the start
When there's nothing here to save the day
Then we have to say
There's a reason for it
When there's nothing left for us to do
You're left without a clue
There's a reason for it
Don't know how it got away from me
Don't know how I let things go, you see
Don't know why it took a sudden turn
Didn't seem to be a big concern
And everyone is all too well
All well-adjusted people, can't you tell?
And everything is all too fast
Just add water, nothing's built to last

Time and time again
There's a reason for it
When your name's the butt of every joke
Just about to croak
There's a reason for it
And everyone is worlds apart
It must have been this way right from the start
When there's nothing here to save the day
Then we have to say
There's a reason for it
When there's nothing left for us to do
You're left without a clue
There's a reason for it
When there's nothing here to save the day
Then we have to say
There's a reason for it
When there's nothing here to save the day
Then we have to say
There's a reason for it
There's a reason for it
There's a reason for it
