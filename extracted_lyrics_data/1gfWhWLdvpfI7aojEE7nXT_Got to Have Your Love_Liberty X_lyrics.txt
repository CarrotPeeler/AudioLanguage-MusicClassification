3 ContributorsGot To Have Your Love Lyrics
Every time I close my eyes
I can clearly see the image of your smile
Shine through my darkest dreams
I never thought I'd find myself this close
This close, to you my dear
Tell me what it means
(Got to have your love)

I can feel your sweet caress
Wash away all the loneliness that I once felt
Inside my heart, oh yeah
Boy, if you could read my mind
I'm sure that you could find
What you've been searching for
What you've been searching for

Bring me from dismay, there's so much to share
If you surrender to me, woah, yeah
Whisper in my ears words I long to hear
Ooh yeah

Gotta find a way to get into your heart
Boy, I got to have your love
Gotta find a way to get into your heart
You know, you know, you know I need your love
Gotta find a way to get into your heart
Boy, I got to have your love
Gotta find a way to get into your heart
You know, you know, you know I need your love, oh-woah
Mm, yeah
You might also like
Listen up, whoo!
I got to have your love
It's like this

You're like an angel in disguise
I feel like I'm in heaven when you walk my way
You're such a mystery (such a mystery)
Butterflies I feel inside must be (must be), must be (must be)
A sign of love, no one can disagree

My desire for your love is like a new horizon
Only lovers see, like you and I, I
The signal that will be the start to synchronize our hearts
I love you 'till my dyin' day, until my dyin' day

Bring me from dismay, there's so much to share
If you surrender to me (to me), to me (to me), to me
Whisper in my ears (oh yeah) words I long to hear
Oh-woah-woah-woah

Gotta find a way to get into your heart
Boy, I got to have your love
Gotta find a way to get into your heart (woah)
You know, you know, you know I need your love
Gotta find a way to get into your heart
Boy, I got to have your love
Gotta find a way to get into your heart (yeah, yeah)
Gotta find a way to get into your heart
Boy, I got to have
Gotta find a way to get into your heart
You know I need your love
Gotta find a way to get into your heart
Boy, I got to have your love
Gotta find a way to get into your heart
You know, you know I need your love
Gotta find a way to get into your heart
Boy, I got to have your love
Gotta find a way to get into your heart
You know, you know I need your love
Gotta find a way to get into your heart
Boy, I got to have your love
Gotta find a way to get into your heartEmbed
