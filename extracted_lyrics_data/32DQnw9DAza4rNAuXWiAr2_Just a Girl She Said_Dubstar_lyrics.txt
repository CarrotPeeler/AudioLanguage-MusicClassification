It's all right, I'm just a girl, she said
Talk down to me and take me to bed
I don't feel, I don't think
And I don't really matter at all
Kiss me in darkness and turn out the light
Pretend you're with someone else tonight
You don't feel, you don't think
And I don't really understand why

I'm a person who speaks, I'm a person who thinks
But you hope I'll forget 'cause you ply me with drinks
And you cannot buy me and you cannot use me
But I know that you want to try

It's all right, I'm just a girl, she said
You can't buy me and take me to bed
'Cause I think, 'cause I feel
And you don't really matter at all

I'm a person who speaks, I'm a person who thinks
But you hope I'll forget 'cause you ply me with drinks
And you cannot buy me and you cannot use me
But I know that you want to try
You might also like
Don't look in my eyes, you may be surprised
To find I have answers to your questions why
As I have no feelings or thoughts of my own
But I know that you want to try

It's all right, I'm just a girl, she said
Talk down to me and take me to bed
I don't feel, I don't think
And I don't really matter at all

I'm a person who speaks, I'm a person who thinks
But you hope I'll forget 'cause you ply me with drinks
And you cannot buy me and you cannot use me
But I know that you want to try

(Just a girl she said)
(Just a girl she said)
I know that you want to try
(Just a girl she said)
(Just a girl she said)
I know that you want to try
(Just a girl she said)
(Just a girl she said)
(Just a girl she said)
(Just a girl she said)
I know that you want to try
(Just a girl)
(Just a girl she said)
(Just a girl)
(Just a girl she said)Embed
