1 ContributorCivilians Lyrics
Dear civilians, I hope this reaches you well
The message that I spit was forbidden for me to tell
Hopefully you listen to every syllable written
Resentment over dissension is all of our death knell
The dark side of existence is learning to coexist
Our future holds destruction as soon as we mold a fist
Cliched, full of rage, infinitely incensed
Not the ones that are raised from every urge to resist
So… Dear Civilians, I really need you to get it
Humanity is counting on every one of us living today
Not civilians of the countries, but the planet we inhabit
It’s a fact that we typically just look at it through the former lens
I know, we’re all different
But set all that aside as I provide us with a mission
To gather ‘round and rise, all eyes upon the vision
Of deleting every system holding us in mental prisons
Locked down! Free my brothers in arms. Free my mothers and aunts
Free my sisters of all creeds and colors
It’s on all of us, never just on one
Not won ‘til we seek peace and not funds
Not done. I speak my piece and feed peace of mind
To meek, feeble, weak and blind sons (meek, feeble, weak and blind sons)
Of a world that’s dying to buy guns
And bullets to fight anyone living to find crumbs (fight anyone living to find crumbs)
Day-to-day the struggle is Fight Club
‘Cause you can’t talk about it with any unlike us
And when you try they tell you to bite dust
But the effort is respected and helps to ignite love

Dear civilians (I want everyone to arise)
Dear civilians (Open your eyes, read between the lines and find)
I said, civility is lost when we lose trust
Drop the sword and opt to soar, it’s on us
Civilians (Don’t pay attention to the lies)
My dear civilians (Revolution isn’t always televised)
You know civility is key to unify all we see
The precedent is set, you and I are everything
We’re civilians (I want everyone to arise)
Dear civilians (Open your eyes, read between the lines)
I said, civility is lost when we lose trust
Drop the sword and opt to soar, it’s on us
Civilians (Don’t pay attention to the lies)
My dear civilians (Revolution isn’t always televised)
You know civility is key to unify all we see
The precedent is set, you and I are everything
We’re...

Dear civilians of a criminal world
Where slow and steady wins the race but the hare gets the girl
Where… all the hope we ever needed was hurled
Into the sea and disbelief is how we seep into churls
‘Cause we don’t… ever wanna see the truth in all the mystery
What they're keeping from us might just be the vital missing piece
That’d bring us all together in harmony like we’re meant to be
Mentally I’m astonished at all this but look at history
It’s… been going on for a long time
Divide individuals, then you conquer their mind
Preside over the residents, whether fuhrer or president
Iron-fist for the betterment, better yet, for the benefit of self
The powerful remain that way
And the people: left without a word or say
In what takes place, even though it regards ‘em
Treat ‘em brutal regardless of whatever they call ‘em
A problem
I wanna travel back in time to see just how it was
But I’d prolly end up on a ship and sold like a drug
To a thug in white suit, led to my demise
Hands up to the skies yelling, “FREEDOM IS A LIE”
Disguised as equality that we have never known
They say it all for show, but they gon’ notice fo’sho
The people hold a power that’s comparable to the Gods
Our survival’s no facade and our lives are not a fraud
Dear civilians (I want everyone to arise)
Dear civilians (Open your eyes, read between the lines and find)
I said, civility is lost when we lose trust
Drop the sword and opt to soar, it’s on us
Civilians (Don’t pay attention to the lies)
My dear civilians (Revolution isn’t always televised)
You know civility is key to unify all we see
The precedent is set, you and I are everything
We’re civilians (I want everyone to arise)
Dear civilians (Open your eyes, read between the lines)
I said, civility is lost when we lose trust
Drop the sword and opt to soar, it’s on us
Civilians (Don’t pay attention to the lies)
My dear civilians (Revolution isn’t always televised)
You know civility is key to unify all we see
The precedent is set, you and I are everything
We’re...

We were born to be something other than pawns
We gotta strive for more than throwing our paws
Calm and collected, the issues that we’re correcting
We ain’t cause but every struggle is ours
We were born to be something other than pawns
We gotta strive for more than throwing our paws
Calm and collected, the issues that we’re correcting
We ain’t cause but every struggle is ours
The future lies in the palms of us all
Free will, we will survive their downfall
Combine and rise for every time they lied
One of us died or tried crying for help and lines stalled
But, then again, I guess it’s cold in the city
I’ll never win until I’m bold but, really
I never told ‘em how much I would truly owe ‘em
Regardless I’m getting older and frigidness on my shoulder is building
Dear civilians (I want everyone to arise)
Dear civilians (Open your eyes, read between the lines and find)
I said, civility is lost when we lose trust
Drop the sword and opt to soar, it’s on us
Civilians (Don’t pay attention to the lies)
My dear civilians (Revolution isn’t always televised)
You know civility is key to unify all we see
The precedent is set, you and I are everything
We’re civilians (I want everyone to arise)
Dear civilians (Open your eyes, read between the lines)
I said, civility is lost when we lose trust
Drop the sword and opt to soar, it’s on us
Civilians (Don’t pay attention to the lies)
My dear civilians (Revolution isn’t always televised)
You know civility is key to unify all we see
The precedent is set, you and I are everything
We’re...

Civility is key to unify all we see
The precedent is set, you and I are everything
We’re civiliansEmbed
