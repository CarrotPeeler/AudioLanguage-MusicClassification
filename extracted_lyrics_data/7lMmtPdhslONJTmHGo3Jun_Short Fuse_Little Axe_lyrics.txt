1 ContributorIntro LyricsIts ur homeboy joat in the house hell yeah
L me  holla at ma city
She’s been through hell and back for so many times
Let me paint the town red ha ha
Got AG on the beat here we ‘bout to get crackin’ up in this motherfucker

I don’t what it is but i know i suppose to
This be a introduction
Hi the name is joat
I live to seduce u boo ay
Joat’s out here with a bag full of ideas ma niyyas
Ain't here to catch case but got a thang for the trouble u could call it Mania
Bye dear
Time to speak to them hustlers doin’ their thang
Puttin’ it to work even gangbang
For them chang hangs and then bang bang
Joat says hi to them politicians
All they do is fuck up and screwing up the mission
Shit’s hit the fan need supervision feels like lesion crawl through ur skin to hell with remission
Let’s move on and holla at them youngsters
Try to make it out here and not be a monster
I know u say that ain't goin’ to happen
I know that u think im just yap yap yappin’
But naw man all good just here rappin’ tellin’ ma story they be cheerin’  they be clappin’
Im walkin’ on the edge while these suckers be nappin’
Been tryin’ to keep it real for tooooo many long
Seen and done shit
Thought i was right man but too damn wrong
Got a lot to say but a damn short fuse
A little short tempered no excuse
Last but not least let me represent the city
I’ve felt both good here as well as fuckin’  shitty
Its a big one with a whole fuckin’ story
This ma hood man my territory
T E H R A N in the house
The chique gilrs and the bums with the laus
Every litte corner
Every little store
Every street behind every door
Children
Parents are tryin’ to adapt
This shit is fucked up
All out attack YeeaaahYou might also likeEmbed
