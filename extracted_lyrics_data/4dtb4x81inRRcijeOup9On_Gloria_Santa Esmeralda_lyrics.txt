You know she come around
She's about five feet four
From her head to the ground
You know she come around here
Just about midnight
She make me feel so good
She make me feel all right
And her name is G-L-O-R-I-...
G-L-O-R-I-A

You know she come around here
Just about midnight
She makes me feel so good
She makes me feel all right
You know she'll walkin' down my street
And then she's a-a-knockin' on my door
And then she come into my room
And then she make me feel all right
