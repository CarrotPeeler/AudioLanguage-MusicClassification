Lazin' on the beach all day
Lazin' on
Lazin' on the beach all day
I said whoa! I know you're gonna like it, like it, like it, like it (Lazin' on, lazin' on the beach all day)
Yeah, you bet you're gonna love it, love it (Lazin' on, lazin' on the beach)
Well make a reservation
Gotta fly to the sun
Take a vacation
Yeah your holiday has just begun
Suntan lotion
Floatin' on a heat wave
With the deep blue ocean
90 degrees in the shade
I tell you whoa, I know you're gonna like it
Lazin' on the beach all day
Yeah you bet you're gonna love it
'Cause it's a holi-holi-holiday
Okay now!
Lazin' by the poolside
With an ice cool beer
Dancin' in the moonlight
Yeah I bet you're wishing you were here
Coconut and bamboo
BBQ with ice-cream
With the night-light sky blue
You'll never ever wanna leave
You might also likeI tell you whoa, I know you're gonna like it
Lazin' on the beach all day
Yeah you bet you're gonna love it
'Cause it's a holi-holi-holiday
(Lazin'!)
Lazin' on
Lazin' on the beach
I tell you whoa, I know you're gonna like it
Lazin' on the beach all day
Yeah you bet you're gonna love it
'Cause it's a holi-holi-holiday
Okay let's go!
I said whoa, I know you're gonna like it, like it, like it, like it (Lazin' on, lazin' on the beach all day)
Yeah you bet you're gonna love it, love it, love it, love it (Lazin' on, lazin' on the beach all day)
I said whoa, I know you're gonna like it, like it, like it, like it (Lazin' on, lazin' on the beach all day)
Yeah you bet you're gonna love it, love it, love it (Lazin' on, lazin' on the beach all day)
'Cause it's a holi-holi-holiday
I keep telling you whoa, I know you're gonna like it!
On the beach!
Lazin' on the beach, lazin' on the beach all day
Yeah you bet you're gonna love it (You can't beat it)
'Cause it's a holi-holi-holiday (No, no, no)
I keep telling you whoa, I know you're gonna like it
