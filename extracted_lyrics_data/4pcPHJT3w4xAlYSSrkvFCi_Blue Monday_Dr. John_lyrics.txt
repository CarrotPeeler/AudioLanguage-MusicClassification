1 ContributorBlue Monday LyricsBlue Monday, how I hate Blue Monday
Got to work like a slave all day
Here come Tuesday, oh, hard Tuesday
Got no time, got no time to play
Here come Wednesday, I'm beat to my socks
My , got to tell her that I'm out
But Thursday is a hard workin' day
Friday, I get my pay
Saturday mornin', Saturday mornin'
All my tiredness have gone away
Got my money and my honey
And I'm out on the stand to play
Sunday mornin' my head is bad
But it's worth it for the time I had
But I've got to get my rest
'Cause Monday is a mess
Saturday mornin', Saturday mornin'
All my tiredness have gone away
Got my money and my honey
And I'm out on the stand to play
Sunday mornin' my head is bad
But it's worth it for the time I had
But I've got to get my rest
'Cause Monday is a messYou might also likeEmbed
