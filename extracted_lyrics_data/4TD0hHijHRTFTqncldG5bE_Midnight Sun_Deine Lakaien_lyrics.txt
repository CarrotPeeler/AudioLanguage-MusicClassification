1 ContributorMidnight Sun LyricsMy life on straight avenue
And all my doings
Were in a rut
All I had well defined
Nightflights without wanting to
To where the lawn remains uncut
No more that
Leave behind
I'm gettin paranoid
I feel a gaping void
I have to fill this
Without idea of bliss
I have to break through
These barriers
I have to break through
I have to break through
Midnight sun burn me to death
Endless love bittersweet taste
Midnight sun burn me to death
Endless love bittersweet taste
Who caused all this longing for
I try to reach this unknown land
Don't know what, far away
Where I've never never been before
I try to run and swim across
For what luck
Who can say
You might also likeI am getting paranoid
I feel a gaping void
I have to fill this
Without idea of bliss
I have to break through these barriers
I have to break through
I have to break through
Midnight sun burn me to death
Endless love bittersweet taste
Midnight sun burn me to death
Endless love bittersweet taste
I want to touch your light
Feel it deep inside
Hear me singing tonight
Hold you tight
I want to touch your light
Feel it deep inside
Hear me singing tonight
My wish to hold you tight
I am getting paranoid
I feel a gaping void
I have to fill this
Without idea of bliss
I have to break through these barriers
I have to break through
I have to break through
Midnight sun burn me to death
Endless love bittersweet taste
Midnight sun burn me to death
Endless love bittersweet taste
Midnight sun burn me...Embed
