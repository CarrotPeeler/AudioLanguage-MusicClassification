1 ContributorSweet Talker LyricsYou're a sweet talker, baby
When I'm around
You've run out of luck
And lost this old clown
I am so tired of hearing
What you're gonna be
But I never heard you
Tell me, baby, you're free
No, I never heard you
Tell me, baby, you're free
I remember when you
Came into my life
You pulled out you gun
And shot me on site
Now you're wrapped up in Maya
Blowin' in the breeze
But I never heard you
Tell me, baby, you're free
No, I never heard you
Tell me, baby, you're free
I'm sorry to hear that
You're back on the street
But you never gave love to
Nobody you'd meet
Now the Master is calling
Just come down and see
But I never heard you
Tell me, baby, you're free
No, I never heard you
Tell me, baby, you're freeYou might also likeEmbed
