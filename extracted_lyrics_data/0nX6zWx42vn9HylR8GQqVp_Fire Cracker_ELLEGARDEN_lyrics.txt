1 ContributorFire Cracker LyricsNow I finally understand
We're all here to play an endless game
And winning is just bad as losing
Am I sick
Not anymore
How could I be tonight
To find it floating in my static dream
Just sing it Sing it
Even though I've never said the words
Don't fake it no more
To find it floating in your static dream
Just sing it Sing it
Even though I've never said the words
I feel right now
Now I've got this far anyway
And I've finally turned to my last page
These countless memories still holding me back
Am I sick
Not anymore
How could I be tonight
To find it floating in my static dream
Just sing it Sing it
Even though I've never said the words
Don't fake it no more
To find it floating in your static dream
Just sing it Sing it
Even though I've never said the words
I feel right now
You might also likeThe tired song of summer that I used to sing
And you found me somehow good
And it's so much fun to be with you
You can't imagine how I was dying just to talk to you
We can leave it as it is
We can be as one as well
To find it floating in my static dream
Just sing it Sing it
Even though I've never said the words
Don't fake it no more
To find it floating in your static dream
Just sing it Sing it
Even though I've never said the words
I feel right nowEmbed
