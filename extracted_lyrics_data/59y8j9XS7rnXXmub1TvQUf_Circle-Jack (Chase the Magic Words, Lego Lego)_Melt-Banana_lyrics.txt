5 ContributorsCircle-Jack (Chase the Magic Words, Lego Lego) LyricsTake bound shift, found in a shaft
More pegs wash your stingy tag
Baggy lung
To get secrets, all must refer all past sinners
I take a look at fifth prick in the pith
More brags wait for buggy tongue
Watch your head!
To meet outlets all must prefer all lost colors
And all say
Let go, let go, let go, let me say
Let go, let go, let go, snow lay knee-deep
Let go, let go, let go, let me say
His kneecaps got cracks about to give way
Chase it!
Chase it!
Chase it!
Helix tells me secrets
"Here's fuse, free speed"
Helix tells me secrets
"Here's fuse, free speed"
He let me cheat!

More pigs wash your tidy lie
Watch now!
To get secrets, you must make up whole trash glitter
And all say
Let go, let go, let go, let me say
Let go, let go, let go, snow lay knee-deep
Let go, let go, let go, let me say
His kneecaps got cracks about to end
Chase it!
Chase it!
Chase it!
Last fellow, hide in a ditch
Patch bewitch to switch
I catch you later
Last fellow, hide in a ditch
Patch bewitch to switch
I catch you later
Last fellow, die in a ditch
Next clutch to twitch
Such a saver
Last fellow, die in a ditch
Next clutch to twitch
Hide in shelter
Lego, Lego, Lego, Lego
Halo covers ego, wipeout!
Chase it!
Chase it!
Chase it!
