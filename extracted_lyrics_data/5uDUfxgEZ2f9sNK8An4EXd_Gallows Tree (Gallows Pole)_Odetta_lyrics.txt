Slack it for awhile
Think I see my father coming
Riding many a mile
Papa did you bring me silver?
Papa did you bring me gold?
Did you come to see me hanging by the gallows pole?
Well, I couldn't bring no silver
Didn't bring no gold
I've come to see you hang by the gallows pole
Hangman, hangman slack your rope
Slack it for awhile
Think I see my mother coming
Riding many a mile
Riding many a mile
Well, Mama did you bring me silver?
Mama did you bring me gold?
Did you come to see me hang by the gallows pole?
I didn't bring no silver
Didn't bring no gold
I've come to see you hanging by the gallows pole
By the gallows pole - oh God!

Think I see my sweetheart coming
Riding many a mile
Riding many a mile - oh God!
Riding many a mile
Honey did you bring me silver?
Honey did you bring me gold?
Did you come to see me hang by the gallows pole?
Hanging by the gallows pole?
I brought you silver
Brought you a little gold
Didn't come to see you hanging
By the gallows pole
