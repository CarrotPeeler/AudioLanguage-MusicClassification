Psychedelic sound in that 2k era
Bet the style that I found make your mood way better
Never ever dumbin’ down what did Lupe tell ya
Young kid, skin thicker than the Luke Cage fella
You snooze: you’re zooked, cuz that dude stay clever
Cutie gimme snu snu, make that pum pum wetter
Yeah my chick Arabic, tell my booboo yala
Hit the track, choo choo if you use your melon
Choose your weapon: energy sword, nobody feeling that
What you use your energy for when you just stealing that?
Felony arrest for these flows, got out and beat the rap
They tellin’ me melody’s old, I’m ‘bout to bring em back
Word is bond like Jane Fonda with apes
I ain’t following fakes, I pay homage to greats
Shootin’ for the stars I may fall on my face
But what if I loop Mars then find solace in space, boy?

I came this far on my two feet
I took my Ls and my dubs
I’m twisting problems in a loose leaf
Backwoods, inhaling that love
Feeling that buzz static shockin’
Magic act, dem panties droppin’
Cold rhymes and a heavenly flow
Showtime and I’m ready to go go go
You might also like
Are you workin’ for a living or you living to work?
I’ve been working toward a vision gettin’ women to twerk
Many artists on a mission with a similar curse
But are you really fully driven or you shiftin’ reverse, nigga?
No brainer I’m paving my own lane
Givin’ em straight gas, that diesel or propane
Conducting great tracks, they hitchin’ my soul train
Saying you hate Haf, ain’t really my own name
Haf n’ haf like the cream, that’s a double meaning
French vanilla, choc deluxe or that butter pecan
I been runnin’ with my team every other weekend
We been fuckin’ up the scene with this public speakin’
When I step into a cypher bet it pop off
Bet you step into a cypher catchin’ lockjaw
Hella pressure for a writer when you top notch
But I’m a blessing and a titan in the Dot Dot

I came this far on my two feet
I took my Ls and my dubs
I’m twisting problems in a loose leaf
Backwoods, inhaling that love
Feeling that buzz static shockin’
Magic act, dem panties droppin’
Cold rhymes and a heavenly flow
Showtime and I’m ready to go go go

I’m a tall cup of water to the old farmer’s daughter
Got her wet like a sauna, gimme neck like a llama
Same nigga, new drip, momma probably proud of me
Poppin’ like a collard green, she gon’ pop up on the scene
Don’t trip, baby don’t trip
I could see you shining like the diamond that you is
Baby got me shining like the diamonds on my wrist
Don’t forget, I’ll remind you who I is... MELO
Feelin’ groovy and shroomy, ima dog like Scooby
We don’t go to the movies, we downtown making movies
Riding ‘round in a hoopti, car tunes got you feelin’ looney
Know that you wish that you knew me before you knew ‘bout the new me
Too bad so sad, ain't no going back
Its music to my ears, hearing you got waxed
Name got one L and I smoke that, know that
My dub still on the way, you better know that

I came this far on my two feet
I took my Ls and my dubs
I’m twisting problems in a loose leaf
Backwoods, inhaling that love
Feeling that buzz static shockin’
Magic act, dem panties droppin’
Cold rhymes and a heavenly flow
Showtime and I’m ready to goEmbed
