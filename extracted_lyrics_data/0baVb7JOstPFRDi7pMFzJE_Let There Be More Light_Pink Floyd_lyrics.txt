Far, far, far, far away, way
People heard him say, say
I will find a way, way
There will come a day, day
Something will be done

Then at last, the mighty ship
Descending on a point of flame
Made contact with the human race at Mildenhall

Now, now, now
Is the time, time, time
To be, be, be aware

Carterâ€™s father saw him there
And knew the road revealed to him
The living soul of Hereward the Wake

Oh, my
Something in my eye, eye
Something in the sky, sky
Waiting there for me
You might also like
The outer lock rolled slowly back
The service men were heard to sigh
For there revealed in glowing robes was Lucy in the sky

Oh, oh
Did you ever know, know
Never ever will they
I can't say

Summoning his cosmic powers
And glowing slightly from his toes
His psychic emanations flowed
