No moment's better than this
Of all the things I had ever known
Nothing prepared me for your kiss
If we fly, if we fly, if we fly into this song
Of all the things I needed, baby
You were my cherished one
A little bird told me that you can't find your way home
A little bird has shown me that you can't run away from love
Darkness falls upon the city
Like the ocean falls upon the sand
Waves of sorrow leave me breathless
Can you love this broken man
If I try, if I try, if I try to love again
I wake up every morning
Not sure of where I stand
A little bird told me that you can't find your way home
A little bird has shown me that you can't run away from love
Open wide my feelings
And tear me down until I break, yes
Show me what the real is
Guaranteed to seal my faint
You might also likeIf I cry, if I cry, if I cry when you'll be gone, oh
Help me about my sadness
Tell me I'm the only one
Hold me, hold me, hold me, angel
Hold me, hold me, hold me, angel
Love was only given when you feel it in your heart
I knew it when you kissed my body
Love in every part
Of all the things I had found in life
No moment's better than this
Of all the things I had ever known
Nothing prepared me for your kiss
If we fly, if we fly, if we fly into this song
Of all the things I needed, baby
You were my cherished one
A little bird told me that you can't find your way home
A little bird has shown me that you can't run away from loveEmbed
