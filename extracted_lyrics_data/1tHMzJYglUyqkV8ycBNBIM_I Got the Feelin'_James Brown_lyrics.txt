17 ContributorsI Got the Feelinâ€™ Lyrics
Uh huh huh huh
I got the feelin'!
Baby, baby
I got the feelin'!

You don't know what you do to me
Leave my heart heavy, down in misery

Hey, yeah, alright
Hey, hey, ow! Good lord

I got the feelin', now
Alright

Baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby
I got the feelin', baby
You might also like
Baby, sometimes I'm up, sometimes I'm down
My heart, I'm around the town
I'm level with the ground, baby
I said level with the ground

Well baby, you treat me
You treat me bad
No, no, I know no
You don't mean it now

Sometimes I roam
But, I'll be coming back home
Sometimes, I seem to be fly
I just don't want you to say, "bye bye"

Hey baby, baby
Uh uh OH!

Baby, I got that feelin'
Baby can't help it
Alright
Baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby
Come on now
Come on now
Oh, oh, oh, ohEmbed
