1 ContributorPRINCESS PEACH LyricsShe said hit me up, cuz my parents ain't home
I pull up on her block, yeah she blowin up my phone
My shorty sweet like lemonade, cheese like provolone
My meat is like a hand grenade, touch it you get blown
(Ah!) This the type of shit I don't condone
Don't want no child support, I'm paying student loan
Clear the fucking runway, bitch I'm in my zone
She say I'm a rockstar, just like Post Malone
(Ah!) Turn around, drop your mans like bass
I don't give a fuck, bitch, I just want some face
Pull my pin, throw me far, then they run away
Got 6ix 9ine hair, all these bitches call me gay
(Uh!) On that binge, you know I'm on Netflix (Netflix!)
Salsa fire like my set list (Set list!)
Got an ice pack for my right wrist (Right wrist!)
All my drip evaporated like mist (Ice!)
Feel like Tetris, 'cause I'm dropping all these bars
Bitches call me Elon, I'll send your ass to mars
Can't switch lanes bitch, I don't own a car
All day grinding, I'm just try'na be a star
Ballin out everyday, try'na be Demar
All your songs weirder than the hard r
Hold on took this shit too far
Bitch I'm legendary, call me gold scar

Shorty got me shell shocked, lookin like she bowser
Homie hella sus looking at the web browser
I said what you doin, said he buying trousers
Why the fuck you lying, bitch, I pull out the power (Yuh!)
Homie ran faster than the Chargers (Chargers!)
Search history getting larger (Larger!)
He been on the bean, I think he need gasoline
Yeah he sippin on some lean, yeah he salty like saline (Aye!)
Don't got a clip but I got a magazine
I just ripped ass go ahead leave the scene (Ew!)
I don't have friends, homie, but I got some fiends
My homies real tight, just like skinny jeans
(Aye!) I'm in the kitchen (Kitchen!)
Cooking up, got some chicken (Cookin'!)
Ballin out, Scottie Pippen (Ballin'!)
Life is good, bitch I'm dreaming
(Yuh!) Feeling this wave
Like (Ooh!) get out my way
Homie you cray
Bitch not today
Give me my pay
Hard like Tay K
Make 'em go pray
Slide in like hey
She turn me down yeah she ruin my day
(Yeah! Aye!) I'd rather be gay (Aye!)
(Wait, woah, Princess Peach is not thirteen. Are you serious? Shit, I'm about to catch a case. You know what? Fuck it bro, I'm still finna smash.)Embed
