1 ContributorChildren Stories LyricsEverybody has a story told day by day
As the world keeps on turning, this life gets worse and worse
It's a typical story it happens everyday
It's the human struggle with the common threat
We struggle for a better day
Children stories!
Verse
I'd rather fight and keep on fighting, than die on my knees!
I'd rather keep fighting and fighting, and die for
What i believe!
