3 ContributorsShut Up And Explode Lyrics
Downfall, and it all falls down
I fall from grace, I got your taste
Turn off your mind, unwind
And see how high the cloudy sky

Run away, run away
Leave your lemon drop
Soak it up, soak it up
Won't you crush on me?
Run away, run away
Leave your lemon drop
Soak it up, soak it up
Won't you crush on me?

Running free, running free
Driving me insane
Shut it down, shut it down
It's about to explode

Run away, run away
Run away, run away
Run away, run away
Run away, run away
Run away, run away
Run away, run away
Run away, run away
Run away, run away
Run away, run away
Run away, run away
Run away, run away
Run away, run away
Run away, run away
Run away, run away
Run away, run away
Run away, run away
Run away, run away
Run away, run away
Run away, run away
Run away, run away
Run away, run away
Run away, run away
You might also like
I think I'm raw, so I draw
Just press the button, it's all so good
Now my heart bursts
Like a bottle of wine; you lose, you bite your lip

Let it down, let it down
Keep it in your heart
Bring it up, bring it up
Savor my world
Let it down, let it down
Keep it in your heart
Bring it up, bring it up
Savor my world

Let it out, Let it out
I make it burn
Bottle up, Bottle up
Count it all joy

Let it down, let it down
Let it down, let it down
Let it down, let it down
Let it down, let it down
Let it down, let it down
Let it down, let it down
Let it down, let it down
Let it down, let it down
Let it down, let it down
Let it down, let it down
Let it down, let it down
Let it down, let it down
Let it down, let it down
Let it down, let it down
Let it down, let it down
Let it down, let it down
Let it down, let it down
Let it down, let it down
Let it down, let it down
Let it down, let it down
Let it down, let it down
Let it down, let it down
Let it down, let it down
Let it down, let it down
Let it down, let it down
Let it down, let it down
Let it down, let it down
