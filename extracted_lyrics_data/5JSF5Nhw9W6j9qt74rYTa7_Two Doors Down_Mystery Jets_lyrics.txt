5 ContributorsTwo Doors Down Lyrics
I think I'm in love with the girl next door
It's driving me crazy, I can't take it anymore
I hear her playing the drums late at night
The neighbours complain, but that's the kind of girl I like

And maybe I should call her up and invite her around
Or maybe I should move to another town
But when I hear those drums late at night
I know I'm in love with a girl who lives (Two doors down)

I think I'm in love with a girl who lives (Two doors down)
I think I'm in love with a girl who lives (Two doors down)
I think I'm in love with a girl who lives (Two doors down)
I think I'm in love

She and her friends sit at the back of the bus
But I'm always to shy to work the courage up
I hear that she likes to dance around the room
To a worn out 12-inch of Marquee Moon

And maybe I should say "What's up?" and invite her around
Or take her for a spin around the town
'Cause when I hear those drums late at night
I know I'm in love with a girl who lives (Two doors down)
You might also like
I think I'm in love with a girl who lives (Two doors down)
I think I'm in love with a girl who lives (Two doors down)
I think I'm in love with a girl who lives (Two doors down)
I think I'm in love with a girl who lives (Two doors down)
I think I'm in love, I think I'm in love (Two doors down)
I think I'm in love with a girl who lives (Two doors down)
I think I'm in love, I think I'm in love (Two doors down)
I think I'm in love with a girl who lives

And maybe I should call her up and invite her around
And, one day, we could move to another town
'Cause when I hear those drums late at night
I know I'm in love, in love with a girl who lives

I think I'm in love with a girl who lives (Two doors down)
I think I'm in love with a girl who lives (Two doors down)
I think I'm in love with a girl who lives (Two doors down)
I think I'm in love with a girl who lives (Two doors down)
I think I'm in love, I think I'm in love (Two doors down)
I think I'm in love with a girl who lives (Two doors down)
I think I'm in love, I think I'm in love (Two doors down)
I think I'm in love with a girl who lives
I think I'm in love with a girl who lives
I think I'm in love with a girl who lives1Embed
