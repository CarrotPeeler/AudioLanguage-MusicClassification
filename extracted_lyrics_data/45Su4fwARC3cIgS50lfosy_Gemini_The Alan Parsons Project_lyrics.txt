6 ContributorsGemini Lyrics
Watching, waiting, rising, falling
Listening, calling, drifting
Touching, feeling, seein', believing
(I see your shadow coming closer every day)
Hoping, sending, leaving

I couldn't say why you and I are Gemini
If I tried to write a million words a day
I see your shadow coming closer
(I could not say why you and I are Gemini)
Then watch you drifting away

Watching, waiting, rising, falling
Listening, calling, drifting
Touching, stealing, seein', believing
Hoping, sending, leaving

I couldn't say why you and I are Gemini
We are travelling a million worlds away
I see your shadow coming closer
Then watch you drifting awaySee The Alan Parsons Project LiveGet tickets as low as $74You might also like2Embed
