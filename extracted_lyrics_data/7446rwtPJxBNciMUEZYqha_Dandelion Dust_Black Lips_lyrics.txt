Smoke 
 feeling 
Scarecrows with frowns
The witchy lady
She's feeling shady
Oh whoopsie daisy

Awake your eyes
Awake your eyes
Awake your eyes
I don't wanna die

Let me cross over
The two leaf clover
Dandelion dust all over

Flower power's in the thorns
Grab it by the horns
Scarecrows with frowns
You might also like
Awake your eyes
Awake your eyes
Awake your eyes
I don't wanna die
Awake your eyes
Awake your eyes
Awake your eyes
I don't wanna die

In 
Out by the crazy
It's voodoo, baby
Creeps are under their mouthsEmbed
