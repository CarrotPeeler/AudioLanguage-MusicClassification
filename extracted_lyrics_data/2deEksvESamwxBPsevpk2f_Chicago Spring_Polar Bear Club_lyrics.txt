1 ContributorChicago Spring LyricsThe seeds for place and time don't grow on fields like mine
We should leave it all behind with a young, bittersweet goodbye
But I need it, I want it I can't live without it
I'll hurt it, I'll fix it, and I'll worship and doubt it
It's all bittersweet goodbyes
Until the first light of my soul's Chicago spring
First light, a sliver that shines and the coldest heart sings
They cut the leaves for power lines each season
Like new ideas to dollar signs, you'll have to cut me up every time
The store brand is better than simply nothing at all
When the fire needs its starter
I'll take the store brand of my burning love
Until the first light of my soul's Chicago spring
First light, a sliver that shines and the coldest heart sings
Unforgiving, indifferent, it shines
It brings dust in the corners to life
Until the first light
Give up the last lie
Until the first light of my soul's Chicago spring
You might also like
It's a bitter and sweet goodbye but we're overdue for first light
First light of my soul's Chicago springEmbed
