1 ContributorYou go bird LyricsThis season seems to be the perfect frame
All you've ever longed for is peace with the ones who share your name
Do you crave to be a part?
Does it feel like you have lost you heart?
I see you in all that's good
This flame can't be put out
It will shine through every time
You go bird
This season comes to tell of years that made your scars
To tell you that you've failed to come across
All your friends are distant stars
I know they'll come to show
To save the spark that we all know
I see you in all that's good
This flame can't be put out
It will shine through every time
You go bird
I thought I knew what it meant to be alone
You've found more company in solitude than anyone
