4 ContributorsGot The Blues (Canâ€™t Be Satisfied) LyricsGot the blues, can't be satisfied
Got the blues, can't be satisfied
Keep the blues, I'll catch that train and ride
Whiskey straight will drive the blues away
Whiskey straight will drive the blues away
That be the case, I wants a quart today
Bought my gal a great big diamond ring
Bought my gal a great big diamond ring
Come right back home and caught her shaking that thing
I said, "Baby, what make you act this a-way?"
I said, "Baby, why did you act this a-way?"
Said, "I won't miss a thing she gives away"
Took my gun and I broke the barrel down
Took my gun, broke the barrel down
Put my baby six feet under the ground
I cut that joker, so long deep and wide
Cut that joker, so long deep and wide
You got the blues and still ain't satisfiedYou might also likeEmbed
