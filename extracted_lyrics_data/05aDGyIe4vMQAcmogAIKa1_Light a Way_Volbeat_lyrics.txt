12 ContributorsLight a Way Lyrics
Down by the lake of Mississippi
A boy was born poor and abandoned
And as he walked, you could hear him yearning
For a home and he prays

And by the fields, he sang for rising
All for his faith and memorizing
All of the songs his mother learned
From the Lord himself

Heaven light a way for a fallen
Let me ease the pain from my mother
But he feels the deception in his head

Another day was born and rising
And on the stool, the boy was trying
To earn a coin for his mother, and hoping
That freedom will lead her away

Mr. Cadillac Blood: dear little friend
I've heard your story
Please take my hand and I'll promise
We'll find a way and we'll be fighting
For your mother, and her wings
You might also like
Heaven light a way for a fallen
Let me ease the pain from my mother
But he feels the deception in his head


Heaven light a way for another
Let me ease the pain for a fallen
We are on our way so much stronger
Heaven light the way for another
And he feels no deception in his headEmbed
