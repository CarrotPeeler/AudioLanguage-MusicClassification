3 ContributorsUnlucky LyricsUnlucky, unlucky in love
What’s the reason I ask the stars above
I guess I’m just unlucky in love
In love
Disappointed most of the time
Where is that someone that’s supposed to be mine?
I guess I’m just unlucky in love
The sun and the moon take to the sky
Berries even take to the park
The birds and the leaves take to the trees
But don’t nobody take to me
Oh, unlucky, yes, until I die
All alone, just me, myself and I
I guess I’m just unlucky
Why am I so unlucky in love?You might also likeEmbed
