1 ContributorBrazil LyricsBrazil
Where hearts were entertaining June
We stood beneath an amber moon
And softly murmured
"Someday soon (Someday)
We kissed (We kissed)
And clung together
Then, tomorrow was another day
The morning found me miles away
With still a million things to say
Now, when twilight dims the sky above
Recalling thrills of our love
There's one thing I'm certain of
Return
I will to old
Brazil
(Return) Return
(I will) I will
(To old) To old
