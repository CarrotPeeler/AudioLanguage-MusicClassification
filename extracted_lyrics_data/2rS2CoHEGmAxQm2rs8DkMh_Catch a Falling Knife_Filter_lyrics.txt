Life was just a school yard
Life was just a playground
Life was just a sweet suburban memory
It got changed when I first meet you
It got changed and I just let you
I just had to keep the peace inside of me

I have spent my life in here
In your home but my hell
I have spent my life in here
In your home but my hell

Catch a falling knife
With a razor's edge
To catch a falling life
That's better off dead

Mom and Dad what happened?
I looked back and you were missing
It's been like that for such a long and lonely time
Life was just a school yard
Life was just a playground
Life was just a sweet suburban memory
You might also like
I have spent my life in here
In your home but my hell
I have spent my life in here
In your home but my hell

Catch a falling knife
With a razor's edge
To catch a falling life
That's better off dead

Change the world in me
You didn't let me see
Hearts grow black and cold
It was young and now it's old
Old

Catch a falling knife
With a razor's edge
To catch a falling life
That's better off dead

Catch a falling knife
With a razor's edge
To catch a falling life
That's better off dead
I have spent my life in here
In your home but my hell
I have spent my life in here
In your home but my hell

Catch a falling knife
With a razor's edge
To catch a falling life
That's better off deadEmbed
