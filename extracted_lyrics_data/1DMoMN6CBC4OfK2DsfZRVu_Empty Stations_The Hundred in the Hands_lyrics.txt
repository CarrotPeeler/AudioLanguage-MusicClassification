3 ContributorsEmpty Stations Lyrics
I listen to empty stations
And the sound of you there
An echo left on the dial
Paused in between

Midnight broadcasts (x4)
Your voice like white noise

You say, “We are passing away,”
I know it’s only goodbye
You say, “We are passing away,”
But I, I won’t miss you
I won’t miss you (x3)

I listen to empty stations
And the sound of you there
An echo left in the tunnel
On a train that never comes

Midnight broadcasts (x4)
Your touch like red rust
You might also like
You say, “We are passing away,”
I know it’s only goodbye
You say, “We are passing away,”
But I, I won’t miss you
I won’t miss you (x3)
Your voice like white noise
I won’t miss you
I won’t miss you
A kiss in the tunnels
I won’t miss you
I won’t miss you
I won’t miss youEmbed
