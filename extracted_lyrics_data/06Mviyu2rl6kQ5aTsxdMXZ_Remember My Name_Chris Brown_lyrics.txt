I need your touch, but your hands are locked away
I hear your voice, you've got nothin' left to say
I'll take this scar off my heart
I'll take this bullet, I'll take it for love

So if the lights in the sky come crashin' down
I still can find your love even in the crowd
But will you remember me?

Will you remember my name? (Ooh-ooh)
Remember my name (Ooh-ooh)
Will you remember my name? (Oh-oh)
Remember my name

I love you, I love you, I love you
Remember my—
I love you, I love you, I love you
Remember my name
I love you, I love you, I love you
Remember my—
I love you, I love you, I love you
Remember my name

I need your kiss, but your lips are far away
So I have no choice, so I guess I'll have to steal your love away
And I'll take this scar from my heart, bang-bang
I take this bullet (Bang-bang), I take it for love (Bang-bang)
I take it for love (Bang-bang), I’ll take it for us

Will you remember my name? (My name, my name, my name)
Remember my name (My name, my name)
Will you remember my name? (My name, my name, my name)
Oh, remember my name (My name)

I love you, I love you, I love you
Remember my—
I love you, I love you, I love you
Remember my name
I love you, I love you, I love you
Remember my—
I love you, I love you, I love you
Remember my name

Floatin' above the clouds and sky
Wishin' upon a fallin' star
Hopin' my love hasn't forgotten my name
It's automatic, this attraction, this love is so strong
Two birds up above, baby, wishin' we could float off
And we can fly higher, babe, higher, babe
Higher, babe, higher, babe, higher, babe
Just fly high, higher babe, higher, babe
Higher, babe, higher, babe
All gas, no breaks, I just wanna levitate
All gas, no breaks, I just wanna levitate
All gas, no breaks, I just wanna levitate
Just wanna levitate, I just wanna levitate
Will you remember my name? (My name, my name, my name, remember my name)
Remember my name (My name, my name, remember my name)
Will you remember my name? (Oh-oh, my name, my name)
Remember my name (My name)
