Well I've been neglecting the good things, oh, oh, oh
What I mean is I need the good things, oh, oh
I'm finding the light in the good things, oh, oh, oh
I might need help to see the good things, oh, oh

Shake me out of my misery, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, make me
Get out and wiggle it, oh, oh, oh

Clap your hands, clap your hands
Turn the lights on my nights
This is life and we only get one chance
Oh, clap your hands, clap your hands
Come on dance, take a chance on romance
We only get one shot at love
Oh, clap your hands, clap your hands
Turn the lights on my nights
This is life and we only get one chance
Oh, clap your hands, clap your hands
Come on dance, take a chance on romance
We only get one shot at love
Oh, clap your hands (clap your hands)
You might also like
I'm trying to fly in the good things, oh, oh, oh
I'm finding this might be a good thing, oh, oh

Shake me out of my misery, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, make me
Get out and wiggle it, oh, oh, oh

Clap your hands, clap your hands
Turn the lights on my nights
This is life and we only get one chance
Oh, clap your hands, clap your hands
Come on dance, take a chance on romance
We only get one shot at love
Oh, clap your hands, clap your hands
Turn the lights on my nights
This is life and we only get one chance
Oh, clap your hands, clap your hands
Come on dance, take a chance on romance
We only get one shot at love
Oh, clap your hands (clap your hands)

Clap your hands, clap your hands (oh)
Turn the lights on my nights
This is life and we only get one chance
Oh, clap your hands, clap your hands (oh)
Come on dance, take a chance on romance
We only get one shot at love
Oh, clap your hands, clap your hands (oh)
Turn the lights on my nights
This is life and we only get one chance
Oh, clap your hands, clap your hands (oh)
Come on dance, take a chance on romance
We only get one shot at love
Oh, clap your hands (oh, clap your hands)9Embed
