1 ContributorTangled LyricsCry Out
You must mistake me for someone
You used to know when you were down off the shelf
Misplaced mistrust you're hurting your inner world
The only place where life is made
But why can't I see why can't I see
What's right in front of me
And why can't I feel why can't I feel
What it is that touches me
A cautious man at times prevails through the trials in life
But there's something to say for the man who goes for it all
We're a framework of pieces we place as we see fit
To love is to learn and to learn is to grow
But why can't I see why can't I see
What's right in front of me
And why can't I feel why can't I feel
What it is that touches me
Because time and time again I hear the same old line that twists inside my head
Is it calling me?
Or is it killing me?
I'm just trying to figure out what your intent is
Do you plan on staying or are you just gonna burn another hole?
Don't you know what you mean to me?
You might also likeA suicidal glance inside my head
It won't reveal a glittered glamorous path
'Cause it's the pain that I feel makes a man grow inside
To open up his eyes
To try to see through deception
To try to see through the next lie
Don't you know what you mean to me?Embed
