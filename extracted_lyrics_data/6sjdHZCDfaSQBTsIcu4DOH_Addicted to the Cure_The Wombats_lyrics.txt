5 ContributorsAddicted To The Cure Lyrics
Lately, I
Have been speculating
As to how, when and why
These circles race whatever I do
Your blonde hair
Breaks this ten-thousand-yard stare
Clearly, I
Am still withdrawing, it's true

(Ah, ah, ah)
Something's not right here
The paint watches me as I dry here
The pain watches me as I waltz through
This black hole
And I don't feel violent
In fact, I feel somewhat enlightened
The best of us always seem to have
The most downfalls

There's a cigarette in my mouth
A nicotine patch is on the floor
When did we get addicted to the cure?
(Ah-ah, ah-ah; ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah-ah)
I am addicted to the cure
(Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah-ah)

Sometimes, I
Get aggravated
With my concept of time
And how the clocks tick backwards on cue
Your blonde hair
Breaks this wristwatch and its cares
Clearly, I (Clearly, I)
Am still withdrawing from you

(Ah, ah, ah)
Something's not right here
The paint watches me as I dry here
The pain watches me as I waltz through
This black hole
And I don't feel violent
In fact, I feel somewhat enlightened
The best of us always seem to have
The most downfalls

There's a cigarette in my mouth
A nicotine patch is on the floor
When did we get addicted?
When did we get addicted?
But our heads tell us to stop
As our chests scream out for more
I'm proud to be addicted
I'm proud to be addicted to the cure
(Ah-ah, ah-ah; ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah-ah)
I am addicted to the cure
(Ah-ah, ah-ah; ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah-ah)
I am addicted to the cure
I am addicted to the cure1Embed
