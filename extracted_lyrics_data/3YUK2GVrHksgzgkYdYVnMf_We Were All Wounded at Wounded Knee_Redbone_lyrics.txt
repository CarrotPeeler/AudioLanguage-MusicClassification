7 ContributorsWe Were All Wounded at Wounded Knee LyricsWe were all wounded at Wounded Knee
You and me
We were all wounded at Wounded Knee
You and me
In the Name of Manifest Destiny
You and me
You and me
You and me
They made us many Promises
But always broke their Word
They penned us in like Buffalo
Drove us like a herd
And finally on the Reservation
We were going for our Preservation
We were all wiped out by the seventh Calvary
You and me
You and me
We were all wounded at Wounded Knee
You and me
We were all wounded at Wounded Knee
You and me
In the Name of Manifest Destiny
You and me
You and me
You and me
You might also likeNow we make our Promises
We won't break our Word
We'll sing, sing, sing out our Story
Till the Truth is heard
There's a whole new Generation
Which will dream of Veneration
Who were not wiped out by the seventh Calvary
You and me
You and me
We were all wounded at Wounded Knee
You and me
We were all wounded at Wounded Knee
You and me
We were all wounded by Wounded Knee
