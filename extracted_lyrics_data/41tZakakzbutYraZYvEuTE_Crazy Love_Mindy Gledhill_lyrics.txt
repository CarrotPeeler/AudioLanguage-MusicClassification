2 ContributorsCrazy Love Lyrics
Nobody knows, that I am a secret spy.
I follow you home, careful to walk behind you.
I climb up your tree,
and hide in the leaves,
to keep you from seeing who I am.
Call me obsessed, but I need to know your name.
Your age, your address. And where in the world you came from.
It's silly to think, that I'm on the brink,
of falling right off my rocker!

Ohhhh,
I wanna know, all about your mom,
and your favorite song and
Why...
You hypnotize me,
well I'll tell you why, I'm the definition of...
Obsessive, compulsive, crazy love!

Late after dark,
Your light is on upstairs.
And I watch you dance, as if you were Fred Astaire!
A little finesse,
A sparkly dress,
And I could be Ginger Rogers!
Ohhh, I wanna know...
All the books you read and...
Your favorite sweets and...
Why you hypnotize me, well I'll tell you why, I'm the definition of...
Obsessive, compulsive, crazy la-la love.

I'm like a firefly, la la love...
In the evening sky.
I'm all aglow, whenever I see you walking by.

Ohhhhh, I wanna know, if you ever plan...
To hold my hand and...
Why you hypnotize me, well I'll tell you why, I'm the definition...
Ohhh, I wanna know, if you ever plan to hold my hand, and...
Why, you hypnotize me, well I'll tell you why, I'm the definition of...
Obsessive, compulsive, crazy love!Embed
