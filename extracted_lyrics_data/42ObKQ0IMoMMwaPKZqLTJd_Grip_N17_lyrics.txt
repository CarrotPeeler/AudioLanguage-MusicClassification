1 ContributorGrip LyricsThoughts of endless oppression
Continue bleeding rain within the grey
Brittle roses to pave all the wisdom
In which closed gates create
Brick wall of rigid self control
Manic nirvana controlled
Built a brick wall that I can't climb
And nobody knows
I try
I walk with the wings of broken desire
As the wolf stalks me as his prey
The cracks in my hand break only larger
From bludgeoning memories writhing
Screaming and crying I ponder
Reaching for the break of day
Rotting in the lonely lust of the shadows
That only I could create
Barbed wire fencе of self oppression
Pulled tight around my brain
Imaginеd fear tints the reality
That darkens everything I see
Brick wall of rigid self control
Manic nirvana controlled
Built a brick wall that I can't climb
And nobody knows
I try
