3 ContributorsPlaying With The Fire LyricsFire'll never lose the fight it fights
It can be smothered but it will always come back
To burn men's contempt and show its force
To revenge the offences to this Earth
Wherever I go
All I see are fools
Playing with the Fire
Wherever I hide
Someone by my side
Plays with the Fire
No-one'll ever subjugate its force
The sweet dance of Flames is rebel to our will
It can purify the dirt of souls
It will help those who will know its law
Wherever I go
All I see are fools
Playing with the Fire
Wherever I hide
Someone by my side
Plays with the Fire
Wherever I go
All I see are fools
Playing with the Fire
Wherever I hide
Someone by my side
Plays with the Fire
You might also likeSome are too pretentious to respect
But Fate will remember all their deeds
As the cycles start they end one day
The Fire will be here to laugh and play
Wherever I go
All I see are fools
Playing with the Fire
Wherever I hide
Someone by my side
