At night you know that I will find you
It's been the same way for three years
I know every bar in this town
I'll just have to find the right one
I get in through the door and you look terribly engaged
I have a couple of drinks and pretend I haven't seen you
But sooner or later we'll be
The event of the evening 'cause

My girl and me
We hang around in bars and we're—
Usually drunk, but never too drunk to fight
Like cats and dogs all night
My girl and me
We hang around in bars and we're—
Usually drunk, but never too drunk to fight
Like cats and dogs all night

You'll say that you can do without me
And you have the right to be free
And on top of that you say that
You shouldn't be seen with me
I for my part point out that I'm overly embarrassed
By seeing how you're trying to impress a nice young man
Who is far more sober than you
We're not at all nice 'cause
You might also like
My girl and me
We hang around in bars and we're—
Usually drunk, but never too drunk to fight
Like cats and dogs all night
My girl and me
We hang around in bars and we're—
Usually drunk, but never too drunk to fight
Like cats and dogs all night

Wine is a mocker
Strong drink is raging
And whomsoever is deceived thereby
Is not wise
Proverbs, Chapter 20
Part 4: Warnings and instructions
Part 4: Warnings and instructions
And instructions

My girl and me
We hang around in bars and we're—
Usually drunk, but never too drunk to fight
Like cats and dogs all night
My girl and me
We hang around in bars and we're—
Usually drunk, but never too drunk to fight
Like cats and dogs all night
My girl and me
We hang around in bars and we're—
Usually drunk, but never too drunk to fight
Like cats and dogs all night
Like cats and dogs all night
Like cats and dogs all night
Like cats and dogs all night
Like cats and dogs all night
Like cats and dogs all night1Embed
