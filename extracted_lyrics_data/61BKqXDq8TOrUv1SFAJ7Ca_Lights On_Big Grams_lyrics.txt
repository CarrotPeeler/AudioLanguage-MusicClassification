15 ContributorsLights On Lyrics
When the bars say stop, when the bars all start to close
And it gets dark outside and I can't find my way home
I hope you keep your lights on for me
I hope you keep your lights on for me
Tonight feels like a dark Siamese twin (With you)
Can't tell if it ends or it begins (With you)
But I know that I can't see straight
So I'm hopin' lights are always bright for us to chase
I know that they will

When the bars say stop, when the bars all start to close
And it gets dark outside and I can't find my way home
I hope you keep your lights on for me
I hope you keep your lights on for me
I hope you keep your lights on for me
I hope you keep your lights on for me

And now I think I'm floating in space
And there's no one around to help me find some gravity
Can you see all the stars exploding, burning in my face?
'Cause it's all I need, the galaxies to finally play
I know that they will
You might also like
When the bars say stop, when the bars all start to close
And it gets dark outside and I can't find my way home
I hope you keep your lights on for me
I hope you keep your lights on for me
I hope you keep your lights on for me
I hope you keep your lights on for me (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah leave the lights on)

Whoever thought that I would be the one
The golden child, even in darkness, I can see the sun
I beat my drum and live my life to the rhythm
I had the blues once or twice in my lifetime, but I swear I never lose
'Cause I lost so much when I was younger
Savannah, Georgia
The darkest nights produce the brightest stars
So give me credit, I keep it A1 like FICO scores
See we at war like some vikings came to conquer all
Materialism is a prison so go and fuck it all
Now 'Twan can ball, check my catalog
I'm lookin' for substance out of you puppets taking Adderall
Self medicating, doing damage to your bladder, dawg
It doesn't matter, you were sadder when you had it all

When the bars say stop, when the bars all start to close
And it gets dark outside and I can't find my way home
I hope you keep your lights on for me
I hope you keep your lights on for me
I hope you keep your lights on for me
I hope you keep your lights on for me5Embed
