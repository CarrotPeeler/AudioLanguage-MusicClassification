5 ContributorsWhere We Belong LyricsOh, take these stones away
Start a brand new story
I'll make it through each day
Singing death or glory
Lord won't answer me
I won't let it bring me down
I know these clouds are gray
That I am living under
I know I'll be okay
With the rain or thunder
I hear it calling me
I won't march into the sound
Ooooooohhhhhhhhh, Woah
I just get this feeling
You're holding me down
And these answers I'm needing
I guess they're being smothered by the sound
Of all this emotion
And all of this hate
Still I keep searching for something to put my faith in, to find my place so I keep singing
Oh, take these stones away
Start a brand new story
I'll make it through each day
Singing death or glory
Lord won't answer me
I won't let it bring me down
You might also likeOoooooooohhhhhhhhh, Woah
Hold on
Hold on
We'll move along
Where we belong
Where we belong
My heart, my soul
I don't need a vision
I'd like to embrace
And not only false promises, hopes and wishes
To find my place
So I keep singing
Oh, take these stones away
Start a brand new story
I'll make it through each day
Singing death or glory
Lord won't answer me
I won't let it bring me down
Oooooooooohhhhhhhhhh, Woah
Where we belong
Where we belong
My heart, my soul
We stand alone
Hold on
Hold on
Where we belong
My heart, my song
We stand alone
Hold on
Hold on
Where we belong
My heart, my song
We stand alone
Hold on
Hold on
Where we belong
My heart, my soul
YYEEAAAAHHHHHH!
Oh, take these stones away
Start a brand new story
I'll make it through each day
Singing death or glory
Lord won't answer me
I won't let it bring me downEmbed
