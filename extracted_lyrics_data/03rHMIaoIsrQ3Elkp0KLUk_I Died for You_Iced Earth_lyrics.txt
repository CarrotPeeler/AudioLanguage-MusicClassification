12 ContributorsI Died for You Lyrics
I can't believe this now
This isn't what I planned
I lived and died and now
I just can't understand
With all the love I feel
I could never leave her
No matter what the cost
My soul's the price to see her

Oh how I love you
The pain won't go away
Oh when I need you
You're always so far away
I cry for you
Leaving myself to blame
I died for you
I gave up everything

The pain was just too much
When I finally saw her
She's happy and in love
In love with my best friend
What makes it hurt so bad
Is that I love them both
And they will never know
For love I sold my soul
You might also like
Oh how I love you
The pain won't go away
Oh when I need you
You're always so far away
I cry for you
Leaving myself to blame, yeah
I died for you
I gave up everything


Oh how I love you
The pain won't go away
(And when I need you) Oh when I need you (I need you)
You're always so far away
(And I cry) I cry for you (For you)
Leaving myself to blame (I need you)
(I died)
I died for you
(For you)
I gave up everything
Oh how I love you
The pain won't go away
Oh when I need you
You're always so far away
I cry for you
Leaving myselfEmbed
