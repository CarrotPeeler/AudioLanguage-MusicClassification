5 ContributorsZoom In Lyrics
Stood on the line
You understand
I've been waiting forever
Come rain come shine
In the wind in the snow
In the filthy weather
You've got it all worked out
Yeah but it knocks you out
But I'm zooming in
Now she arrives
In a flaming crash
Like a falling star
Heading straight for the dive
Going to make some cash
With that avatar

You got it all worked out
I know you know
I don't want you to go
Yeah but it knocks you out
I'm zooming in on you on you
You might also like
Don't look back, we're an art attack 
You got it all worked out
Yeah but it knocks you out
We're not alone
In this second life
There are millions like us
Right here
In the stones
In the air too bright
All the new insiders

You got it all worked out
I know you know
I don't want you to go
Yeah but it knocks you out
I'm zooming in on you on you

Na na na na na na
I know you know
I don't want you to go
Na na na na na na
I'm zooming in and out on you
I'm zooming in and out on you
Zooming in and out on you
Na na na na na na
I know you know
I don't want you to go
Na na na na na na
I'm zooming in and out on youEmbed
