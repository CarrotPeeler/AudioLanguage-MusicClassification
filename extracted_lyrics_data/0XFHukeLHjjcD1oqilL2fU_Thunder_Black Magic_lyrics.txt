6 ContributorsKing of the Jungle Lyrics"It was an African day like most African days
Hot humid, and miserable"
(Ice Cube)
The Jungle Don is the king of the jungle
Bout as strong as he can be
(Maulkie)
Cause I'm a G with the LM
You better run and tell em
The trick ass bitches are gettin dumped in the ditches
All day so you know it's all good
I'm far from Toby, more like Monster Kody
I'm iceberg slim, cause I'm cool like that
I'm gee like that, a pearl-handled gat
It ain't no thang for me to watch people hang
Cause he don't wanna rumble in my motherfuckin jungle
(Ice Cube)
Short dog is the king of the jungle
Bout as strong as he can be
(Shorty)
Cause I'mma G, sippin on the tropical thriller
You hear the roar, down boy it's my big gorilla killer
As I pass by, lookin for an alibi
Do a swing by on the pale guy
Go to the finish, big Texas is next
Stuck him in the neck and I'm beatin on my chest
(Ice Cube)
T-Bone is the king of the jungle
Bout as strong as he can be
(T-Bone)
Cause I'mma G, get back as I gat at the fear
I pack my gear with the hard rock tip I digs it in the dip
Out of the dip comes a thrill with the pointed tip
The devil don't do shit, I keeps my hand on my bamboo spear
Oh dear, I smell fear coming from the rear of the jungle
No wonder, he's gung ho
Lookin for the bozo oh no, the king of the jungle

I'm the k-k-k-k-k-k-k-k-k-k-k-king
I'm the k-k-k-k-k-k-k-k-k-k-k-king
I'm the k-k-k-k-k-k-k-k-k-k-k-king
I'm the k-k-k-k-k-k-k-k-k-k-k-king
Uh get upa, get down
Get on upa, get down
Get on upa, get down
Get on upa get down
(Ice Cube)
The jungle man is the king of the jungle
Bout as strong as he can be
(Maulkie)
Motherfuckin is talk, the Lench Mob fell off
There's no proof in his breath with the tech to get wrecked
Gorilla pimp slappin on this ho ass tricks
JD pick me up, oh this doll has nice tits
The Mob is deep, always causin tension
Bestebas still killin and lynchin
Fool, this is Lench Mob so feel the wrath
You motherfuckers don't even know the half
(Ice Cube)
Short dog is the king of the jungle
Bout as strong as he can be
(Shorty)
And that's me, deep in the jungle where the Dog is the one
Let me count a gun on the singular drum
Dum, ditty dum ditty ditty dum dum
Here we come here we come, here we kitty come come
Bring the thunder the black magic wonder
Lench mob'll get 'cha just don't whip me with no whip
Razzamatazz I'm from the TRIBE of Shabazz
A blast from the past, hittin that ass
(Ice Cube)
T-Bone is the king of the jungle
Bout as strong as he can be
(T-Bone)
Who me? "Yes" Back to the jungle vines swingin
Ding a linging broke a neck back and lookin for some red neck crackas
Rigged and givin the fuckin shit when I check 1, 2
Devil what you wanna do???
When you see the voo doo, you ask who's who
The Lench mob crew, we comin brand new
So check it, can I wreck it for a second?
1, 2, 3 yeah I'm still a fuckin G
(CHORUS)
