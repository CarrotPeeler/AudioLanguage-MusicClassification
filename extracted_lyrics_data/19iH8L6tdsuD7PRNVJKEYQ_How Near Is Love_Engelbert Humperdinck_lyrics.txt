1 ContributorHow Near Is Love LyricsThey tell me how far that you fly to the moon
And name all the stars that shine above
On Venus and Mars we will be very soon
Oh, but I want to know how near is love
When you're close to me I could touch the sky
At times I can see heaven in your eyes
You don't know the pain of loving in vain
So please tell me now how near is love
When you're close to me I could touch the sky
At times I can see heaven in your eyes
You don't know the pain of loving in vain
So please tell me now how near is love
So please tell me now how near is loveSee Engelbert Humperdinck LiveGet tickets as low as $80You might also likeEmbed
