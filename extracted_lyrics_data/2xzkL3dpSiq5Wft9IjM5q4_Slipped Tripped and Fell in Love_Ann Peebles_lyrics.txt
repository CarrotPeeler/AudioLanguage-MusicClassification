2 ContributorsSlipped, Tripped And Fell In Love LyricsI knew from the very beginning
What you had in mind
But I said to myself, baby
You're gon' just be wasting your time
Cos somehow during the night
Things started to get out of hand
And before I knew it, baby
I was giving my love away again
You know I...
Slipped, tripped, fell in love
And you slipped your love on me
You know I...
Slipped, tripped, fell in love
Then you slipped your love on me
Getting hooked on you, baby
Was the last thing on my mind
Now you got me wanting you, baby
Wanting you all the time
When you touch me
I just lose control
I find myself, baby
Wanting more
You might also likeOh Lord
Said I...
Slipped, tripped, fell in love
Then you slipped your love on me
What you did
I slipped, tripped, fell in love
Then you slipped your love on me
Ooh yeah
I know you did
But I ain't worried about it
No no
Oh yeah
Said I...
Slipped, tripped, fell in love
And you slipped your love on me
I slipped, tripped, fell in love
Then you slipped your love in me...Embed
