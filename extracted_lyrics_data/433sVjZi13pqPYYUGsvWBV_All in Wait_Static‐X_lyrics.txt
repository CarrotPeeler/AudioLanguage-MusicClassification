11 ContributorsAll In Wait Lyrics
Drowning myself
Over and over
Desolate, trying
It's over

Why so cynical in life?
You think you're living to die
All in wait, all in wait

Burning inside
Long for answers
Makes no sense
Trying, it's over

Why so cynical in life?
You think you're living to die
(Living to die, living to die, living to die)
All in wait
Step down and smile at this fool
That believes his own word
(His own word, his own word, his own word)
All in wait
You might also like
(Drowning myself over)
All in wait

Now I'm drowning myself
Over and over
(Drowning myself over)
Desolate, we're trying
But you say it's over
All in wait
Drowning myself over
Drowning myself
Drowning myself
Drowning myself
All in wait

Why so cynical in life?
You think you're living to die
(Living to die, living to die, living to die)
All in wait
Step down and smile at this fool
That believes his own word
(His own word, his own word, his own word)
All in wait
Now I'm drowning myself
Over and over
Desolate, we're trying
But you say it's over
Burning inside, as we
Long for these answers
Makes no sense, we're trying
But you say it's over
OverEmbed
