2 ContributorsSo Quiet LyricsIt was oh so quiet
Oh it was so quiet that winter
I was dreaming
Dreaming of your sound
Spring came
Along with the spring came good fortune
Laughing all day
Nothing was getting us down
And we sat and listened as the music played
Oh how I wish that you could have stayed
Don't go with the wind
Don't go with the wind
Summer came and you went a-wandering
I remain, I shall not follow
Think often of you and I wish you well
I remain, I shall not follow
And I sat and listened to the same old songs
Oh I knew I couldn't go along
Oh you went with the wind
Oh you went with the windYou might also likeEmbed
