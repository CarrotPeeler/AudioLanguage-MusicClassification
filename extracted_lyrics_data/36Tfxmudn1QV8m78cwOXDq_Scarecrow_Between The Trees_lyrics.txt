Just try and fit in this hollow mat
'Cause you've traveled so far
From where it all began
Maybe I wasn't made for this world
Maybe I wasn't made for this world
All the space in between the soul and the seams
Maybe I wasn't made for this world
I think I took the wrong path
And I need to find my way back
They say you're never too far
To start it all again, am I too far?
Maybe I wasn't made for this world
Maybe I wasn't made for this world
All the space in between the soul and the seams
Maybe I wasn't made for this world
Oh scarecrow, oh scarecrow
Is it really that bad?
Oh scarecrow, oh scarecrow
Is it really that bad?
Maybe I wasn't made for this world
Maybe I wasn't made for this world
All the space in between the soul and the seams
Maybe I wasn't made for this world

All the space in between the soul and the seams
Maybe I wasn't made for this world
Oh scarecrow, oh scarecrow
Is it really that bad?
Oh scarecrow, oh scarecrow
Maybe I wasn't made for this world
Oh scarecrow, oh scarecrow
Is it really that bad?
Oh scarecrow, oh scarecrow
Maybe I wasn't made for this world
Oh scarecrow, oh scarecrowEmbed
