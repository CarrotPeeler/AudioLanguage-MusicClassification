7 ContributorsLove Myself LyricsNothing left for you, baby
Not a yes, or a maybe
Ain't no reason to hang around here
Find somebody else
Can't you see that I'm crazy
And I don't want you to hate me
But, you know I can't stick around here
See, I don't love myself
So, how can I expect somebody else to do the things that I...
That I can't do myself?
So, I won't hurt nobody else anymoreSee JMSN LiveGet tickets as low as $87You might also like3Embed
