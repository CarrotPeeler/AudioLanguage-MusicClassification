2 ContributorsHappy Harvest LyricsFlowers, flowers, don't be sad
We'll put you in a vase
Puppies, puppies don't be mad
We'll lock you in a cage
Good ole' Spot see how he dances
Since we fed him Drano
Why does Timmy clap his hands?
Broken glass in his Play-Doh
Rabbit, rabbit, hippety hop
Or we'll throw you in the river
Sister Susie never cries
Ever since we ate her liver
Horsey, horsey, clippety-clop
Who clipped off your ears?
Mommy, mommy, why so blue?
I guess you want some air
Pussy, pussy at the zoo
With Daddy in his claws
Baby Amy just 1 year old
Playing with the chainsaw
Grandma, grandma, don't be cross
Or we'll hide your medication
Grandpa, grandpa talks baby talk
Ever since the operationYou might also likeEmbed
