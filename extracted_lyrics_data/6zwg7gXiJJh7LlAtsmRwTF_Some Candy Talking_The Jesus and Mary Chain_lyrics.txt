7 ContributorsSome Candy Talking LyricsI'm going down to the place tonight
To see if I can get the taste tonight
A taste of something warm and sweet
That shivers your bones and rises to your heat
I'm going down to the place tonight
The damp and hungry place tonight
Should all the stars shine in the sky
They couldn't outshine your sparkling eyes
But it's so hard to be the one
To touch and tease and to do it all for fun
But it's too much for a young heart to take
'Cause hearts are the easiest things you could break
And I talk to the filth, and I walk through the door
I'm knee deep in myself, but I want to get more
Of that stuff, of that stuff
Some candy talking, some candy talking
Talk
And I want
And I want
Some candy talking, some candy talking
Some candy talking, some candy talking
Some candy talk, some candy talk
Some candy talk, some candy talk

I love the way she's talking
It's just the way she's walking
It's just the way she's talking
And I need all that stuff
Give me some of that stuff
I want your candy, I want your candy
And I need, give me some
Of your stuff, give me some
I want your candy, I want your candy
I want your candy, I want your candy
I want stuff1Embed
