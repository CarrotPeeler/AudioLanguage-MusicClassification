Sophisticated lady
Sophisticated lady
She's a different lady with a different style
She stands tall and steady like the Eiffel Tower
She is hip to politics
But loves her jazz
She's got lots of rhythm
She's got lots of class
Everybody knows how she got her name, yeah
Oh, ha
She wears knee length dresses
With her high heel steppers
She's not no back stabber
But she's sure a pleaser
She talks quiet and gentle
She acts very cool
She sticks close to her lover
She obey God's rules, whoa

(Sophisticated lady)
Sophisticated lady, yeah
(Sophisticated lady)
Oh
(Sophisticated lady)
That's her name
That's her name
(Sophisticated lady)
Whoa, whoa
Everybody knows how she got her name
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Whoa oh, oh, oh, oh
You might also like
She's the kind of person that
You'd like to meet
'Cause she's always smiling
And she's always neat
She can start a fire
In the coldest man
She's a hip slick sister
Known throughout the land, oh

(Sophisticated lady)
That's her name
Sophisticated lady
(Sophisticated lady)
Yeah
Oh, well, woo, woo, woo
Woo, woo, woo, hoo
That's her name
Sophisticated lady
(Sophisticated lady)
Lady, lady
Sophisticated lady
(Sophisticated lady)
Oh
Sophisticated lady
(Sophisticated lady)
Ah
Sophisticated lady
(Sophisticated lady)
Ooh, ooh
(Sophisticated lady)
