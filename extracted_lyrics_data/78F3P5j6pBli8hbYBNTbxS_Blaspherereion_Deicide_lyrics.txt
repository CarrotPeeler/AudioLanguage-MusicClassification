Bleeding death, undead, broke the seal Suhrim
Desecrate, evil ghost Thoth freed him
Mass destruction, ended lives, blasphemation, you will die

Darkest one, bleeding death, from beyond
Death be done, no regression, unforbidden
You will die - It's been written

Die - Blaspherereion
Die - Blaspherereion

Vicious wrath Adar, torted past rendered
Odious evil, elder death, feast us
God's construction, holy doom
Don't believe, you're consumed

Darkest one, bleeding death, from beyond
Death be done, no regression, unforbidden
You will die - It's been written

Die - Blaspherereion
Die - Blaspherereion
You might also like
Lord chaos, death, save us
Kill human kind, life was denied
Lord black death, Thoth, confess
Send to desecrate, lord blasphemate

Darkest one, bleeding death, from beyond
Death be done, no regression, unforbidden
You will die - It's been written

Die - Blaspherereion
