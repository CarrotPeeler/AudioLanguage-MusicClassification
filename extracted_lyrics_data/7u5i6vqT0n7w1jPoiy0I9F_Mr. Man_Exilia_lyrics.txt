I've cried and screamed to the heavens
I've seen the blacjest of noghts
I've kicjed the wall to the ground
Nothing's never ever benn easy
Nothing's ever been so real
Nothing's never ever been easy
Nothing's ever been so real for me
For every time I had to cry
I had to believe even stronger
Even had to watch you walk away
For every tear that had to fall
I had to get up on my own
That's the only way to be myself
For every promise you broke
Mr Man you should know
No tears,no fears,still here
I've seen a milion faces
Been to a thousand laces
I know every word
That Mr Man is going to say
And you heaven't stopped me yet
I will never lose my faith
No, you heaven't stopped me yet
I will never lose my faith in me
You might also likeFor every time I had to cry
I had to believe even stronger
Aven had to watch you walk away
For every tear that had to fall
I had to get up on my own
That's the only way to be myself
For every promise you broke
For every promise you broke
Mr Man you should know
No tears,no fears,still here
For every day that you stole
Mr Man you should know
No tears,no fears,still here
No tears,no fears,still here
