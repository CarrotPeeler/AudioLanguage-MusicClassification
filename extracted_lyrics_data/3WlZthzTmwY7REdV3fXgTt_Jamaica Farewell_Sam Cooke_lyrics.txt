4 ContributorsJamaica Farewell Lyrics
Down the way where the nights are gay
And the sun shines dearly on the mountain top
I took a trip on a sailing ship
And when I reached Jamaica I made a stop

But I'm sad to say I'm on my way
Won't be back for many a day
My heart is down, my heart is turning around
I had to leave a little girl in Kingston Town

Sounds of laughter everywhere
And the dancing girls swing to and fro
I must declare my heart is there
Though Iâ€™ve from Maine to Mexico

But I'm sad to say I'm on my way
Won't be back for many a day
My heart is down, my heart is turning around
I had to leave a little girl in Kingston Town

Down at the market you can hear
Ladies cry out while on their heads they bear
Ackee rice, salt fish on ice
And the rum is fine any time of year
You might also like
But I'm sad to say I'm on my way
I won't be back for many a day
My heart is down, my heart is turning around
I had to leave a little girl in Kingston Town

Sad to say I'm on my way
Won't be back for many a day
My heart is down, my heart is turning around
I had to leave a little girl in Kingston TownEmbed
