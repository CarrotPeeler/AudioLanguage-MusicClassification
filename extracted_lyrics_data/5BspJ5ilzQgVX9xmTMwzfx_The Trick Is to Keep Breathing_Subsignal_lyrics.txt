1 ContributorThe Trick is to Keep Breathing LyricsHow can we move on
With all the scars that numb the soul?
How can we just simply smile
While half the world is going down?
(This time, going down, this time)
Oh, if love is not enough this time
What is left to cling to?
While avidity just grows, the more we know
The less we seem to care
All that we can do in this cold
All that we can do in this emptiness (this emptiness)
All that we can do in this life
All that we can do is keep breathing now (keep breathing now)
All that we can do in this light
All that we can do on this winding road (this winding road)
All that we can do in this life
All that we can do is keep going on (keep going on and on)
So many times we blindly throw away
What has been given
And even more times we surrender to
The writing on the wall
You might also like(This time, it's going down, this time)
And you and me holding a plain truth
That change is no illusion
But in the wake of circumstance we'll walk on to
Where the story ends
All that we can do in this cold
All that we can do in this emptiness (this emptiness)
All that we can do in this life
All that we can do is keep breathing now (keep breathing now)
All that we can do in this light
All that we can do on this winding road (this winding road)
All that we can do in this life
All that we can do is keep going on, going on and onEmbed
