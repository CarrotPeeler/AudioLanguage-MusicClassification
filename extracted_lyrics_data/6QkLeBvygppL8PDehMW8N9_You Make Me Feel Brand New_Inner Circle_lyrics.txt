I'll never find the words my love, to tell you how I feel my love
Mere words, could not explain
Precious love
You held my life within your hands, created everything I am
Taught me how to live again
Only you
Came when I needed a friend, believed in me through thick and thin
This song is for you, filled with gratitude and love
God bless you, you make me feel brand new
For God bless me with you, you make me feel brand new
I sing this song 'cause you, make me feel brand new
My love
When ever I was insecure, you built me up and made me sure
You gave, my pride, back to me
Precious friend
With you I'll always have a friend, your someone who I can depend
To walk a path that sometimes bends
Without you
Life has no meaning or rhyme, like notes to a song out of time
How can I repay, you'll find heaven, faith and me

For God bless me with you, you make me feel brand newEmbed
