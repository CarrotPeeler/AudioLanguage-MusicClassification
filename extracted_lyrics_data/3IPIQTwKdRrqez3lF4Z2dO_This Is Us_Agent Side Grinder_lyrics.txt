3 ContributorsThis Is Us LyricsI wanna sit with you in a melting glove
And watch the fast few pieces fall to shreds
I wanna walk with you through a valium ring
And catch the new bright fires in the wind
If you run out of drugs
Run out of lives
Run out of hate
You turn to me
I'll turn to you
We're walking inside
Well this is here
This is now
Yeah this is us
I wanna speak with you in a silent way
And watch the new two hours of the day
I wanna ride with you in a final screen
And catch with your eyes only when it starts
When you run out of drugs
Run out of lives
Run out of hate
You turn to me
I'll turn to you
We're walking inside
Well this is here
This is now
Yeah this is us
You might also likeAs you run out of rage
Run out of life
Run out of hate
You turn to me
I'll turn to you
We're walking inside
Well this is here
This is now
As you run out of drugs
Run out of life
Run out of hate
You turn to me
I'll turn to you
We're walking inside
Well this is here
This is now
This is usEmbed
