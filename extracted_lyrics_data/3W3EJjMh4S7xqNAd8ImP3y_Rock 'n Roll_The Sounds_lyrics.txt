3 ContributorsRock ‘n’ Roll Suicide (Sounds Of The 70s: Bob Harris - recorded 23rd May 1972) Lyrics
This is my type of beat now

Time takes a cigarette, puts it in your mouth
You pull on your finger
Then another finger, then cigarette
The wall-to-wall is calling
It lingers, but still you forget

Oh, oh, oh, oh
You're a rock 'n' roll suicide

Too old to lose it but you're too young to choose it
And the clock waits so patiently on your song
Well, you walk past the café, but you don't eat
When you've lived too long

Oh, no, no, no
You're a rock 'n' roll suicide

Chev's brakes are snarling
As you stumble across the road
But the day breaks instead, so you hurry home
Don't let the sun blast your shadow
Don't let the milk float ride your mind
They're so natural, religiously unkind
You might also like
Oh no, love, you're not alone
You're watching yourself, but you're too unfair
You've got your head all tangled up
But if I could only make you care
Oh no, love, you're not alone
No matter what or who you've been
No matter when or where you've seen
All the knives seem to lacerate your brain
I've had my share, now I'll help you with the pain
You're not alone

Just turn on with me, and you're not alone
Give me your hands, 'cause you're wonderful
Just give your hands, 'cause you're wonderful (Wonderful)
Give me your hands, 'cause you're wonderful (Wonderful)
Oh, give me your handsEmbed
