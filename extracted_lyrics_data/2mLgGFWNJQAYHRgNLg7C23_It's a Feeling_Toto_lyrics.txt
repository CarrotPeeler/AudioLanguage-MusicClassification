I don't belong here
But man's on the outside looking in
Wonderin' whose in his old armchair
It's a feeling
You never belonged to me
First you're on the up and up
I only look down and see
Only look down and see
You're fighting me
You knew me, all desires
No lock or key can hide the truth
You're keeping from me
It's a feeling
I don't belong here
But man's on the outside looking in
Wonderin' whose in his old armchair
It's a feeling
You never belonged to me
First you're on the up and up
I only look down and see
Only look down and see

You knew me, all desires
No lock or key can hide the truth
You're keeping from me
It's a feeling
