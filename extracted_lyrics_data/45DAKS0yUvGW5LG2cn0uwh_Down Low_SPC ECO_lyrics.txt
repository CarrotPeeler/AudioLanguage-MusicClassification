1 ContributorDown Low Lyrics
Does it all revolve around money
Honey, Does it? How do I know?
Running, running on the down low

Ooh, you're not dead
Ooh, I've gone bad instead

Didn't want to say you are buried in the dark
Ain't nobody say you lied in your little words
I don't want to hear you cry about it, let it go
Once in my life I'm on a roll

In my head it's like a running road
In my eyes it's like I'm winning gold
Walk around you know it's like
In the middle of the night and I want it all
In the middle of I don't see you in the
Light anybody more
I don't wanna hear it all I don't know
Who do you think I'm playing for
Where in life can you see what it's for
You might also like
Ooh, you're not dead
Ooh, I've gone bad instead

Walk around you know it's like
In the middle of the night and I want it all
In the middle of I don't see you in the
Light anybody more
I don't wanna hear it all I don't know
Didn't want to say you're buried in the dark
Ain't nobody say you lied in your little words
I don't want to hear you cry about it, let it go
Once in my life I'm on a roll
Ooh, you're not dead
Ooh, you're not dead
Ooh, I've gone bad instead
Ooh, you're not deadEmbed
