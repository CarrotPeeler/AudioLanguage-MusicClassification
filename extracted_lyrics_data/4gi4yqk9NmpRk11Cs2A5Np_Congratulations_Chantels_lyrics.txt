Congratulations (Ayy, ayy, ayy)
It's the first day of your life (Ayy)
Oh no, oh no (Ayy, ayy)
I feel it in my heart
I feel it in my soul
The time is gettin' near
Just tell me when to go
Here I go
I'm packin' up my bags
I'm headed out the door
I'm never lookin' back (Ayy)
Yeah, yeah (Ayy, ayy)
I'm never lookin' back
This a celebration ('Bration)
This a celebration

So say goodbye to yesterday
The future's in front of you
Uh-huh, uh-huh, oh, yeah
There's no time to waste
Gon' get your money (Hey)
Go 'head and ball it up now (Hey)
Congratulations, you are ready for the rest of your life
The rest of your life (Hey)
The rest of your life
The rest of your life (Hey, hey)
See Chris Brown LiveGet tickets as low as $43You might also like
I've forgotten 'bout my past life
'Cause now I live the fast life
Pretty brain with a ass right
Shinin' like a flashlight
Plus I got my cash right
White girl but my tan nice
Bali, go from very nice
So damn hot, I can't lie
Highest level penthouse
Used to feel left out
Now I'm with the best crowd
Rockin' here with Chris Brown
Everybody get loud
You know how we get down
Haters need to sit down
Never gonna quit now
Here to make a statement
Just face it
While I take over
Flyer than a spaceship
Poppin' like a toaster (Oh)
Pretty little face with curves like a rollercoaster (Oh)
Celebrate it

So say goodbye to yesterday
The future's in front of you
Uh-huh, uh-huh, oh, yeah
There's no time to waste
Gon' get your money (Hey)
Go 'head and ball it up now (Hey)
Congratulations, you are ready for the rest of your life
The rest of your life (Hey)

The rest of your life (Hey, hey)
Yeah, look
Margiela on my wallet
You can't afford the profit
The hatin', used to stop it
'Cause the glasses here to stop it
I-I must be out my socket
I'm higher than a rocket
And my car is supersonic
Pooper scooper, that's poo-tonic
That's the shit, what that is?
Uh, that's just my ebonics
And haters never change, so I change up like the climates
Got that ha-ha shit
Huh, that shit make you vomit
Corn-fried rice, no Islamic
Just like at me Obama, oh (Oh)
Huh, hunnid, hunnid on my belt, man (Oh)
Flyer, call me sire 'cause I'm higher than a stealth man (Oh)
Ha, parachute, skydiver (This a celebration, 'bration)
Juicy in that GT, fuckin' up my tires, huh (This a celebration, 'bration)

So say goodbye to yesterday
The future's in front of you
Uh-huh, uh-huh, oh yeah
There's no time to waste
Gon' get your money
Go 'head and ball it up now
Congratulations, you are ready (Yeah) for the rest of your lifeEmbed
