Luanne, Luanne
Why do you run and hide?
Luanne, Luanne
Don't keep your love inside

I wait around for you after school
You slip away and I don't see you
Don't know what I'm gonna do
If you can't see how much I need you
We met, one day, and then, you ran away
I've searched the whole town looking for you
I know you're there somewhere

Luanne, Luanne
Why do you run and hide?
Luanne, Luanne
Don't keep your love inside

I write letters that I never send
I keep the words to whisper to you someday
I don't know where and I don't know when
Luanne, I'm gonna get to you some way
I want to feel your love so close to me
Give me just half a chance
To prove myself, I need to

Luanne, Luanne
Why do you run and hide?
Luanne, Luanne
Don't keep your love inside

These days true love is so hard to find
Someday, I know you're gonna be mine
Luanne, Luanne, Luanne, oh

Luanne (Luanne), Luanne (Luanne)
Why do you run and hide?
Luanne (Luanne), Luanne (Luanne)
Don't keep your love inside

Luanne, Luanne
No need to run and hide
Luanne, Luanne
Don't keep your love inside
Luanne (Luanne), Luanne (Luanne)
I wanna be beside you, can't you understand?
Luanne (Luanne), Luanne (Luanne)
Give me a little love, I know you can
Luanne, hey Luanne
Can't you hear me calling, Luanne?Embed
