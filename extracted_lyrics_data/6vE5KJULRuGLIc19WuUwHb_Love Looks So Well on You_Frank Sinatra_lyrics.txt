4 ContributorsLove Looks So Well On You LyricsLike moonlight looks on a country side, like a rose that's silvered with dew
Like sunlight looks on a meadow, love looks so well on you
Like children look on a carousel, all the joys they feel shining through
Like picnics look on a Sunday, love looks so well on you
It's bright as the starlight in your eyes, with stardust in your hair
And oh, that expression on your face, is one you should always wear
Everyday you grow even lovelier, yes, you do, my darling, you do
I love you every day of your life, cause love looks so well on youYou might also likeEmbed
