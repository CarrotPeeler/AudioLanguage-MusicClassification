21 ContributorsMelt Away Lyrics
You come to me with a casual flow
And suddenly my defenses start to go
When you talk to me in that sensual tone
It envelopes me and I lose my self control

And baby I just melt away
Fall like rain
Every time I see your face I go off (I go off)
I just want to break it down
Anytime you come around
Maybe I could melt away in your arms

Imagining that you're taking it slow
And so tenderly
'Till the feeling overflows
When you look at me I go soft and cave in
And I can't conceal that I'm slowly weakening

(Baby...)
And baby I just melt away
(I fall like rain)
Fall like rain
Every time I see your face I go off (I go off)
(Every time I see your face I lose my self control)
I just want to break it down
Anytime you come around
(And maybe I...)
Maybe I could melt away in your arms

You and me in a cloud of reverie
Spin around inside my head unendingly
(Over and over and over and over)
Thoughts run wild as I sit and rhapsodize
Paint pretty pictures of what I'd do if you were mine

(Baby I... fall)
And baby I just melt away
Fall like rain
Every time I see your face I go off (I go off)
(Every time I see your face I just go off)
I just want to break it down
(I just wanna break down)
Anytime you come around
Maybe I could melt away in your arms
(And maybe I could melt away... oh, your arms, your arms)

And baby I just melt away
Fall like rain (baby I fall)
Every time I see your face I go off (I go off)
(Yeah yeah yeah yeah, )
I just want to break it down
(You and me ain't got a typical thing)
Anytime you come around
(You and me ain't got a typical thing)
Maybe I could melt away in your arms
(And maybe I could melt away... in your arms)
And baby I just melt away
(And I...)
Fall like rain
(And I...)6Embed
