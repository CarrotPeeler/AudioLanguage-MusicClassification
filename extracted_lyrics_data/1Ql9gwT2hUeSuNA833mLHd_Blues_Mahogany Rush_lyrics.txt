Keep your eyes on the road, your hands upon the wheel
Yeah, we're goin' to the roadhouse
Gonna have a real
A good time
Yeah, back at the roadhouse they got some bungalows
Yeah, back at the roadhouse they got some bungalows
And that's for the people
Who like to go down slow
Let it roll, baby, roll
Let it roll, baby, roll
Let it roll, baby, roll
Let it roll, all night long
Do it, Robby, do it
You gotta roll, roll, roll
You gotta thrill my soul, all right
Roll, roll, roll, roll
To thrill my soul
You gotta beepa concha too chomp
Ko ko ko kah don-ta
Ate japoona may-jah
Bop a lula he-cho
Bop a mee-cho
He some funk, hey ride
Ashen lady, Ashen lady
Give up your vows, give up your vows
Save our city, save our city
Ah right now
When I woke up this morning, I got myself a beer
Well, I woke up this morning, and I got myself a beer
The future's uncertain, and the end is always near
Let it roll, baby, roll
Let it roll, baby, roll
Let it roll, baby, roll
Let it roll, ah, all night longYou might also likeEmbed
