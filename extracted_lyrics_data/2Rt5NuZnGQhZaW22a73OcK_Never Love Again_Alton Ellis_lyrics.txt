I can not forget the night I've met you
You gave me love in the morning
You stole my love in the evening
Now that you're gone, girl, I can't go onward without you

No, I'll never, never, never
And oh, I'll never, never, never
I'll never love again

I can not forget those tears I cry, girl
You gave me love in the morning
You stole my love in the evening
Now that you're gone, I can't go onward without you

I'll never, never, never
And oh, I'll never, never, never
I'll never love again

No, I can not forget those dreams I had, girl, no
Because of you I have stayed late
And now I've lost my date
Now that you're gone, girl, I can't go onward without you
You might also like
I'll never, never, never
Oh, I'll never, never, never
Girl, I'll never love again, I'll never love again (No I won't)
And I'll never love again (No, no, no)Embed
