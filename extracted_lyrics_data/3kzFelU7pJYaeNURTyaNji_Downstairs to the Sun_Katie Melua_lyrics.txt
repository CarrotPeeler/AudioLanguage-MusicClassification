2 ContributorsDownstairs to the Sun Lyrics
Can't say what came over me
I wasn't what I used to be
Hadn't seen how I lost control
And I always thought that I was strong

But one night, one situation
One sign, one devastation

I could have said no to the walk
Listened instead of just talked
And I dreamed that I had screamed
I could have run down the stairs to the sun

It's not what you did to me
It's the fact that I didn't fight you back
And it seems I had lost my voice
The one that always made the right choice

'Cause two nights, two situations
Two signs, two devastations

I could have said no to the walk
Listened instead of just talked
And I dreamed that I had screamed
I could have run down the stairs to the sun

But now the cup is no longer cold
As the rain trickles down I feel bold
And time is calling me to set myself free
Concession is the key and knowing what you don't see

I could have said no to the walk
Listened instead of just talked
And I dreamed that I had screamed
I could have run down the stairs to the sun

I could have run down the stairs to the sun
I could have run down the stairs to the sunEmbed
