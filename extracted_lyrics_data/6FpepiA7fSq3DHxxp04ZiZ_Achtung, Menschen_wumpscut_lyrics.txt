1 ContributorAchtung, Menschen LyricsOur duty here is over
Its' over over over
Army ridden roughshod over
Only here on sufferances
No more decoration glances
Achtung Menschen

Of poverty and broken ideals
We only lived from fowlest raw deals
See us go and watch the vans
See us go and watch the sign on
See us go and our plansYou might also likeEmbed
