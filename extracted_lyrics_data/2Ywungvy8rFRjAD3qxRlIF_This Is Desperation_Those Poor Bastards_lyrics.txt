1 ContributorThis Is Desperation LyricsPull up a chair crooked sinner
I see the blood stains
Covering your boots
And I see the scars covering your face
Do you feel the LORD's hands
Slowly clutching your throat?
Do you feel the DEVIL's claws
Tearing holes in your legs?
That's why you stumble when you walk
This is desperation
The only drug I've found
To ease the hurt are
