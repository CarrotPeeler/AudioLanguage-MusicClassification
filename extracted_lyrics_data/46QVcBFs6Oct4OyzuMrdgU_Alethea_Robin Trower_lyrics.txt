3 ContributorsAlethea Lyrics
I make life easy just by laughin'
I was the first to see the joke
When they said I'm afraid we are losing
Don't like the way you gave up hope

Alethea, Alethea
Don't let them put the blame on you
What seems so bad now
Could easily change for the better

Ooh I turned away from all that hurt me
Now just a faded memory
Get on the track sister baby
Love the love that wants to be

Alethea, Alethea
Don't let them put the blame on you
What seems so bad now
Could easily change for the better

Alethea, Alethea
Don't let them put the blame on you
What seems so bad now
Could easily change for the betterEmbed
