1 ContributorKetchup LyricsI gave some milk to a robot friend
It leaked out his side and he drank it again
Let's put your girlfriend through some hell
Cut off her hands and hide them well
Use worms to stich them back in place
Watch the expression on her face
I feel like I got caught in a gross cartoon
And I'm choking on the word balloons
I met a homeless astronaut
Helmet filled up with beer and snot
I gave him 30 candy bars
And told him to go back to Mars
Electric ketchup shocks my fries
C'mon guys, POKE OUT YOUR EYESYou might also likeEmbed
