Delusions of grandeur
The fools are romancers
Solutions and answers
To groove and to dance uh
The roof of the jail
Should be you with the land
Was a skew from the plan
This is tooth in the hand
Get ya crew, put ma man up
But the school was a scam
The movements are tantric
But the crews that you ran with
To prove with the candor
The conclusion you slander
The juice that we manage
Delusions of grandeur

There’s nothing you can do to the panther
You threw the tantrum who spit the mantra
Keep bluffing but you knew the dampers
Tude that you hampered
To move with your banter
We puff another bubonic sample
You blew the example and you took a handful
I knew you were stranded
The clue to be candid
The coolest new antics ain't cool with the family
You might also likePeople tell me my sound is terrific
From KRS-One to the brothers Hieroglyphics
They say he's got lungs to be keeping it uplifted
He's speaking in tongues of the truth with a finesse
He's smooth and relentless
Excuse me demented with the tools of a chemist
Bruised with the blemishes
Coolest of the gremlins
Groove with the innocence
Through with the limited and the stupid and the ignorant
Gimme a little hit
I'mma make a milli lil lick
I’m killing it and healing a lil bit
I’m just refusing to drink
I’m too legitimate to put it out of the pulpit with all the bullshit
Insignificant unless you are really mess with it
It’s disciplined,if it ever is, if left independent if any of the truth fits
Cruise it, produce it, move it
Delusions of grandeur
The future’s an average
Fools in the mansion
The twosome are prancin
Move through the zoo with the fence
We make music advances
A sleuth, a recluse, and the ransom
The new voodoo anthem
You can play the tandem
The midget and the bandam
From lemonade stand to the renegade plans
With the minute maid clan
Revolutionary groove With demands
Keep putting a Haiku on my hand
You break two piece of land
Here’s a cure for your cancer
It’s the fellowship crew with the camera
Zoom with the handlers
A zoo for the animals
Big biz coming through with the stamina
The view from the summoner, the true necromancer
But knew who put hands
Had the extra big hands from Texas
Cancer, the Peruvian Andes
Delusions of grandeur can take over when you're not sober
Delusions of grandeur can take over when you're high
People tell me my style is humongous
Hoppin up on it in London
To the land down under
Through the rain and thunder
With the pain and hunger
Entertainment wonder
Now who want to rumble
But ooh there’s a number
Barracuda for some
But the cuties and stunnas
Are clued to the money
It’s Bootsy and funky
Now who’s gonna wanna
Get more food for my tummy
It’s boomin and bumpin
Now lemme roll a lil bit up
I just want a lil bit in my cup
I figured there’d be liquor on my lip
So who took my chances, what up
Told somebody to nut up
And put tattood dude in a headlock
