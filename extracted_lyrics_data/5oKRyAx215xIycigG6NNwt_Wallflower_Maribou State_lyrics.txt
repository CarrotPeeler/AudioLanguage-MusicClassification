Without you, out you
Want me to do, and do do
And die for you
Anything you do, when you want me to
O-oh, oh, ow, you
And always you

Without you, out you
Want me to do, and do do
And die for you
Anything you do, when you want me to
O-oh, oh, ow, you
And always you

Without you, out you
Want me to do, and do do
And die for you
Anything you do, when you want me to
O-oh, oh, ow, you
And always you
