5 ContributorsEmbalmed LyricsEpidermis punctured
As the deadened blood is drawn
Stiff cadaver on the table
Victims of death's spawn
Desecrate, deteriorate
Start to decompose
Process of embalmment
Through your veins the chemicals flow
No more thoughts inside your head
Your brain is on a tray
Injection of formaldehyde
Organs have decayed
Light of day not to be seen
Again by the deceased
Rigor mortis is your future
Death ignored your pleas
Blood replaced by chemicals
No more life is found
Next stop is a wooden box
Rotting undergroundYou might also likeEmbed
