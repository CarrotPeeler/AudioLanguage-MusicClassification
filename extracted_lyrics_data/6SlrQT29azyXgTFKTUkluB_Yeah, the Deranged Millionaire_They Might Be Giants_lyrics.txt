He had an unlikely name
Yeah, the Deranged Millionaire
The Deranged Millionaire
He lived in a secret location
Burning money all day
And people from miles around were miles away
He had a name
He had an unlikely name
Yes, the Deranged Millionaire
The Deranged Millionaire
Gold is diamond-encrusted
And diamonds are covered in gold
He lost a lot of money betting on the genome of bats
With echolocation, you've always gotta go with the bats
He had a name
He had an unlikely name
He had a name
He had an unlikely nameSee They Might Be Giants LiveGet tickets as low as $52You might also likeEmbed
