Bad, bad whiskey
Bad, bad whiskey
Made me lose my happy home
Made me lose my happy home
Whiskey endless women
Is driving me out of my mind
Ev'ry time I get a lover that's tough you know
I think I'm doin' just fine
Bad, bad whiskey
Bad, bad whiskey
Bad, bad whiskey
Made me lose my happy home
Made me lose my happy home
I went out last night
Finally knocked myself outta sight
I got full of that bad stuff
And almost started a fight
Bad, bad whiskey
Bad, bad whiskey
Bad, bad whiskey
Made me lose my happy home
Made me lose my happy home
You might also likeI wanna tell you baby
I'm now feeling just fine
I think I'll stop drinking whiskey
And going back to bad wine
Bad, bad whiskey
Bad, bad whiskey
Bad, bad whiskey
Made me lose my happy home
Made me lose my happy home
Let me tell you
Oh, that bad whiskey
Oh, that bad whiskey
Oh, that no good whiskeyEmbed
