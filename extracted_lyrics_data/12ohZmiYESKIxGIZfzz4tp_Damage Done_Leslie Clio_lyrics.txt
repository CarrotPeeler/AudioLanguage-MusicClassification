1 ContributorDamage done Lyrics
We used to be so in love
Now it's just tearing us up
You had my whole heart beating
But turned it off
We were working so hard
But we are running so dry
The very sight of it all
Has got me wondering
Why we could go so wrong
We could go so wrong

We used to be so in love
Now you're just pissing me off
You had my whole world spinning
But turned it off
Why is it so hard
You really knew me so well but see how time flies
We've got so little to tell
And we got no one else to blame

Remember we stood out in the rain - hold on
Thinking we'll never be the same - hold on
Now it's hard to believe how far we've come
No going back, nowhere else to run
But I run and I run
Now that the damage is done
You might also like
Damage done, damage done, damage done
Damage done, damage done, damage done

We used to be so in love
Now we have fallen apart
How come you let go
Instead of using your heart
Why can't we just be
And just forget what we've done
Can hear my heart break
Baby you just lost one
And we got no one else to blame

Remember we stood out in the rain - hold on
Thinking we'll never be the same - hold on
Now it's hard to believe how far we've come
No going back, nowhere else to run
But I run and I run
Now that the damage is done

Damage done, damage done, damage done
Damage done, damage done, damage done
Damage done, damage done, damage done
Damage done, damage done, damage done
Remember we stood out in the rain - hold on
Thinking we'll never be the same - hold on
Now it's hard to believe how far we've come
No going back, nowhere else to run
But I run and I run
Now that the damage is doneEmbed
