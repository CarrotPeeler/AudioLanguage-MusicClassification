1 ContributorA Song for Harry Chapin LyricsI got out of bed in a foggy day
I drove my car on the motorway
To the airport for a trans-Atlantic plane
While checking in he was on my mind
From another place, another time
And he showed me how to dream in other ways
The image that my mind could see
Was his stories, and his charities
And the passion when I hear him sing his songs
At times the details seemed absurd
But he had me hanging on every word
Of how the world to him was right or wrong
He opened up my eyes to a new style of song
Like a book or like a movie, and it lasted just as long
I followed every word he’d say, his songs blew my mind away
The world should hear his name and share his love
The day that I discovered him
I was singing and the lights were dim
When a stranger came to me and said his name
I swore that I would check to see
With the money that he gave to me
And now my life can never be the same
‘Cause, he opened up my eyes to a new style of song
Like a book or like a movie, and it lasted just as long
I followed every word he’d say, his songs blew my mind away
The world should hear his name and share his love
He was born in 1942, New York City, a place he knew so well
He would sing his songs about folk he knew
And he’d make you feel like you knew them too
Like, you knew them too
And he gave he a poor damn fool, such a better place to be
Somewhere in his morning sunshine
He would never let his dreams go by
As he looked the world straight in the eye
And you’d always find him in the same old way
If you met him any time of day
Any time of day
And instead he gave some fool, such a better place to be
Somewhere in his morning sunshine
Ah, the cheating mayor will still deny
The son who’d caught the daughter’s eye
And the baritone who took his shot
Using all he’d save, and he’d lose a lot
Give it all he got
But somewhere in his heart
He’d find that same old place
Somewhere in his morning sunshine
Sunshine
It was on a Thursday, mid-July
He got into his car to drive
The gods had chose to throw his final dice
He was off to Eisenhower Park
To Place Meadow in New York
The Long Island Express way took his life
Harry took his final breath
The world will live with Harry’s death
Still the genius of his work in songs unfurl
He was a man who took his time on Earth
Proving what his life was worth
To find out what would happened to this world
Now we’re left with the stories of his life
As he drives his taxi to the skies
No more planes to catch, no bills to pay
He was a troubadour from America
A visionary who touched the stars
Now his morning sunshine’s gone away
He took his morning sunshine awayYou might also likeEmbed
