Mother Mary was my friend
She put a gun right in my hand
I fired it once and shot her son
So it said my time would come

Ugly, you want to be
Suicidal, just like me
Ugly, you want to be
Suicidal

I saw God and he said to me
Take a family of four and make it three
Charlie, Ted and the son of Sam
They all ate green eggs and ham

Ugly, you want to be
Suicidal, just like me
Ugly, you want to be
Suicidal

I saw God and he said to me
Take a family of four and make it three
Charlie, Ted and the son of Sam
They all ate green eggs and ham
You might also like
Ugly, you want to be
Suicidal, just like me
Ugly, you want to
Suicidal, suicidal

Ugly, you want to be
Ugly, so k'in
Ugly, you gotta be
Ugly, your mother's
Ugly
Ugly
Ugly
