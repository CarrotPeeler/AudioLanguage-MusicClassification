1 ContributorSandwiches LyricsI know you wanna do it
You know I wanna do it too
Out here on the dance floor
We can make sandwiches
You can be the bun
And I can be the burger girl
I know you wanna do it
We can make sandwiches
So make your thighs like butter, easy to spread
And we can make sandwiches
Out here on the dance floor
Come on we can do it
We can make sandwiches
(repeats 5 times)
