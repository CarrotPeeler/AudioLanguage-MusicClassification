3 ContributorsBlack No. 1 (Little Miss Scare-All) (Edit) LyricsShe's in love with herself
She likes the dark
On her milk-white neck
The Devil's mark
Now it's All Hallows Eve
The moon is full
Will she trick or treat?
I bet she will
She's got a date at midnight
With Nosferatu
Oh baby, Lily Munster
Ain't got nothing on you
Well, when I called her evil
She just laughed
Well, cast that spell on me
Boo bitch-craft
Yeah, you wanna go out 'cause it's raining and blowing
You can't go out 'cause your roots are showing
Dye 'em black
Ooh, dye 'em black
Black, black, black, black number one
(She dies 'em black)
Black, black, black, black number one
(Black number one)

Lovin' you
Love, lovin' you
Was like lovin' the dead
It was like lovin' the dead!
Loving you was like loving the dead
Loving you was like loving the dead
Loving you was like loving the dead
Was like loving the dead
Was like loving the dead
Was like loving the dead
Black, black, black, black number one
(She dyes 'em black)
Black, black, black, black number one
(Black number one)
Black, black, black, black number one
Black, black, black, black number one
Black, black, black, black number one
