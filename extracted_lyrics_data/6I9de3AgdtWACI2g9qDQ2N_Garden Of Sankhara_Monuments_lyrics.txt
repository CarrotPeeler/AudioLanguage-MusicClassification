7 ContributorsGarden of Sankhara Lyrics
There is death in the air everywhere around me
Through the night, I won't make it anymore

But I forget that I couldn't make all the same bad mistakes
Like the ways of the ancients, everything has to change
I would do anything to remove and erase
Just tell me now face to face who wouldn't take my place

Wait, are you the golden light?
I'll make you sure about it
Wait, are you the sound of time?
I am the one they name!

You know the mess that awaits in me
I dare to see you there
A better soul that you made of me, yeah
They’re dancing on your fucking death

I'm moving through a place that I can't reshape, these goddamn vines
Alone, on your own, you will fall
I'm moving through a place that I can’t escape, I hope they let me stay alive
Alone, on your own, you will fall
You might also like
And I forget that I couldn't make all the same bad mistakes
Like the ways of the ancients, everything has to change
I would do anything to remove and escape
Just tell me now, face to face, who would you dare to bring
Back to me?

Who's in the mirror that I'm meant to see?
In-between the misty state of this waking dream
And we're standing at the fall
What reflects will lead the way
What reflects will lead the way

Wait, are you the golden light?
I'll make you sure about it
Wait, are you the sound of time?
They'll make you sure to doubt it
Destiny, a hollow guest that a patient sees
Or are you really there?
Wait, are you the sound of life?
I am the one they name!

You know the mess that awaits in me
I dare to see you there
A better soul that you made of me
They're dancing on your fucking deathEmbed
