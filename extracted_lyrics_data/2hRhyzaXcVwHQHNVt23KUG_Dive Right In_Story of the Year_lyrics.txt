6 ContributorsDive Right In LyricsSo here I go
I'll dive right in
Break through the waves
Straight to the ocean floor
And although my hands are shaking
I lie perfectly still
'Cause I'm determined to let myself sink down
And I know I'm buried too far down
To feel the warmth from the sun again
I could wave my arms and swim away
But never reach the shore
But for now I will lay face first in the sand
With the wreckage from ships that lost their way
And I know I'm buried too far down
To feel the warmth from the sun again
And I know I'm buried too far down
To feel the warmth from the sun again
And although my hands are shaking
I lie perfectly still
'Cause I'm determined to let myself sink down
And I know I'm buried too far down
To feel the warmth from the sun againYou might also likeEmbed
