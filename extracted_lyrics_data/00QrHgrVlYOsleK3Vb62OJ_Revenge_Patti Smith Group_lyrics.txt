7 ContributorsRevenge LyricsI feel upset. Let's do some celebrating
Come on honey don't hesitate now
Needed you. You withdrew. I was so forsaken
Ah, but now the tables have turned. My move
I believe I'll be taking my revenge. Sweet revenge
I thought you were some perfect read-out Some digital delay
Had obscured and phased my view of the wicked hand you played
The sands and hands of time have run out. Run out
You better face it this thing's run amok. This luck
I do know how to replace it with revenge. Sweet revenge
I gave you a wristwatch baby
You wouldn't even give me the time of day
You want to know what makes me tick
Now it's me that's got precious little to say
For the ghosts of our love have dried have died
There's no use faking it
The spirits going to close in on you tonight
High time I was taking my revenge
Sweet revenge. Revenge. Revenge
All the gold and silver couldn't measure
Up my love for you. It's so immaterial
I wouldn't wait around if I were you
In the valley of the wait-ting ting
Nobody get's nothing. Nobody gets anything
No time for kisses
Don't leave me no space in your little boat
You ain't going to need, no you ain't going to need no little boat
You are living on marked time my dear. Revenge. Sweet revenge
Sweet, sweet revengeYou might also likeEmbed
