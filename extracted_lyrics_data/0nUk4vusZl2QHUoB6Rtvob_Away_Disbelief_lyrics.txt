2 ContributorsAway LyricsNow - now - now
Now i'm looking back
Fear of life, in my head I grow
Lost it all, dreams they wait
Now - now - now
Now I can't crasp it
The tears will try
Try to hide
To help me
Away - away - away
Now you're so far away
So far away
Can I have confidence in love
All I gave is not enough
The hour feel the time
No hope
Now I'm still alive
Now - now - now
All is drifting away
You might also likeTears will try
Try to hide
To help me by myside
Away - away - away
Now you're so far away
So far away
Now I've doubts
If the needs for safety
Emotions fly
Pay living them
Is not enough
Be hidden feelings shown reserved
Trust eat them
Use of confidenceEmbed
