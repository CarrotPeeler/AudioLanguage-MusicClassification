1 ContributorWail LyricsDo it again!
I got the key to my mind
I'm doin' crazy things
Every year it's been mine to win
Got to blast, quiver
Gonna bust a gut
I'm always ready
Try to put it right there and get up
Sexy, funky
Get down
Got to get all the way
You got to help me
Wail, wail, wail
I wish I was funky alright
Fank in the back of it
Tried to get a kiss
Tried to get to hug you
You got to hug, kiss, hug
Baby, got the bug
I'm always a few minutes wrong
You got to put me right there
And knock it down
Come on, lover
I got to go all the way up town
Check it out
Rock me
I'm alone
You got to help me
You might also likeWail, wail, wail
Funky time
I'm doin' the monkey now
I'm always a few minutes wrong
You got to put me right there
Come on, baby
Sock it to me
You got to get it
Wail, wail baby, wail I'm always a few minutes wrong (4 times)Embed
