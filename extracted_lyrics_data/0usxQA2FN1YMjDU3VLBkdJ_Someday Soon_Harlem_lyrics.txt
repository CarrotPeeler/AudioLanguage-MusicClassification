4 ContributorsSomeday Soon Lyrics
Someday soon you'll be on fire
And you'll ask me for a glass of water
And I'll say, "No, you can just let that shit burn"
And you'll say

"Please, please, please put me out
I promise not to do it again, whatever I did to you
Oh, please, please, please put me out
I promise not to do it again, whatever I did to you

Oh please put me out!
I promise not to do it again!
Oh, please put me out!
I promise not to do it again!"

Who you lying to, darlin'? 'Cuz you can't lie to me
And even he can't tell that's a suitcase between your knees
Oh I believe that somebody had to leave
But God almighty, it couldn't be me!

And you'll say
"Please put me out!
I promise not to do it again!
Oh, please put me out!
I promise not to do it again"You might also likeEmbed
