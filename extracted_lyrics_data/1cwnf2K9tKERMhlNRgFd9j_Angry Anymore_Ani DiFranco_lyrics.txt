4 ContributorsAngry Anymore LyricsGrowing up, it was just me and my mom against the world
And all my sympathies were with her when I was a little girl
Now I've seen both my parents play out the hands that they were dealt
As each year goes by I know more about how my father must have felt
I just want you to understand
That I know what all the fighting was for
And I just want you to understand
That I'm not angry anymore
No I'm not angry anymore
She taught me how to wage a cold war with quiet charm
But I just want to walk through my life unarmed
To accept and just get by like my father learned to do
But without all the acceptance and getting by that got my father through
I just want you to understand
That I know what all the fighting was for
And I just want you to understand
That I'm not angry anymore
No I'm not angry anymore
Night falls like people into love
We generate our own light to compensate
For the lack of light from above
And every time we fight a cold wind blows our way
But we can learn like the trees how to bend
How to sway and say

What all this fighting is for
And baby, I just want you to understand
That I'm not angry anymore
No I'm not angry anymoreEmbed
