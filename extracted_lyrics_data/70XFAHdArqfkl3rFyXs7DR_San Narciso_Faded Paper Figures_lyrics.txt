2 ContributorsSan Narciso Lyrics
Out to sea we hear
Los Angeles calling
Each one of us falling
Into vorticist dreams
In the air you see
The city cells sprawling
Like circuits installing
These silicon dreams
Oh, I run out of mind inside
And so go out to find you
But then something reminds you

Oh San Narciso shines
From sea to sea
The message we're sending
We want to believe
Oh concentrate
And watch us move the sea
Entropically trending
But we want to believe
Yeah, we want to believe
You might also like
I can work the phones
To sort out these demons
With some formal agreements
Or you could let down your hair
I can feel your pulse
Break free from surveillance
Now it's the last thing that makes sense
The only reason I care
Oh, I ran out of mind inside
And so I'm coming to find you
Before something reminds you

Oh San Narciso shines
From sea to sea
The message we're sending
We want to believe
Oh concentrate
And watch us move the sea
Entropically trending
But we want to believe
Yeah, we want to believeEmbed
