I didn't really mean to cause you pain
So if you want I will cover you with kisses
And I will be your slave again
I need your love and understanding baby
But you changed the lock on your front door
If you want I will cover you with roses
I want to be your slave again
I want to be your
I want to be your
I want to be your slave slave
You know I'm getting tired of back door loving
You give me all my heart desires
Lord have mercy when I slipped and fell and I broke your heart
I want to be your slave again
If you want I will cover you with kisses
Sweet surrender to your touch
If you want take all I give
I want to be your slave
I want to be your slave again
I want to be your slave baby

Stacking roses around your front door
I miss your love I miss your loving touch now mama
I want to be your slave againEmbed
