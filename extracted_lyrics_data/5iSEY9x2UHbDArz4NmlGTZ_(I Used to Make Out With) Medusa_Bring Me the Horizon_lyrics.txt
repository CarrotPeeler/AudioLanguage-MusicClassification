34 Contributors(I Used To Make Out With) Medusa Lyrics
Dead hands clutch my arm, the smell of death fills the air
Her fragrance, a carcass reanimates
Oh, if you need me, I'll be tying a rope to the tree
Where our, where our love used to be
I took down every photo of us and buried them at sea
I took down every photo and I buried them at sea
Don't worry, pretty, beauty is only skin deep
(Psyche!)

Your beauty is no more
So why don't you just fuck yourself, you fucking whore
Oh, your beauty is no, no more
So why don't you just fuck yourself, you stupid fucking whore

I should have known
Not to look into her eyes
I'm cast to stone (I'm cast to stone)
Her glare was my demise
Medusa, Medusa, oh

Your beauty is no, no more
So why don't you just fuck yourself, you fucking whore
You might also like
Dead hands clutch my arm, the smell of death, it fills the air
Her fragrance, a carcass reanimates
(Since you left me) I've never
(Since you left me) Been the same
(Since you left me) I've never
(Since you left me) Been the fucking same


Hour by hour, day by day
Your memory will fade away
Every sunrise, every sunset
Will help me to forget your name
Your smile, your eyes, Medusa

Decapitate her and bring her head to Athena
Unlike her sisters, she ain't no deathless God, oh
This is for every time you stabbed me in the back
Every notch in your bedpost
This is for every time you stabbed me in the back
For every notch in your bedpost, baby9Embed
