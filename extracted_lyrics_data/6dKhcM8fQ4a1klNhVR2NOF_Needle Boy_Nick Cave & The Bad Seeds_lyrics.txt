5 ContributorsNeedle Boy Lyrics
At the turn of the century I did many things to protect myself
I did many things to protect myself
I made myself a needle-boy
And I hid him in the closet
And I made myself a money-man
And I hid him underneath the mattress
And I made myself a spider-child
And I put him in a matchbox
And I forged myself a golden statuette
And I wrapped him in a Hello! magazine
And I hid him in a wall safe
And, finally, I made myself a spade-girl
And I put her in a garden shed
All to protect myself, you see
From the demon that was coming from the east
Or from the west
And then I sat on the rooftop and I waited

And when at last the demon came
From the east or from the west
And awoke me from my sleep
And awoke me to a particular point of view
And the needle-boy stuck him in the eye
And the money-man choked him with coins
The spider-child bit him on the ankle
And the statuette crashed down upon his head
And the spade-girl buried him underneath the house
And I danced on the rooftops
And I danced on the rooftops
And I danced to the western world
And I danced to the western worldSee Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds LiveGet tickets as low as $60You might also likeEmbed
