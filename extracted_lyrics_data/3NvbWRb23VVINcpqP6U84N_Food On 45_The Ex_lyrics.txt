1 ContributorFood on 45 LyricsI've bought the latest workout album
Totally revised for the next slim-craze
I bought the album, the book and the outfit
When will I start to lose some weight
I wanna look like my favourite models
I'm on several diets to slim more
I even do the exercises day after day after day
Still my fat won't go away
I watch myself and I watch my weight
I watch my fridge and my empty plate
Where there's a will there must be a way
While my wallet suffers from the slim-craze
Sometimes I wish to live in the poor man's wealth
No slimming problems ever when we tighten his belt
He never worries, there's no rub
He can't afford to pay a visit to our fitness-club
Are you fit enough to get fat
Well, I'm fat enough to get fit
But I just don't succeed
To slim the slightest bit
Just put yourself in my place
I know you can, try it
Then I'll eat your brains for breakfast
Because I'm on a diet
You might also likeI watch myself and I watch my weight
I watch my fridge and my empty plate
They give me some food for thought
I'm a fed-up fathead in a slim-craze
I've never been on a diet
I never really had to slim
All this fighting and rioting
Keeps me in trim
White diet
I wanna diet
White diet
I diet of my own
God save the beans
Brown, white and green
There ain't no foodshops
In England's dream
And I don't careEmbed
