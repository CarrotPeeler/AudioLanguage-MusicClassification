3 ContributorsOnly To Be With You Lyrics
I used to live my life just fast and free, and do as I feel
Right down to the bone I was a rolling stone, just wanna be free
But now I think I just might be a little more than slightly changing my views
This is a far cry from what I've known, cause all I know, I want

Only to be with you
'Cause through and through
I'm just a freak for you

Nobody's made me want to stay this long, the way that you do
Turn your love on and I feel I'm reborn, I always want you
Sometimes I feel like hey no this can't be right, this cannot be real
I've seen love come and I've seen it go, but all I know, I want

Only to be with you
'Cause through and through
I'm just a freak for you
Only to be with you
'Cause through and through
Girl I believe in you

Sometimes I feel like hey no this cannot be right, this cannot be real
And I feel like I've seen the light, 'cause all I know that I want
You might also like
Only to be with you
'Cause through and through
I'm just a freak for you
Only to be with you
'Cause through and through
Girl I believe in you

Do you know what I'm talking about
Make my world go round, around
Only, only, only, only
Only, only
Only, only, only, yeah

Only to be with you
I'm just a freak for you
C-come on baby, baby, baby
Only to be with you
I can't help it, I'm a freak for you, baby
Only, only
Only to be with you
Yeah I, I'm just a freak for you
Yeah, I can't lie, gotta give it a try now, baby...Embed
