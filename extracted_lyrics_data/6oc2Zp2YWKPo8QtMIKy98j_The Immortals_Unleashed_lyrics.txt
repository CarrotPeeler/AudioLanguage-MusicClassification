2 ContributorsThe Immortals LyricsRise - my armies - with power - from hell
We march...
When all their power's gone
And nothing's left but shame
We are the evil ones, a pestilence they say
We tear their souls apart by just being what we are
...And to forever be the ones to blame
There's nothing here for us
In their world of love and trust
We vomit in their eyes and face them with disgust
We are the tyrants of the darkness as they say
And we will never obey
Rise - my armies - with power - from hell
We march...
We leave your god behind, he's shaking with fright
See the hatred in our eyes shining so bright
Possessed by hell itself we stand up to charge
And rise from the flames
This is the time for vengeance
Now their end is near
We strike with hateful power, we have no fear
We are the immortals of a never ending race
And we shall fight 'til the end
You might also likeNow the time has come
For all the fools to pray
Come on, face the slayer
Now's your time to pay
Rise - my armies - with power - and might
We slay...Embed
