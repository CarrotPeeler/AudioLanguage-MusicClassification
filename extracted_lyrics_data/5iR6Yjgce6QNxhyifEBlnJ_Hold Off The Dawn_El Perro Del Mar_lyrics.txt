To hold off the dawn
Stay away, away, away, away
To hold off the dawn
Stay away, away, away, away
When all hope is gone
Stare away, away, away, away
To hold back the dawn
No need to talk about the future baby
We don’t need to talk about that
All I need to know is about you and me baby
Can we make a new past
If we run away, away, away, run away
From the day, the day, the day, from the day
Stay away, away, away, away
To hold off the dawn
Stay away, away, away, away
To hold off the dawn
Stare away, away, away, away
When all hope is gone
Stay away, away, away, away
To hold back the dawn
Comes another day
You're going nowhere
It's just another day
To go nowhere
Ain't no need to talk about the future baby
We don’t need to talk like that
All I need to know is about you and me baby
Can we make a better past
If we run away, away, away, run away
From the day, the day, the day, from the day
Stay away, away, away, away
To hold off the dawn
Stay away, away, away, away
To hold off the dawn
Stay away, away, away, away
When all hope is gone
Stare away, away, away, away
To hold back the dawn
Comes another day
Just go nowhere
It's just another day
To go nowhere
Comes another day
Just go nowhere
It's just another day
To go nowhere
Ain't no need to talk about the future baby
We don’t need to talk like that
All I need to know is about you and me baby
Can we make a new past
If we run awayYou might also likeEmbed
