Love me dear, an' I'll be true
And all I want for you to say
Is you'll come home with me each day
You could be my love
That's what I want
Just you, secure and safe from harm
It's just like me, to feel so good
And fall so much, in love with you
It's just like me, It's just like me
I'm not your fool, that's what I'll be
It's just like you, to say goodbye
And leave me all alone to cry
It's just like me, to say to you
Love me dear, an' I'll be true
And all I want for you to say
Is you'll come home with me each day
It's just like me, It's just like me
I'm not your fool, that's what I'll be
It's just like you, to say goodbye
And leave me all alone I cry
It's just like me
It's just like you
It's just like me
It's just like you
It's just like me
It's just like you
It's just like me
It's just like you
