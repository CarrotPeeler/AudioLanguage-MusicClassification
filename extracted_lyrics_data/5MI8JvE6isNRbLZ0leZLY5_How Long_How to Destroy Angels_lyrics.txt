How long?

Always been here
It almost seems like yesterday
Hard to picture
It's the little things that slip away
Built with blisters
But they find a way to take a little bit
They won't find us
If you believe in it
If you believe in it

How long?
How long?
Can we keep holding on
How long?
How long?
Can we keep holding on

A house on fire
Burning all the past away
And what defines us, well
It's the little things that slip away
And if you're honest
What do you think would happen if
We stood for something
If you believe in it
Keep believing it, well
You might also like
How long? (Burn this all away)
How long? (Burn this all)
Can we keep holding on
How long? (You keep holding on and on)
How long? (Can we keep, can we keep)
Can we keep holding on
How long?1Embed
