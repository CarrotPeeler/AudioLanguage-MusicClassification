7 ContributorsInto The Black Hole Lyrics
A dark sphere surrounds us (Surreal, oblivious)
In the centre of the galaxy
A hidden force has found us (Powerful, mysterious)
At the boundary of eternity
Nothing escapes, not even light
Beyond the mystical horizon
We surrender to its might
Gazing into the eye of the universe
A deep roar is sounding (Deafening, thunderous)
As if the universe were crying
My heart is pounding (Frantic, delirious)
My every nerve is dying
Nothing escapes, not even light
Beyond the mystical horizon
We surrender to its might
Gazing into the eye of the universe

I hear screams of fallen souls, sad cries of agony
Within the void of this evil hole, deep inside the black
Could it be my imagination, the mirror of my fantasy?
A fear-induced hallucination
Or is there no way back from the halo of darkness?
You might also likeSpirits, apparitions, misery, suffering
Horrid dreams and dire visions rising up from the black
Look away in disbelief, this cannot be happening
The end has come, I bow in grief
There is no way back from the halo of darkness

Now silence devours us (Massive, suffocating)
The calm before the storm
Gravity overpowers us (Invincible, dominating)
And leads us through the final door
Nothing escapes, not even light
Beyond the mystical horizon
We surrender to its might
Gazing into the eye of the universe
Feed me light, I'm the halo of darkness
Feel my might, I'm the eye of the universe
Feed me light, I'm the halo of darkness
Feel my might, I'm the eye of the universe
Feed me light, I'm the halo of darkness
Feed me light, I'm the halo of darkness
Feed me light, I'm the halo of darkness
Feed me light, I'm the halo of darknessEmbed
