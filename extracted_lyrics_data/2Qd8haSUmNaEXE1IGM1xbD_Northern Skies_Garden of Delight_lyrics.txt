Floating with the soulwinds of lies
Into the northern skies
A thousand black clouds storm
Forbitten rites
To blind my eyes
Hiding from tomorrow
And hades wrapped in clouds
Ride the breeze
So cold as ice
The faithful, the fallen
Have faith to the ones with pride
The faithful, the fallen
And glance of day will never shine
As i can see
Truth, lies, and in between
Just a chaos fight
My soul enthroned on blackest stone
My heaven
Of glory bright
Hiding from tomorrow
And hades wrapped in clouds
Ride the breeze
So cold as ice
The faithful, the fallen
Have faith to the ones with pride
The faithful, the fallen
And glance of say will never shineYou might also likeEmbed
