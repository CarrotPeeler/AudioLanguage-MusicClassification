Lion from the north appear in the dark nation
Löwe aus der Mitternacht
Tear down the curtain of Paroketh
Ecce vicit Ariel
Break the seal and make the Lion rise
When Man has found all the three treasures
Stars will fall, the Lion will rise
Ariel, break the seventh seal
Abaddon, rise from the great black sea
Read the forecast - Fear the Eagle
See the wonders - Trust the Lion
Read the prophecy, the saviour of midnight
Ascending right now to bring us Borean light
Löwe aus der Mitternacht
Tear down the curtain of Paroketh
Ecce vicit Ariel
Break the seal and make the Lion rise
When Man has found all the three treasures
Stars will fall, the Lion will rise
Ariel, break the seventh seal
Abaddon, rise from the great black seaYou might also likeEmbed
