1 ContributorIâ€™m From Jersey Lyrics
Scene 1: Ample; Take 1
Let me tell you where I'm from
I'm from Jersey
What the hell is that shit?

Yeah, I was raised to drink forty, smoke weed, and punch bitches
Listen to heavy metal, chill 'til the cops mention
Cars with suspension and broads with fake tits
Craps game on the corner while I polish this fifth
I don't work, I'm doing everything my way
Drunk all day, Monday through Friday
If you want it I ain't got it, if you have it I'ma rob it
I'm a real piece of shit, tell it to my problems
Six kids, fuck a child support
Take me to court, give me it short
I thought you knew I was poor?
What you doing with a fella like me?
I fucked all your ugly friends in the back of my Jeep
I'm an asshole and I drink too much
Cut you off while I'm driving, flip the finger up
Yeah, I'm the guy your mother warned you about
Twenty-five years old, haven't left the house

I'm from Jersey, the land of the ignorant
Catch me at the bar acting belligerent
I'm from Jersey, the land of the ignorant
Catch me at the bar acting belligerent
I'm from Jersey, the land of the ignorant
Catch me at the bar acting belligerent
I'm from Jersey, the land of the ignorant
Catch me at the bar acting belligerent
I'm-

I'm Bam Bam Bigelow on the track, Maxxx been repping Jersey
Third state in the Union, these bitches ain't worthy
I be with the homies on the corner getting shermy
Best believe that we earned the nickname Dirty
Got the spots where you've been paying for two and they serve three
Yeah, it's dirt, weed, and crack rocks, I don't give a fuck
Georgia King Village on that ass, go on and give it up
I'm as Jersey as a point-two with some piff and a Dutch
Newark, Atlantic City, to state park, Paterson
Trenton, Camden, Jersey City, even Manalapan
It doesn't matter, stages or the streets homie, we down to get it
Battling, I bet it goes viral when I bang a chick
Home of Redman, home of many blue and red clans
Where if they catch you tripping then you a dead man
Weird New Jersey is in my heart and in my head fam
You disrespect it, I'm Tony Soprano with the lead

I'm from Jersey, the land of the ignorant
Catch me at the bar acting belligerent
I'm from Jersey, the land of the ignorant
Catch me at the bar acting belligerent
I'm from Jersey, the land of the ignorant
Catch me at the bar acting belligerent
I'm from Jersey, the land of the ignorant
Catch me at the bar acting belligerent
I'm-
Yeah, I'm from the Garden State where you can get a date
And get blown the same night, so keep your penis shaved
I'm from the land where the ignorance dwells
And nobody speaks English, girls are fucking at twelve
Indians pump your gas, but the curry, it smells
Rent's overpriced and public schools are hotter than hell
This is my homeland where the bums will beg you for change
And the Mexicans cut your grass as long as you pay
Let's get a few things clear, we don't fist pump, we get drunk
And fuck 'til the sun comes up, so come and get some
This is the life I love, so, tell me where y'all from

If you're from Jersey put your hands up
Put your hands up, put your hands up
If you're from Jersey put your hands up
Put your hands up cuz

I'm from Jersey, the land of the ignorant
Catch me at the bar acting belligerent
I'm from Jersey, the land of the ignorant
Catch me at the bar acting belligerent
I'm from Jersey, the land of the ignorant
Catch me at the bar acting belligerent
I'm from Jersey, the land of the ignorant
Catch me at the bar acting belligerent
I'm from JerseyEmbed
