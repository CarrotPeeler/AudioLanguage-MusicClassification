I've never felt so broken and alone
I'll let the sky swallow me whole
As I head out on my own
I stare down at the city lights
I spread my arms and claimed it mine
Bravely scream for the world to see
That I'm not afraid to dream
Bring me home
I've never felt so broken and alone
I'll let the sky swallow me whole
As I head out on my own
Deaf ears scream through the sleepless nights
As I battled with the time
Farewell to all the things I knew and all the things I left behind
Bring me home
I've never felt so broken and alone
I'll let the sky swallow me whole
As I head out on my own
Bring me home
I've never felt so broken and alone
I'll let the sky swallow me whole
As I head out on my own
