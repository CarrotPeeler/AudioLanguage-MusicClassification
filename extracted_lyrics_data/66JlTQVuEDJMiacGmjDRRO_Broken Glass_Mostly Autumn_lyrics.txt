1 ContributorBroken Glass LyricsUntil the end
Foreign footsteps crashing down
On everything I should have been
Lord how will it end?
The ways the ins the outs
A bright light shining from a child
I can't tell
If the rain goes up or down
Anymore
I left my dreams in broken glass
The foreign scent of loneliness
Silent sorrow now
I'm running just as hard as I can
Giving everything I have
Everything that's left inside
Until the end
I try to fall in love
The wind just blows my heart
From side to side
And I'm falling in
I can see no way out
Nobody can reach me now
You might also likeI can't tell
If the sun goes up or down
Anymore
I left my dreams in broken glass
The foreign scent of loneliness
Silent sorrow now
I'm running just as hard as I can
Giving everything I have
Everything that's left inside
I left my dreams in broken glass
The foreign scent of loneliness
No more sorrow now
I'm running but I just can't reach them
All the loneliness
The only thing that's left insideEmbed
