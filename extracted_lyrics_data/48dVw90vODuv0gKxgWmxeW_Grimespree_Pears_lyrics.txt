A source of knowledge
The well of pain
The wilted ruins of
A muse that wouldn't take

Poorly crafting spans of time
Unrepentant in devotion to a life of grime
Fragile protection
From the fear of faith forgot
I am nil in the war for attention
Hidden and meek, a subversive plot

Is this autonomy?
Sorted, spread out, fuse lit, kaboom
With detailed destruction, new American room
Unwilling participant, I will not abide
But someone must let me out
I'm pleading, bargaining to little avail
The glances away just like knives in the back

A source of knowledge
The well of pain
The wilted ruins of
A muse that wouldn't take
You might also like
Cycle shatters, exquisite alone
A spatial disorder, never close, still too near
The knocking is incessant
Index randomized, such a crowded abyss
The updates repair me to broken default

The source of knowledge
The well of pain
The wilted ruins of
A muse that wouldn't take


A passing resemblance
To new frontiers that consume me
I am still at my core a defendant
Forbidden is defeat, feel my jealousy

I want to lie down!
I want to lie down!
I want to lie down!
I want to lie down!
All? No, all!Embed
