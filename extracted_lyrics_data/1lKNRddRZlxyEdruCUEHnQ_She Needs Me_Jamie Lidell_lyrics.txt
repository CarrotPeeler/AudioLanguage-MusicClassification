Just make it sweeter that she needs you
She needs you in the mornin'
Just to cook her some eggs sometimes
And she needs you in the afternoon
Just to give her little bit of that sweet afternoon love
And she needs you in the evening
Just to get a little more
Oh, don't ever let her go
Don’t ever let her go
Don’t ever let this one go
She’s the sweetest thing you’ll ever know
Each time we look into each other’s eyes
With all the trouble that we've seen
Maybe in some way we never thought we'd make it so far
Look at where we've been
I was hopin' she would let me in
For more than a cup of tea
I wanted so much from the moment I met you
And now i'm thanking the lord
You’re still the sweetest thing I've ever known
And every day I wake up in the morning with you on my pillow
I just count my blessings, I say, “Oh!”

She wants me, she wants me in her life
She wants me, she needs me – and I must confess
I need her tooEmbed
