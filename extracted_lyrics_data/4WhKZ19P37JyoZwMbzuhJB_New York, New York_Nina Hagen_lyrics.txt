7 ContributorsNew York, New York Lyrics
New York City is the hottest place
For a honeymoon in a hotel room
New York City is my favorite place
'Cause I know so many people with a golden face (uh huh)
It's always late at night when I wanna go out
And New York City has for sure the horniest crowd
Especially for me and this is true
I have the best time when you're there too, honey

After the show, when we are ready to go
We are going disco
But before we hit East 7th Street
We are going to another disco
Disco after disco
And shaking our hair to the disco rap
AM/PM, Pyramid, Roxy, Mudd Club, Danceteria
The newest club is opening up
The newest club is opening up
The newest club is opening up

New York, New York
New York, New York
New York, New York
New York, New York
New York!
You might also like
New York City is the hottest place
For a honeymoon in a hotel room (uh huh)
New York City is a place so nice
Everybody says it so they had to name it twice
New York my happy love's you
(I love you very much)
I could not live without you
So let's always keep in touch
New York City has the fanciest rule
When you want to live in this town you just have to be a fool

After the show when we are ready to go
We are going disco
But before we hit East 7th Street
We are going to another disco
Disco after disco
And shaking our hair to the disco rap
AM/PM, Pyramid, Roxy, Mudd Club, Danceteria
The newest club is opening up
The newest club is opening up
The newest club is opening up

New York, New York
New York, New York
New York, New York
New York, New York
New York, New York
New York, New York
New York, New York
New York, New York
New York!
It's going hop hop hop hop hop hop
Straight up to the top
Hop hop hop hop hop hop
Straight up to the top
Let there be light
'Cause David Bowie's gonna be here tonight in New York
I create ecstacy in my world
I know who I am
And I am willing to declare myself to the world
I am a star!
In New York
Whosoever with meEmbed
