1 ContributorEnemies / Friends LyricsLately in the hospitals
The half-way homes and choking jails
There's people on the mend again, with hope to carry on again
It makes me feel that something's right for
Everyone who tries to fight;
No politics or dirty tricks
More standing up and shouting out
All the money in the world won't save you
We're coming home
All the prisons that you build won't hold us
Just let us go
Then I found a broken heart
That dusty, wheezing thing won't start
I'll fix it up, and watch it grow
And send it to a happy home
It don't take much to raise a smile
To push yourself the extra mile
I'll stay with you when things go wrong
And lie and say its not too long
All the money in the world won't save you
We're coming home
All the prisons that you build won't hold us
Just let us go

Your enemies won't matter in the endEmbed
