2 ContributorsLady Liberty Lyrics
Get it on
Let it out
There's no room for angry people
Trying hard to get along
There's nothing if not heroes
Taking roll and folding cards

'Cause only Lady Liberty could say it all
Well, I bet she would
She'd lift it off
Send it up
Letting them know they're average people
Trying hard to play along
There's hope for us redeemers
And there's still this song
If only Lady Liberty could see us now
Well I bet she would go
"I know you're angry, dangling down
I know what you've been singing
Don't need no raggy-tagging
'I love you's from anybody"

Get it on
Let it out
There's no room for scary people
Trying hard to party on
There's nothing but hypocrisy
And carrying on
And making moves and shaking stars
And solar cars
Man, that bitch is good
You might also like
She's making it up, shaking it off
Let â€˜em know they're scary people
Trying hard to find a cause
There's hope for us redeemers
It's distilled in song
If only Lady Liberty could play a part
Well, I bet she would go
"I know you're angry, dangling
But I know what you've been thinking
Don't need no raggy-tagging
'I love you's from anybody
I know you're angry, dangling down
I know what you've been bringing
Don't need no candy-coated
'I owe you's from anybody"

Get it off
Let it out
There's no room for angry people
Trying hard to get along
There's nothing if not heroes
Taking roll and folding cards
If only Lady Liberty could see us now
Well, I bet she does
Bet she wouldEmbed
