3 ContributorsCarry Your Load Lyrics
I said I take what I want
And I got my eye on you
It's late in the evening
What are you gonna do

I got the place
If you got the time
I got the motion, baby
If you got the mind

So wise man tell me
What it means to give and take
It's double trouble
But it can ease a little heartache

So you can carry your load
Down the long, winding road
Carry your load
Down the long, winding road

All I'm asking
All I wanna do is just
Put a little love in your heart
Put a little love in your heart
You might also like
I said I know what I want
And it's close to the bone
Sooner or later, baby
I'll be taking you home

You got the cool
But you give me the heat
You got the music, baby
But you give me the beat, ow

Wise man tell me
What it means to give and take
It's double trouble
But it can ease a little heartache

So you can carry your load
Down the long, winding road
Carry your load
Down the long, winding road

All I'm asking
All I wanna do is just
Put a little love in your heart
Yeah yeah
Wise man tell me
What it means to give and take
It's double trouble
But it can ease a little heartache

So you can carry your load
Down the long, winding road
Carry your load
Down the long, winding road

You got to carry your load
Down the long, winding road
Carry your load
Down the long, winding road

Carry your load
(Down the long, winding road)
You got to carry your load
(Down the long, winding road)

You got to carry your load
Down the long, winding road
Yeah yeah (Carry your load)
(Down the long, winding road)Embed
