Wanna fly high the older I get
It all keeps slipping away, I'm carrying an increasingly high-weight load
Seems like it might just work out, but then it’s a dead end
I must be in a maze, I'm stuck
Inside my head, there's a traffic, red light
Fatigue is piling up, the maze has turned pitch-black
Brake pedal, step on it, beep, beep, beep
If I don't stop now, I'll crash and just get mad, huff and puff
Pedal to the metal, but again, streak, streak
My words are crossed out with a line scratch, scratch
I ain't tryna fight, let me go
Running barefoot, getting scrapes and scratches on my toes
A runway under the sky that looks like it might fall
As the days go by, my shoulders drop lower to the ground

The time is tickin', moving faster
Time goes by quickly
The moonlight shines past midnight until the next day
Everything is slipping through my fingers
Cynical, things are getting on my nerves
What a day, I’m like a criminal
Nobody seeks me

Let's count one, two, three, four, five
Time is ticking, and the numbers are changing
Only the small LED light flickers
Feels like whoo whoo whoo
Next comes six, seven, eight, and nine o'clock
The sun is flashing in the sky so bright
The days are getting longer
Feels like whoo whoo whoo

Oh, everybody dancing on the stage, not me
On a deserted island, I watch the party
Call yeah, 9-1-1, I can't even breathe
Oh, everybody dancing on the stage, not me
On a deserted island, I watch the party
Call yeah, 9-1-1, I can't even breathe

Who said, who said, I'll be okay, be okay
Don't say, don't say, I know it's all a lie, oh, please
No lie thought my life would be full of starlight
For now, no more dreams, everything gets shut down
Every day is full of flurry, every single day makes me go crazy, oh, yeah
Falling on the old faded sketchbook, the drops of rain, yeah
Teach me how to get my smile back
There aren't any clues, somebody help
I just can't wake up, so tired of this nightmare

The time is tickin', moving faster
Time goes by quickly
The moonlight shines past midnight until the next day
Everything is slipping through my fingers
Cynical, things are getting on my nerves
What a day, I’m like a criminal
Nobody seeks me
Let's count one, two, three, four, five
Time is ticking, and the numbers are changing
Only the small LED light flickers
Feels like whoo whoo whoo
Next comes six, seven, eight, and nine o'clock
The sun is flashing in the sky so bright
The days are getting longer
Feels like whoo whoo whoo

Oh, everybody dancing on the stage, not me
On a deserted island, I watch the party
Call yeah, 9-1-1, I can't even breathe
Oh, everybody dancing on the stage, not me
On a deserted island, I watch the party
Call yeah, 9-1-1, I can't even breatheEmbed
