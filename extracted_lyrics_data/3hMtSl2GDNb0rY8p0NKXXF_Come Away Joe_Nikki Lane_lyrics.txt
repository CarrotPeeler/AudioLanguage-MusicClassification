Come away like you don't know now
Come away joe
Get over here now boy
I say it now
Come away with me
Were goin on a ride
To the darkest side
And you don't have to be
Aware of these
Kind of things
Come away joe
Come away run away is that you know to be true
Yes you do
Come away joe
We got other things to do
Here on the darker side
Yes we do
And you will say
Where are we happy in this
Simply the way we would have been
Oh oh oh oh
Come away joe
Oh oh oh oh
Come away joe
Your the saddest man i know
Oh oh oh oh
Come away joe
Oh oh oh oh
Come away joe
Your the saddest man i knowYou might also likeEmbed
