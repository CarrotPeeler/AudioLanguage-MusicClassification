The next plane I hope to take
If the bird gets ready for me
I will catch just in time
I see Lisa scratcing me back
And the children playing around
When the dogs bark in the back yard
I feel I'm home ones again
Fly, fly away, fly away my flamingo
Fly to my home, across the see
Fly, fly away, fly away my flamingo
Fly away, fly away, fly away, bring the message to me
Creole ladies flatten their hair
It's time for the jamboree
It's better when this boys starts jammin'
I'll survive in this place
With the money, I will make
The next plane I hope to take
If the bird gets ready for me
I will catch just in time

Fly to my home, across the see
Fly, fly away, fly away my flamingo
Fly away, fly away, fly away, bring the message to meEmbed
