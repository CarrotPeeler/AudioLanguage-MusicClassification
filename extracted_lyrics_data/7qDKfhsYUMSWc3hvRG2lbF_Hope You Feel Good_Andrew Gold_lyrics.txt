Good as you make me feel
Hope you feel good
Loving you is such a thrill
Ev'ry time I look into your eyes
Or hear you call my name I realize
I feel so good
As I always thought I would
And I'll do everything I should
To make you feel good
Spending all my time
Making up my mind
How I'm gonna tell you
Darling what you mean to me
It's gonna take some real fine poetry
If I only could then I surely would
Get myself to write you a symphony
With the most beautiful melody
That you have ever heard
Hope you feel good
Good as you make me feel
Hope you feel good
Loving you is such a thrill
Ev'ry time I look into your eyes
Or hear you call my name I realize
You might also likeI feel so good
As I always thought I would
And I'll do everything I should
To make you feel good
Spring is in the air
Blossoms everywhere
The sun is shining brightly
Makes you feel good inside
When you know that love is so bona fide
On a summer night when the stars are bright
We'll make a date and then we'll go strolling soon
And take a look at this romantic moon
You hear so much about
Hope you feel good
Good as you make me feel
Hope you feel good
Loving you is such a thrill
Ev'ry time I look into your eyes
Or hear you call my name I realize
I feel so good
Just like I always wished I would
And I'll do everything I should
To make you feel real good
Hope you feel good ya
Good as you make me feel
Hope you feel good
Loving you is such a thrill
Ev'ry time I look into your eyes
Or hear you call my name I realize
I feel so good
Just like I always wished I would
And I'll do everything I should
To make you feel real good
Yes I'll do everything I could
To make you feel real good
Yes I'll do everything I should
To make you feel real good
Yes I'll do everything I should
To make you feel real goodEmbed
