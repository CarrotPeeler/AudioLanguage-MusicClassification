Too many problems the world can't solve
Too many people, no one wants to be involved
(Lack of communication, back off)
Keep rearrangin', it's all the same
Always sayin' someone else is to blame
(Lack of communication, back off)

Look all around me, who's standin' tall?
Hold tight, no one's gonna answer your call
(Lack of communication, back off)
Put up our boundaries, webuild our walls
It's alright, no one's gonna change us at all
(Lack of communication, back off)

Time's passin' us by
We have our reason
No one wants to try
We have our reason
Questions askin' why
We have our reason
Problems still arise
We have our reason for
Back off

You're so together, you fall apart
You never miss when you're shootin' straight for the heart
(Lack of communication, back off)
You see it your way, I'll see it mine
Well, conversation is a useless change of line
(Lack of communication, back off)

Time's passin' us by
We have our reason
No one wants to try
We have our reason
Questions askin' why
We have our reason
Problems still arise
We have our reason for

Well, back off, weâ€™ll, back off

In the age of the modern man

We see the problems, but we don't really understand
(Lack of communication, back off)
Well, lack of communication

Well, lack of communication
