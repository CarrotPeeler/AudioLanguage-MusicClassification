2 ContributorsFor Earth Below LyricsTrower
It is the face that is the mirror
It is the eyes to look within
And the door remains open
A passing dream calls you in, calls you in
It is the mind that knows no distance
And yet how far no one can say
While the hand is helplessly waiting
With each breath a life begins, a life begins
Oo, don't they see it's just like sleeping
Please don't wonder oh, how they know
While you dream a child is weeping
And each tear's a soul, for earth below, for earth below
For earth below
For earth below
For earth below
For earth below
