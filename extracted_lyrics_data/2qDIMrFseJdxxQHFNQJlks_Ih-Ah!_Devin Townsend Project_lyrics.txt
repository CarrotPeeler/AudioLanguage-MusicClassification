14 ContributorsIh-Ah! LyricsAs everything in life, comes together now
I need your mind
And everything is light, I remember now
I see you rise
And all the lonely things, seem to want to change
I'll sleep on it tonight

Ah...
Ih-ah...(x8)
We don't even understand
Something's going on
We don't even understand
So how could this be wrong

Ah..
Ih-ah...(x7)
I'm so in love with you
How could I
Ever be untrue?
Am I with you?
With everything I do
God I love you
I love you...

Something's going on
We don't even understand
So how could we be wrong

Ah...
Ih-ah...(x15)
We don't know or care
Something's always there
We see it's in our own hands
But we just don't understandEmbed
