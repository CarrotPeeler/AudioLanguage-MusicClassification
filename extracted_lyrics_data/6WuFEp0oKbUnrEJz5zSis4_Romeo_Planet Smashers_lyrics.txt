1 ContributorRomeo LyricsMy girlfriend is a lesbian
Not even bi-sexual
Am I just a thespian
Acting out Romeo?
We cruise chicks together
We dress in real fake leather
But sometimes the weather
It gets to hot...
We can kiss like mothers
We can sleep like brothers
We can walk like lovers
But thats as far as it goes
And so I do not hesitate
To hope one day that she turns straight
And if that day never comes
Then make me a lesbianYou might also likeEmbed
