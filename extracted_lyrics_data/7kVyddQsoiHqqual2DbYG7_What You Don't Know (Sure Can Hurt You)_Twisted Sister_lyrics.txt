3 ContributorsWhat You Donâ€™t Know (Sure Can Hurt You) LyricsGood evening! Ha ha ha, welcome to our show
If you've got that problem, yeah, well, I think that you should know
This ain't the same old story or the same old song and dance
Don't speak of faded glory 'cause you won't get a second chance
I want to tell you something, I'm someone you can trust
You'd better take a good hard look 'cause we're the diamond in this dust
Hit it! We're no overnight sensation, no Cinderella fantasy
Please no plaudits or ovations, I've heard it all before you see
CHORUS:
What you don't know sure can hurt you
What you can't see makes you scream
What you don't know sure can hurt you
What you don't have is what you dream
Ain't we a pretty picture, ain't we a load of fun?
Don't let me influence you, I'll do that when we're done
Oh, are we irritating, oh, are we grating on your nerves?
Don't you know that the good boys never get what they deserve
REPEAT CHORUS
Your brain is filled with questions, you don't know how or why
Don't look to me for answers, honey, 'cause I don't want to lie

How do you like it so far, say ain't we quite a show?
There's no one else quite like us, the others all get up and go
Don't fill my head with stories, you see I ain't no debutante
Let's get to the nitty gritty, now you give me what I want
REPEAT CHORUS
What you dreamEmbed
