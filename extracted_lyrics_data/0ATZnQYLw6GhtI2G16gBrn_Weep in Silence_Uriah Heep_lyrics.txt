2 ContributorsWeep in Silence LyricsYou who thought
Your eyes could tell no lies
So your life became a compromise
And it was you
Who had seen men dyin'
You heard their children cryin'
While their women weep in silence
And you who thought
You were so wise
Succeeded only in disguise
Now and then
You'd find a bridge to cross
Reach the other side
And you'd still be lost
Evaded by the sweet smell of life
And the people that you try
To show the way
Never believe you
Never believe you - no way
While your women weep in silence
Your women weep in silence
Women weep in silenceSee Uriah Heep LiveGet tickets as low as $94You might also likeEmbed
