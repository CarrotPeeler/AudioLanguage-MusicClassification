1 ContributorBack Room LyricsI know you
Do not want to
End up
Inside my backroom
I swear to God
They'll find you
Shot up
Inside my backroom
I don’t really think
That I feel right
You ever sat one night
Like tonight's
The night
These mothaf*****
Gonna bust in the door
Gripping a steel pipe
Headshot
Man Down
Going on a killstrike
Then you end up on the floor
Trippin and bloody
These mothaf*****
Don't want somebody
Saying to somebody
Any kind of reason
They just wanna shoot up your cutty
Well God forgive me if I do
What I gotta do
Just trust me
You fuck with the wrong motherf*****
You’ll end up so shriveled and tuckered
Like bucker to bammer
And cocking the hammer
I'm aiming my gun
And I'm huntin for supper
Somеbody better be holding mе back I swear
Not gonna be giving a f***
If your tryna touch my heir
I'm gonna be busting like a rapper
Who just copped a beat
I put the chicken in the oven
When I cock the heat
Bitch
Stick em up
Like they're concert fliers
Draw their blood
Like I'm a healthcare provider
Fire five bullets if I find em
Crawling in my house like a black widow spider
The mission be disintegrating
Anybody integrating
Tryna be habilitating
Into my oasis
You will be precipitating
When the gun be killa spraying
Smell the blood ventilating
Now who is courageous
Brotha
I don't think I wanna do this
Blow your whole body back
And leave you shoeless
At this point
I think that we're both acting foolish
Busting at my door
You’d think
You would knew this
You dumb bitch
You might also likeI know you
Do not want to
End up
Inside my backroom
I swear to God
They’ll find you
Shot up
Inside my backroom
You don't really wanna be the one
To end up inside of my back room
Like a Saw trap
I find a victim of preference
And catch them walking alone
Then I’m beating their cranium
With a ball bat
Then I throw em in the trunk
With a ball gag
And roll them up
Like burritos inside of tarp wrap
Taking them down into the woods
To my cabin in the back
Next to where all the bodies
I'll discard at
I got an all black mask on
In a pandemic
So to others
I am inconspicuous
I got a pistol in the whip
And other instruments
With current occurrences
My intentions seem ambiguous
As I pull up to the side of the curb
And grab you
You might as well ride in a hearse
Cause when I re-emerge
With a knife and the urge
To slice and dice
You ain't gonna find you the words
To remain calm
Or get up out of this mess
I popped the latch on the trunk
And then dragged you out on your head
Everybody in this cabin
That I've had in here before
You all have one thing in common
That’s that all of them dead
You ain't dumb
Look around
You'll see the bones and remains
It's hopeless to pray
You're gonna join them today
You're going to decay
With your brain matter
And blood splattered
All over walls
As your soul goes away
I
Love the feeling of power that I have over them
You're dead now
But I promise there'll be more of them
Shower in your blood
I could fill it in the tub
I don't really give a f***
This addiction is a morbid love
I'm in love
As I pull up on another unsuspecting victim
Clutching on a loaded gun
I'm gonna kill them
That's when I know the fun is beginning for me
I beat them up and torture them
I know you
Do not want to
End up
Inside my backroom
I swear to God
They'll find you
Shot up
Inside my backroom
Run into this house
You gon end up on the ground
In the back room
Blood cells
Leaking from your mouth
Heaters pulling out
Till they no longer make a sound
And that click click
The last thing
You hear before you out
Ain't no homies round here
Drop your body by myself
Think I wasn't bout s***
Now you dying by yourself
Shotgun shells
Hit the ground
Full of smoke
And right after bang bang
I hear the homie f****** choke
Feeling hella loke
I was waiting for ya bitch boy
Busting through the door
Then I hit you with that destroy
Tie you up with rope
After 18 f***** deploy
No face
No trace
Ain't no need for decoys
Get locked up
And I ain't talking jail cell
So in the end
Ain't no way for you to get a bail
Tall tails
Till ya witness what I pack dawg
So trust me you dont you dont really want it dawg
Swear to god
They won't find you
In the back room
Get ripped apart by the dogs
I have attack you
Throw out the rest
Then I rest
Till the feds
Come and question
Why I ain't got no f****** stress upon my chest
You can bet
You ain't ready for your end time
Drop my Hancock
On the cause of death line
Record the sound
Of your motherf****** b**** crying
All because you wanna come
To try and take mine
Well that ain't finna happen
Most you motherfuckas
Think I'm only rapping
Til it pop off
And ya see me get to clapping
And your drug off back
To where the a** is smacking
Ya dumb bitch
Know I'm always pistol packing
Hollows ripping through you
Like an open package
What my ass got
Only gonna cause ya damage
That's why I'll telling you mothafucka
I know you
Do not want to
End up
Inside my backroom
I swear to God
They'll find you
Shot up
Inside my backroomEmbed
