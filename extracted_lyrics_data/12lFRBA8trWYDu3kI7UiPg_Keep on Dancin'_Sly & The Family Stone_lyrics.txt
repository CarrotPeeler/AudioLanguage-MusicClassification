Dance to the music
Dance to the music
Dance to the music
Keep on dancin' to the music
Keep on dancin' to the music
If them Joneses, hey, let us alone
Then them Stones I bet, oh oh oh, get it on
And that's why, girl, me and you, woo woo woo
Get along, girl, easy, too, oh oh
Keep on dancin' to the music
Keep on dancin' to the music
Keep on dancin' for the thang
Keep on dancin' don't you hear-I say
Dance to the music
Dance to the music
Dance to the music
Dance to the music
Take the floor then, huh, you lookin' good
I'd get snowed in if I could
You're the one, girl, and you know
Number one, girl, that's for sure
You might also likeKeep on dancin' for the thing
Keep on dancin', hear me sing
Dance to the music
Dance to the music
Dance to the music
Dance to the musicEmbed
