4 ContributorsEllie My Love Lyrics
There were times I left your heart in pain
Time again I turned and walked away
I get to where I'm going just to find
Won't be happy in this world
If you're not by my side
Ellie, my love, so sweet

My heart told me to break away
Now I'm out here far away
Wishing that I could hold you in the night, baby
Then I'd wake up to a morning that is warm and bright
Whoa, Ellie, my love, so sweet

Smile for me, won't you, baby
Forever you'll be on my mind
Drink with me won't you, baby
We're gonna make it right this time
There's no one else like you
Anything you want, I'll do
Ellie, my love so sweet
Well, Ellie (Ellie), my love, so sweet

My heart told me to break away
Now I'm here so far away
Wishing that I could hold you in the night, baby (So tight)
Then I'd wake up to a morning that is warm and bright
Ellie, my love, so sweet
You might also like
Smile for me, won't you, baby
Forever you'll be on my mind
Drink with me won't you, baby
We're gonna make it right this time
There's no one else like you
Anything you want, I'll do
Ellie, my love, so sweet
Yes, Ellie (Ellie), my love so sweet

(Smile for me, won't you, baby) Smile for me, baby
(Forever you'll be on my mind)
Forever you'll be on my mind
(Drink with me won't you, baby)
Drink for me, baby
(We're gonna make it right this time)
Yes, this time
There's no one else like you
Anything you want, I'll do
Ellie, my love, so sweet
Whoa-ho, Ellie (Ellie), my love, so sweet
Yes, Ellie, my love, oh, so sweet, yes
Come here, womanEmbed
