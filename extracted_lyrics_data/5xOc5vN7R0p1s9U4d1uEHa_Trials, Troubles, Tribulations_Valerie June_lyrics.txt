4 ContributorsTrials, Troubles, Tribulations Lyrics
Trials, troubles, tribulations
Such has never been before
When the angels pour upon us
Their vows of wrath forevermore

When the fire comes down from heaven
And the blood shall fill the sea
I'll be carried home by Jesus
And forever with him be

The beast with horns will come upon you
One with seven, one with ten
Men will cry unto the mountains
They'll pray to die but cannot win

When the fire comes down from heaven
And the blood shall fill the sea
I'll be carried home by Jesus
And forever with him be

The mark must be upon your forehead
These worldly goods you can then buy
"Depart from me, I never knew you"
You'll hear our blessed Savior cry
You might also like
When the fire comes down from heaven
And the blood shall fill the sea
I'll be carried home by Jesus
And forever with him be

I'll be carried home by Jesus
And forever with him beEmbed
