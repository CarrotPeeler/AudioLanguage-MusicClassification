2 ContributorsThird Time Lucky LyricsFirst one it's a shock
A second helping not good enough
Third time lucky and you've arrived!
If you have any doubts then try once more...
Maybe i was too impressed...
He flattered i was blushing
He found my joie de vivre so cute and rather touching
Himself so upwardly mobile, so cerebral, clever
Could i ever live up to his dreams
Or would i like to play a part in his scheme?
I don't think so...
I have my plans and brave ambition
Knowing no bounds, no inhibitions
'nd i'm aware there's a lesson in every fall
So next time i'll get closer
First one it's a shock
A second helping not good enough
Third time lucky and you've arrived!
If you have any doubts then try one more time
Later i met a boy whose inner life was his true passion
We did connect in an exploratory fashion
He claimed what tie us to this mortal coil we should sever
Could i ever live up to his dreams
Or would i like to play a part in his scheme?
Oh i fear not...
You might also likeI have my plans and brave ambition
Knowing no bounds, no inhibitions
'nd i'm aware there's a lesson in every fall
So next time i might get it rightEmbed
