And it makes me sad, to be surrounded
There's not much else that I can do to change
But in my dreams I see you dying
The world keeps going round
With the sun and the moon
And you and I are somehow inbetween
We are hopelessly waiting
For the sky to fall down
I put my hands up
Don't look around
Sometimes we can forget just who we are
Sometimes it's hard, to look around you
We seem to move, but never very far
And I don't know why we care about it
But the world keeps going round
With the sun and the moon
And you and I are somehow inbetween
We are hopelessly waiting
For the sky to fall down
I put my hands up
Don't look aroundYou might also likeEmbed
