13 ContributorsYou Wonâ€™t Be Missing That Part of Me Lyrics
Because I lied with all my heart
Because it's time to change my life

'Cause you won't be missing that part of me
It's all you need when telling everyone that you're free
Hold on, you'll see, it won't be that hard to forget me
I hope you won't

I ruined your endearing soul
Wish you knew I was too young

Because you cried, doesn't mean you can talk to me
When you decide

At least you won't be missing that part of me
It's all you need when telling everyone that you're free
Hold on, you'll see, it won't be that hard to forget me
I hope you won't

Will you forgive that I left?
Should've predicted why you would hateYou might also likeEmbed
