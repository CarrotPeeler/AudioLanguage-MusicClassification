Can’t help feeling that's the way it ought to be
You know we could run away but I couldn't bear
To hear the things they’d say, oh no
Baby let's pretend that tonight we'll live forever
If we close our eyes and believe it might come true
Baby let's pretend we could always be together
But for now just let me spend the night with you
Somehow, someday things are gonna be so different
Don't cry, some way, I promise it'll be all right
So now that we're all alone
I couldn't bear to leave or take you home, oh no
Baby let’s pretend that tonight we’ll live forever
If we close our eyes and believe it might come true
Baby let's pretend we could always be together
But for now just let me spend the night with you
So take me now, my love can’t wait
We're almost there now darling, darling
Hold me, hold me, hold meYou might also likeEmbed
