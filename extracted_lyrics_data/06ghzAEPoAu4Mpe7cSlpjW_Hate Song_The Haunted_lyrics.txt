A meat cleaver comb to run you through
Lethal gas will make you cough
A car crash scene to finish it off
Pain!
True definition
Truth is pain
Truly addicted
So don't you worry about your earthly rest
I'll dig the fucking hole myself
Pain!
Truly addicted
Life is pain
I am addicted
To this pain
Hate song!...(I live to bury you)...
Stabbing and shooting and ripping the life out of you
I get off and I wish that you could too!
Open chest tickle will quiver your bones
Just lay back and chill. 'cos I run this show
You might also likePain!
Truly addicted
Life is pain
Life is infected
By this pain......
Hate song!...(I live to bury you)...
There's no need to explain
You know who you are
I deliver the pain
I'm the baddest by far...
Die onehundredthousand times
One million ways to...Hate! Hate! Hate! Hate! Hate! Hate! Hate! Hate! Hate!
Hate song!
Lifelong!
Hate song!Embed
