Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
For you, I’ll go a thousand miles
At a state of vulnerability, I can’t explain
Even only breathing, I am touched this is strange
I can’t contain myself, overwhelmed & moved
I translate your paint & works in other words
Infinity
Infinity
Infinity
A pattern in the breeze, uncovering debris
I travel onto other plains in search
For you, for you
For you, for you
Infinity
Infinity

I believe (Infinity)
You got me scaling walls & blockades (Infinity)
I’m amazed by your majesty, your majesty
Beyond the mundane (Infinity)

Sounds of a melody
