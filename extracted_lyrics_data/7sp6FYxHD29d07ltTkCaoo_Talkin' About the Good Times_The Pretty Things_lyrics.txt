3 ContributorsTalkinâ€™ About The Good Times LyricsTalkin' about the good times, talkin' about the good...
Talkin' about the good times, talkin' about the good...
She has sun in her face
Her lips kiss the sun
Caress the sun
Fields of light we found the place
She had sun in her eyes
The clouds crossed the sun
Without the sun
There's evening shadows in her eyes
Talkin' about the good times, talkin' about the good...
Talkin' about the good times, talkin' about the good...
She had braided her hair
The grass jumped through the rain
Reach to the rain
Tears of mystic rain in the air
She had tears in her eyes
The skies turned to gray
Melt away
Shining streaks in rain that day
