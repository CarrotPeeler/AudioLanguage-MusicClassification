2 ContributorsWhen I Feel You LyricsI can´t believe, that I found you here
Will my hopeless surch end with you
I am the end to all your fears
I´m so afraid of losing you again
But I will never let you down again
And I, I can never let you go again
When I feel you, I know that I am the one for you
When I need you, I know that you are the one I´ve been surching so long
I will never let you go again
And I know you can´t live without me anymore
I know without me you will die
But you´re so pretty when you cryYou might also likeEmbed
