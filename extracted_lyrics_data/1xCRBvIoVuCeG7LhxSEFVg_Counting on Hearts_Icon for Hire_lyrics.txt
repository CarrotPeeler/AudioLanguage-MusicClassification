I'm counting on hearts like yours to keep me burning
To keep me up 'til two in the morning
You be bright when I'm starting to rust
You be why behind the what
I'm counting on hearts like yours to help remind me
Keep ignoring the white noise behind me
Don't ever let them water me down
I'm counting, I'm counting on you now

Oh I remember that feeling, I must be dreaming

Am I just wasting our time?
Feel like I'm feeding you lines
Nothing left to say
Losing fire and growing tired, uninspired
But I will never let go
Never let up my hold
Cause I know
Once you feel it you can't unfeel it
Once you dream it you can't undream it

I'm counting on hearts like yours to keep me crazy
To rough me up 'til nothing can phase me
Will you tell me when it isn't enough?
And never let me live halfway
I'm counting on hearts like yours to get me through it
I'm a fighter now let me prove it
Don't ever let me water it down
I'm counting, I'm counting on you now
You might also like
Oh I remember that feeling, I must be dreaming

Am I just wasting our time?
Feel like I'm feeding you lines
Nothing left to say
Losing fire and growing tired, uninspired
But I will never let go
Never let up my hold
Cause I know
Once you feel it you can't unfeel it
Once you dream it you can't undream it

Some things are not as they seem
Holding on tight to yesterday's dream
Some things are worth fighting for
All we need are hearts like yours
Some things are not as they seem
Holding on tight to yesterday's dream
Some things are worth fighting for
All we need are hearts like yours

Am I just wasting our time?
Feel like I'm feeding you lines
Nothing left to say
Losing fire and growing tired, uninspired
But I will never let go
Never let up my hold
Cause I know
Once you feel it you can't unfeel it
Once you dream it you can't undream it
Am I just wasting our time?
Feel like I'm feeding you lines
Nothing left to say
Losing fire and growing tired, uninspired
But I will never let go
Never let up my hold
Cause I know
Once you feel it you can't unfeel it
Once you dream it you can't undream it9Embed
