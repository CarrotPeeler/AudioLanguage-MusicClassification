35 ContributorsPennywise Lyrics
Yeah, they used to laugh at me but who the fuck is laughing now?
From the trenches, I've returned again to drag you through the ground
Fear me, fear me, hear me whisper in the night
Too late, too late, bitch, I got you in my sight

So apocalyptic, my flow sadistic
Wanna stop, dark thoughts been so addicted
Hearing voices telling me to kill them all
Came right back, now I'm ready to brawl
Watching them run when I'm hitting the scene
Bringing it, better believe
What you gonna do when the dark thoughts follow you?
Better off dead, now we all float too
Like yuh, hundred-five visions of death
Scared of what might happens next
Talk up the side of your neck
Might have to pump you with lead
Bitch, I'm possessed
Want it so much, gonna think I signed to Satan
Handed over my soul, my ship is vacant
So my fans are the coal, like a bunch of pagans
Gonna bring in the days when he awakens, yuh

Watch 'em running for their life now
We've been making tracks like every day, it's sounding nice now
Yeah, we're 'bout to take over the game, we're plotting right now
Sick of all these idiots, about to change their minds now, yuh
You might also like
Yeah, they used to laugh at me but who the fuck is laughing now?
From the trenches, I've returned again to drag you through the ground
Fear me, fear me, hear me whisper in the night
Too late, too late, bitch, I got you in my sight

They say we all float in the dark place
Where we all go
Walls closed with my jaw sewed
I'm a lost soul
Seal me up and throw me under
Drown under the rolling thunder
Rain floods in the drain, it's just like blood through my veins, drip off my fingertips
Rip the stitches off my lips
So I can breathe again
I fill my lungs with cold air
Hits my tongue, a cold stare
With a grin
Evil has risen again, demons with angelic presence
Serpents break the surface

Watch 'em running for their life now
We've been making tracks like every day, it's sounding nice now
Yeah, we're 'bout to take over the game we're plotting right now
Sick of all these idiots about to change their minds now, yuh
Yeah, they used to laugh at me but who the fuck is laughing now?
From the trenches, I've returned again to drag you through the ground
Fear me, fear me, hear me whisper in the night
Too late, too late, bitch, I got you in my sight
Yeah, they used to laugh at me but who the fuck is laughing now?
From the trenches, I've returned again to drag you through the ground
Fear me, fear me, hear me whisper in the night
Too late, too late, bitch, I got you in my sight

Watch 'em running for their life now
We've been making tracks like every day, it's sounding nice now
Yeah, we're 'bout to take over the game we're plotting right now
Sick of all these idiots about to change their minds now, yuh, yuh6Embed
