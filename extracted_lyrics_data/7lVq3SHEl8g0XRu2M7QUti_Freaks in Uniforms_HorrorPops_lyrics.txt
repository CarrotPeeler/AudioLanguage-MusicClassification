2 ContributorsFreaks In Uniforms LyricsMusical correctness
It's just a guide on how to perform
Everything less
Stuffed up opinions
Dooms all thinking
Trying to put everything in a box
Freaks in uniform
Creating norms
It's misguided unity!
In it for the thrill
It's got it's own will
You can go "Na-Na-Na-Na" yourself
Can't keep it clean
It's a live pinball machine
You can go "Na-Na-Na-Na" yourself
A dangerous decease
But I don't wanna be cured
I don't want to just be pure
It's low self esteem
Creates inbreeds
A zombified closed community
A brainwashed breed of hypocrisy
It's misguided loyalty!

To know where i belong
Freak out!Embed
