How sweet that joyous sound
Whenever we meet, whenever we meet
How sweet that joyous sound
Whenever we meet again

I think you know it will
Whenever we meet, whenever we meet
I think you know it will
Whenever we meet again

Just let it in and let it out (Yeah)
Then you will begin to know without a doubt

That grace will follow us
Wherever we go, wherever we go
That grace will follow us
Until we meet again (Hey)


Just let it in and let it out (Alright now)
Then you will begin to know without a doubt
You might also like
That grace will follow us
Wherever we go, wherever we go
That grace will follow us
Until we meet again

How sweet that joyous sound
Whenever we meet, whenever we meet
How sweet that joyous sound
Whenever we meet again

Oh, whenever we meet, whenever we meet
Whenever we meet again
Oh, whenever we meet, whenever we meet
Whenever we meet again
Oh, whenever we meet, whenever we meet
Whenever we meet again
