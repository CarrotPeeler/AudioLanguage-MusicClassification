1 ContributorSingle Moment LyricsThe sun goes down around me here
And somewhere else it's rising once again
The air that fills my lungs to full can
Somehow cause a breeze to pull a ship to land
There is not a single moment
That You don't see
There is not a single moment
That You're not here with me
And every thought I've had today, well
You knew what they'd be before they were
And every heart that beats in time with
What You want is sure to find Your voice is heard
There is not a single moment
That You don't see
There is not a single moment
That You're not here with me
Though I try to do my best
So often, often now I must confess to wrong
As sure as this ol' air I breathe
You made a plan for my reprieve to lead me on
There is not a single moment
That You don't see
There is not a single moment
That You're not here with meYou might also likeEmbed
