1 ContributorThousand Year Old Child LyricsSealing again
But I can’t see
What I can steal
And I’m looking at the window
There is no reason
To take about time
But this time I feel
I feel like a puzzle
You’ll be here no more
It’s just a question
Ooh I can see you walking at the door
You sleep at night
There is a question
What am I doing in my life
What did I do
You’ll be here no more
I can see you walking out the door
Oooh
UuuhYou might also likeEmbed
