1 ContributorMultiply And Divide Lyrics
Your attention please
You are now in the Central-Standard Time Zone
Please adjust your watches accordingly
Thank you
Put the keys to the car
Then they'll know that someone sits inside
Put a flag on the back
Then they'll see you've got American pride
Keep your eyes on the ground
Chemicals gonna keep you from those lies
Now you're part of the plan that they've got
Get your peas in a pod and you'll
Multiply then divide
Go!
Will someone in the spark scene
Take these girls, run them in the right way  (Go!)
Everybody says that the girls control this town
Do you really want to find out? (Go!)
Fuel to the fire I fear sometime
On the pills and these hearts expire (Go!)
I take a shortcut So I panda extreme 
D-I-V-I-D-E

Get your head around me
You've got to think about it (No!)
Look!
At what's going on around you
Learn!
How to think things through
And things that you can do to
Fight!
They'll divide then multiply
Put the keys to the house
At the end of the circle then you'll see
That just talk to the plan
But you know it makes everybody free
Get up back to the wall to control
Who you'll talk to, who you'll see
You'll be American dream
How's it feel have you got what you want
And you'll multiply and divide (Go!)
Straight to the point
And you're lending your voice
Pretending you're standing up
For what's right (Go!)
Division on the A.M. multiply
F.M. give it to the best one yet (Go!)
And never what you want
And never what you get
And straight to the point to the best one (Go!)
(I'm taking chopped nuts and remember that's
Too much pee?)
I D-I-V-I-D-E
Well now that's not exact but the point
Is that robbers know the thieves
Keep on hopping the bridge
But It's not gonna get us what we need
Know your weight in streets
Cause what else can we do
That'll make them see
No insurance no pill
Not the part of the plan
That you've got that'll multiply then  divide
Multiply and divide
(That's right)
Multiply and divide
(multiply and divide)
Multiply and divide
(That's right)
Multiply and divide

Stop!
Get your head around me
You've got to think about it
Look!
At what's going on around you
Learn!
How to think things through
And things that you can do to fight
They'll divide then multiplyEmbed
