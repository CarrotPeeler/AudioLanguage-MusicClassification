1 ContributorI.O.U. Lyrics
Don't you think that I had to let you go?
The end was coming, don't pretend you didn't know
I worked too long and it all went wrong
Oh, oh
I can hope, but you've been standin' out of the matter
I know you saw that I can make you feel alright
Want things that can stop my heart
All said, I'm gonna do my part

Push into my fingers, baby
Oh, all those tears will drive you crazy
I'm not saying we're not through
But I should spend this I.O.U, and
Let's not argue with both our broken hearts
One more time let me rock you 'til you walk out the door
Da, da

We were burning everything but one, you know
We did better when the lights were low
And now I don't wanna see you but you still look good
Through it all you know I saved a piece for you
On the tip of where we hid the morning view
So the end doesn't feel so hard
All said, I'm gonna do my part
You might also like
Push into my fingers, baby
Oh, I know I can drive you crazy
Push into my fingers, baby
Oh, all those tears will drive you crazy
I don't mean that we're not through
But I could spend this night with you, and
Never mind if we can't be friends in time, I'll
Make it burn one more time before you walk out the door

Do do do do do, do do do
Oh, do do do do do, do do doEmbed
