18 ContributorsLondon Lyrics
Smoke lingers 'round your fingers
Train, heave on to Euston

Do you think you've made
The right decision this time?
Ohh

You've left your tired family grieving
And you think they're sad because you're leaving
But did you see the jealousy in the eyes
Of the ones who had to stay behind?

And do you think you've made
The right decision this time?

You've left your girlfriend on the platform
With this really ragged notion that you'll return
But she knows that "When he goes, he really goes"

And do you think you've made
The right decision this time?You might also like4Embed
