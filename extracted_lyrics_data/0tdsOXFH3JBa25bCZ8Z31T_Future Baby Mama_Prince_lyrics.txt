I've heard it said my lovers look alike
Could it be that I was looking for you?
They were cool, but something wasn't right
They had me fooled for a minute and then I saw the truth

None of them got what it takes
To be a future baby mama
Gotta bend in the wind, but don't break
To keep your man
Show me one of them and I'll make her mine
With no more drama
Future baby mama

I've heard it said I won't treat you right
(You know that ain't right)
But they ain't sure, 'cause they don't know nothing about you
(You know you want me)
You're too secure to ever wanna fuss and fight
(That's right)
That's why your man never ever got a reason to doubt you

None of them got what it takes
To be a future baby mama, hey
Gotta bend in the wind, but don't break
To keep your man, hey hey hey
Show me one of them and I'll make her mine
With no more drama
Future baby mama
You might also like
Yeah, I know you might be fine, but I've seen it all before
Cinderella was a waste of time and, oops, she's out the door
To build a house together, the thing that matters more
Is under the floor
A strong foundation that lasts forever more

I want to make you happy, baby (Oh, yes)
Happier than happy itself (Oh, yes)
You know what?
If you'll ever need a hand, call me I'll help
'Cause I got you, anywhere you wanna go, uh huh (Oh yes)
Paris, London, Africa, San Lucas Mexico, you see
I know what you want ( know, I know)
What every good woman wants
A man so in love with you
He can't help but to flaunt you
Deep down I know what you want
You want your girlfriends to hate you
'Cause they can't get your man

None of them got what it takes
To be a future baby mama
Gotta bend in the wind, but don't break
To keep your man
Show me one of them and I'll make her mine
With no more drama
Future baby mama, well well
Future baby mama
Future baby mama
Baby mama
