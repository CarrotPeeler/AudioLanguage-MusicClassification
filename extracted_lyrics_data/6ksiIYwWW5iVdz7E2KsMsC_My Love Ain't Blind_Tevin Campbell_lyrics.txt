Ooh-oh-ooh, ooh-oh-ooh
Over now
Ooh-hoo, oh
My love ain't blind, baby

Did you think that you could get away
Telling lies, playing games, running around on me?
I can't believe
You were giving my love away
Tryna creep but baby don't sleep on me
My love ain't blind, baby

Just the other night
After making love with me
You said that I fulfilled your every need
Baby, you got on the phone
Thinking I was fast asleep
Telling someone else what you had just told me

Did you think that you could get away
Telling lies, playing games, running around on me?
I can't believe (No)
You were giving my love away
Tryna creep but baby don't sleep on me
My love ain't blind, baby
You might also like
While you were tryna creep
Whatever led you to believe
That you could ever run a game on me
Thought I was too blind to see
Somehow curiosity
Made it clear to me
And now you're history

You said that you would be (You said)
My everything (You know you lied)
How could you lie to me (You know you lied)
There's no playing the cheat (You can't play me, baby)
Why can't you see
My love ain't blind, baby

Did you think that you could get away
Telling lies, playing games, running around on me?
I can't believe (Oh baby)
You were giving my love away
Tryna creep but baby don't sleep on me
My love ain't blind, baby

After all I've done for you
How could you be so untrue?
I'm no longer down, it's over now
What goes around comes around again, yeah, oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
I can't believe you
Don't sleep on me, don't sleep on me, baby
Did you think that you could get away
Telling lies, playing games, running around on me?
I can't believe (Oh, I can't believe)
You were giving my love away (Running around on me)
Tryna creep but baby don't sleep on me (Ooh, ooh yeah)
My love ain't blind, baby
Did you think that you could get away
Telling lies, playing games, running around on me?
(Telling lies and playing games)
I can't believe (Oh-ho-ho-oh-oh)
You were giving my love away
Tryna creep but baby don't sleep on me (Don't sleep)
My love ain't blind, baby (Don't sleep, don't sleep, no)
Did you think that you could get away
Telling lies, playing games, running around on me?
I can't believe (No, no, no)
You were giving my love away (No, no, no; no, no, no)
Tryna creep but baby don't sleep on me (No, no, no; no, no, no)
My love ain't blind, babyEmbed
