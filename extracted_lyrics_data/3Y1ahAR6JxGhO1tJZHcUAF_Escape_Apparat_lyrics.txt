3 ContributorsEscape Lyrics
The street was rushing beneath
This is the fastest way I know
Where all the cars move backwards
And giant alley trees will grow again

I cut across the city's backyards
Counting cracks along the concrete
A burst open spider web
And every blade of grass will make me sneer

When all the fields dried up
Tens of comfortable years ago
I made this journey once before
And the city fed me long enough

To put a weight around the middle
This is apparent affluence
Left in a pack when I was little
Then I got pulled apart from closest friends

There was a door on my horizon
And silver sparkling rays were pouring in
So I sneaked away on soft hands
Another world in the making
