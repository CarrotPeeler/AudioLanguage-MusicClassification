1 ContributorWill I Be Ready LyricsHey friend it won't be too long now
'til the fire comes to town
And leads us underground
Hey girl the city will eat you alive
And leave the faintest burn mark
On the dirty city sidewalk
And will I be ready
When I hunt them down like dogs
And will I just listen
When they're quoting me their laws
And will I be ready
When I hunt them down like dogs
And will I just listen
When they're quoting me their laws
Hey y'all it's not like nobody warned us
We roast upon the fire
Of aggressive imperial desire
Hey friend I see you down the road
The road that's strewn with ashes
And burnt child's eyelashes
And will I be ready
When I hunt them down like dogs
And will I just listen
When they're quoting me their laws
And will I be ready
When I hunt them down like dogs
And will I just listen
When they're quoting me their laws
And will I be ready
When I hunt them down like dogs
And will I just listen
When they're quoting me their laws
And will I be ready
When I hunt them down like dogs
And will I just listen
When they're quoting me their laws
And will i be ready
When I have to do the deed
With a long splendid sword
And balanced honesty
And will I be ready
And will I just listen
Or will I be ready
Or will I just listen
Or will I be ready
Hell yeah I'll be ready
Yeah I'll be ready
No I will not listen
