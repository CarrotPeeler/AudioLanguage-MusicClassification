1 ContributorReady Or Not Lyrics
I got something for you
But you ain't checking for me
And you know that's true
Every time that I call
Just got a second for me
We'll make the spirit move

Ready or not, here I come
And if you hear the thunder roar
That's my base in my drum
And if you're tryna hide
? at your side
So you better be wise
I'm coming, oh!

This could be the last dance, last dance!
What you gonna do when the music is through?
Tell the DJ it's the last dance, last dance!
I think you know that I'm talking to you

(Yeah!)
I've been jealous a long time
Since I've been waiting for you, you, you
Every time was the wrong time
And I was ? on the move
You might also like
Ready or not, here I come
And if you hear the thunder roar
That's my base in my drum
And if you're tryna hide
? at your side
So you better be wise
I'm coming, oh!

This could be the last dance, last dance!
What you gonna do when the music is through?
Tell the DJ it's the last dance, last dance!
I think you know that I'm talking to you
Oh right now, now, now, now!

I don't care what they say
I don't care what they do
I don't care what the crowd is thinking
Caught in the shadow
It's time for the light
In the morning, the warning
Like a peep in the night, ready or not!

I got something for you
But you ain't checking for me
And you know that's true
Every time that I call
Just got a second for me
We'll make the spirit move
Ready or not, here I come
And if you hear the thunder roar
That's my base in my drum
And if you're tryna hide
? at your side
So you better be wise
I'm coming, oh!

This could be the last dance, last dance!
What you gonna do when the music is through?
Tell the DJ it's the last dance, last dance!
I think you know that I'm talking to you (alright!)

Ready or not, here I come
You can't hide, gonna find you
Ready or not, here I come
You can't hide, gonna find you

This could be the last dance, last dance!
What you gonna do when the music is through?
Tell the DJ it's the last dance, last dance!
I think you know that I'm talking to you (alright!)
This could be the last dance, last dance!
What you gonna do when the music is through?
Tell the DJ it's the last dance, last dance!
I think you know that I'm talking to you (alright!)
Hey, hey, hey!
What you gon' tonight?
Hey, hey, hey!
If I come through tonight
Hey, hey, hey!
I might just keep like a tonight
I'm coming ready or not  (yeah!)Embed
