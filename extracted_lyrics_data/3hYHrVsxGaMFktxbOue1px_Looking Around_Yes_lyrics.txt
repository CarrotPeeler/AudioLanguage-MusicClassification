10 ContributorsLooking Around Lyrics
Looking around me
There's not so much in life I miss
Things that I can't see
I'll touch and I'll feel then I'll kiss
Then I saw you standing there
With a smile I couldn't share
Just looking around everywhere

Tunes that I can't hear
Would take me for a while my smile
Fares that are too dear
I'd rather walk out another mile
Then I heard a tune so right
It was in the dark of night
Just listening around everywhere

All the things I've wanted to do
Take so much time to get around to you
Just reach out and catch and hold on
Leaving trails of dust and lust
Never even lying or trying, keep on moving, never dying

You might also like
Smiles that I don't see
I'll make them up as I go on
Laughs that just can't be
I'll make and laugh at every one
Then I saw you in your place
With a laugh upon your face
Just looking around everywhere

All the things I've wanted to do
Take so much time to get around to you
Just reach out and catch and hold on
Leaving trails of dust and lust
Never even lying or trying, keep on moving, never dying


Looking around with my feet on the ground
Full of words and of sound, bringing smiles all around
Satisfy me with your words that can be
Full of sound and I'll see I'm just looking aroundEmbed
