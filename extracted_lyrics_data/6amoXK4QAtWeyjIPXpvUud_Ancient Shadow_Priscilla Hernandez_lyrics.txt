1 ContributorAncient Shadow LyricsAncient shadow, come!
I feel your spirit is around
I feel your cold breath on my cheeks!
I am hopeless, in despair
Lift my head and see you're not there
Once I saw your radiant face
I fell in love and lost my head
Please, don't let me think you don't care
Oh Ancient shadow, come to me!
Whisper love words in my ears
Sigh and sing and let me feel
Take away this hollow fear away from me
Ancient shadow, come!
Light this darkness, Come!
Soar through the night on spectral wings!
Here's where my journey begins
Give to me the gift of light
Oh, Dream-weaver from the past
Heal my broken heart with your love
Once I saw your sparkling eyes
Freezing flames shining inside
Trapped my soul within your sight
Ancient shadow, come to me
Knock on my door. I'll let you in
Hold my hands, please don't leave me
Scratch my walls and let me know
You're standing very close... to me

Whisper love words in my ears
Oh, come back. Oh please don't leave me
Sigh and sing and let me feel
Take away this hollow fear away from me
Ancient shadow, come!
I'm still waiting, come!
I'm still waiting! Ancient shadow come!Embed
