Everybody is important to someone
VIPs is what we are, you and me are superstars
Everybody is important to this world
People everywhere, no matter who you are
We're VIPs and everybody counts
Childrens and parents, they're VIPs
Brothers and sisters, they're VIPs
Fathers and mothers, they're VIPs
Lovers to lovers, they're VIPs
Women to men, they're VIPs
Friends to friends, they're VIPs
Family and loved ones, they're VIPs
And everybody's ONE!
Everybody's free, to be a V.I.P
Everybody is important to someone
People in your life, lovers husbands wifes
Everybody is special to your life
Making, baking bread, oh, sis, mom and dad
Everybody is important to your day
Everybody's free, to be a V.I.P
Everybody is important to someone
Childrens and parents, they're VIPs
Brothers and sisters, they're VIPs
Fathers and mothers, they're VIPs
Lovers to lovers, they're VIPs
Women to men, they're VIPs
