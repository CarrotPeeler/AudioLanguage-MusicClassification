1 ContributorOG (people we meet) LyricsOG
Said I was busy
Never really cared about the job only the lizzie
And know I'm working way too hard to get me to the city
And had a lot of options I can take I'm way too picky
I was just, tryna find a girl to make my missy
And I was just walking in my timbs
Cause I'm the type of guy who would like the finer things
In my life, losing my sight, I'm on ice
Cause your friends become the coldest when you're working in the night time
Would do a lot of things to do a 9-5
A regular life, I got a wife I
Stay connected through the phone and through the wifi
And theres pictures of us, you love the time line
That ain't fitted for me, living a dream
I had a chick who listen for weeks, she never meet
It was peak, wasting my time, I wanted peace
To focus on my grind that's a lesson that they teach

And I'm talking bout the people we meet
Every single persons got a lesson to teach
When we speak, I ain't seen the things that you seen
Gotta keep it real, ain't the same as the screen
And I'm talking bout the people we meet
Every single persons got a lesson to teach
When we speak, I ain't seen the things that you seen
Gotta keep it real, ain't the same as the screen
You might also like
And you know how it goes
It's the same old same old I was on my toes
Distracted by women and when I'm slipping on my woes
Turning that energy into winning when I'm low
On a different level was finished with all the smoke
And playing games like you think I'm a baby?
And she wanted that, hazy, bake me
But I ain't mess with plans unless they're turning me to Jay z
Send a message or you hit me on the gram time is precious I ain't deal another gram
And I ain't do a show unless I'm leaving with a grand
Speak it to reality just need to see the plan never be here if i wasn't messed with in the first place
Shout out the girl who wouldn't text me on my birthday
And know I'm worthy, to everyone I meet
Cause I was just a soul, searching for peace

And I'm talking bout the people we meet
Every single persons got a lesson to teach
When we speak, I ain't seen the things that you seen
Gotta keep it real, ain't the same as the screen
And I'm talking bout the people we meet
Every single persons got a lesson to teach
When we speak, I ain't seen the things that you seen
Gotta keep it real, ain't the same as the screenEmbed
