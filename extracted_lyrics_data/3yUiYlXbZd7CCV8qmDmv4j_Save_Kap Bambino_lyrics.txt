I would like to tell you!
That nothing is finished
We did not say our last word...
We will shout our despair
In front of misery!
I want to give you the forces
I want to give you the forces
Because I can do nothing
I would like to tell you!
That nothing is finished
We did not say our last word...
We will shout our despair
In front of misery!
I want to give you the forces
I want to give you the forces
We will shout our despair
In front of misery!
Save Save Save Save Save Save (x8)
