3 ContributorsIn Passing LyricsTime goes by so very slow while you are fasting
I don't think I really know if you are asking
Crash the plane and boil the snow then do the last thing
Picture of a piece of wood stuck to the plastic
Declarations spoken low and said in passing
You're the one I used to know I hear you laughing
If I knew that you were coming
I'd have stayed awake
If you knew where you were going
I'd be interested
Miles of fields and it's snowing
On a frozen lake
If I knew that you were coming
I'd have stayed awake
Time to die, You're welcome, You just overstayed it
I simplify the card was dealt before you played it
Your sense of community is kinda dated
Taking care Jerusalem is locked and gated
Making sure we all hate who we always hated
Till your lust for blood is well and truly sated
If I knew that you were coming
I'd have stayed awake
If you knew where you were going
I'd be interested
Miles of fields and it's snowing
On a frozen lake
If I knew that you were coming
I'd have stayed awakeYou might also likeEmbed
