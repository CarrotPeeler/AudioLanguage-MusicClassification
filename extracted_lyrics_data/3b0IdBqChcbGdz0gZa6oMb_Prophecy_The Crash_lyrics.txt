1 ContributorProphecy Lyrics
Nevertheless a god will call
Nevertheless the freaks will fall
And all that we've wanted is there at the door
Everlasting human home
Everlasting rise of Rome
Oh no, this fever could take down the world

Who has been stealing our feelings?
Now some of us will fall and one of us will fool you, oh yeah
Fool you, oh yeah

Nevertheless we'll understand
Nevertheless we'll hold our hands
Our faceless machinery will reign over man
Everlasting unity
Perfect immunity
Oh, it's a wonderful, wonderful world

Who has been stealing our feelings?
Now some of us will fall and one of us will fool you, oh yeah
You might also likeFool you, oh yeah

Nevertheless the fame will frown
And turn us to freaky clowns
You'll see us in Disneylands faking the funEmbed
