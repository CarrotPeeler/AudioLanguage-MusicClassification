4 ContributorsOn a Night Like This (Bini & Martini Club Mix) Lyrics
Don't say it's like a fantasy
When you know this is how it should be

You kiss me, I'm falling
Can you hear me calling?
You touch me, I want you
Feels like I've always known you

On a night like this
I wanna stay forever (stay forever)
On a night like this
Just wanna be together
On a night like this

Now I'm getting closer to you
Hold me, I just can't be without you

You kiss me, I'm falling
It's your name I'm calling
You touch me, I want you
Feels like I've always known you

On a night like this
I wanna stay forever (stay forever)
On a night like this
Just wanna be together
On a night like this

Seems I've known you a lifetime
Now it's time to make you mine
On a night like this
(You kiss me, I'm falling, you touch me, I want you)
(You kiss me, I'm falling, you touch me, I want you)
(You kiss me, I'm falling, you touch me, I want you)
(You kiss me, I'm falling, you touch me, I want you)

You kiss me, I'm falling
Can you hear me calling?
You touch me, I want you
Feels like I've always known you

On a night like this
I wanna stay forever (stay forever)
On a night like this
Just wanna be together
On a night like this
On a night like this
I wanna stay forever (stay forever)
On a night like this
Just wanna be together (oh)
On a night like this

On a night like this
On a night like thisEmbed
