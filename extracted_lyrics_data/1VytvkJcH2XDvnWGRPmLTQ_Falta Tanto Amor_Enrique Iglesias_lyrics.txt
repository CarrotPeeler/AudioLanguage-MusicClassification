Dime quien es
No me puedes mentir
Te has enamorado de el
No lo quieres decir
Donde fue que te hizo sentir
Dime que te pudo dar
Que yo no te di

Que puedo hacer se todo
Es terminado
Que puedo hacer se has
Me abandonado

Falta tanto amor
Entre tu y yo
Ya me has olvidado
Falta tanto amor
Entre tu y yo
Otro has encontrado

Dime quien es
Ya no puedes fingir
Esas lagrimas que caen no son para mi
You might also likeAdonde fue que te hizo sentir
Dime que te pudo dar
Que yo no te di

Que puedo hacer
Si ya lo has decidido
Que puedo hacer
Si todo esta perdido

Falta tanto amor
Entre tu y yo
Ya me has olvidado

Falta tanto amor
Entre tu y yo
Otro has encontrado
So much love lost
Tell me who he is
You can't lie to me
You are in love with him
You don't want to say
Where was it that he made you feel
Tell me what he gave you
That I didn't give you
What can I do if everything
Has ended?
What can I do if you have
Abandoned me?

So much love lost
Between you and me
You've already forgotten me
So much love lost
Between you and me
That another has found


Tell me who he is
Now you can't pretend
These tears that fall are not for me
Where was it that he made you feel?
Tell me what he gave you
That I didn't give you
What can I do - if you've already decided?
What can I do -
If everything is lost?
