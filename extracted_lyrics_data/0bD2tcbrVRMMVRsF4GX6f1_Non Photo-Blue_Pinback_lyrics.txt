4 ContributorsNon Photo-Blue LyricsShe's posting all the time
But the boards are down, it's a burnt-out building
He's spending all his time
On his back, staring at the ceiling
They spend themselves that way
I'm with that, I'm with them
You aren't, you are alive, dammit
Gnawing on the prey
I think about you some
Where to put you?
All the backed up data
For a raining time
Insulate a fragile mind
Capsulize a broken find
Don't do this man, there's another one off behind
Breaking down the door without warning
Don't do this man, there's another one off behind
Breaking down the door without warning
Don't do this man, there's another one off behind
Breaking down the door without warning
Don't do this man, there's another one off behind
Breaking down the door without warning
She just ignores the time
The boards came down, it's a numbed out feeling
He just accepts that pain
With a hate mantra, a spiritual killing
They just relax that way
I'm with that, I'm with them
You aren't, you are alive, dammit

Crossword filled in non-photo blue
So they'll never find you
I get the same result
We get the same effect
I get the same result
We get the same effect
Can't go through this now
I'm leaving a message
Stapled on your head
Don't do this man, there's another one off behind
Breaking down the door without warning
Don't do this man, there's another one off behind
Breaking down the door without warning
Don't do this man, there's another one off behind
Breaking down the door without warning
Don't do this man, there's another one off behind
Breaking down the door without warning3Embed
