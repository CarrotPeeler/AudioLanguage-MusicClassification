Steamy like a winter storm
Softer than the sharpest thorn
I held your hand and I was born
So explain your fury, you were never scorned

You made me feel the way I felt
You can do me wrong, babe
But make it feel, make it feel

Softly, softly, show me you care
Easy, easy, keep me right there
Would you ever if I double dared?
Hurt me harshly, destroy me with care
And make the first slice like I first cut you
Oh baby, why you wanna just hurt me like you do?
Softly, softly, show me you care
Easy, easy, keep me right there (Keep me right there)
Would you ever if I doubled dared? (If I double dared)
Hurt me harshly, destroy me with care


Softly, softly (Softly) show me you care (Show me you care)
Easy, easy, keep me right there (Keep me right there)
Never, ever, ever you dare
Hurt me harshly, destroy me with care
You might also like
Tell me, baby
Oh, oh, softly, baby (Oh yeah, yeah, yeah)
Oh yeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Ooh, oh, oh)
(Oh) Steamy like a winter storm
Softer than the sharpest thorn (Softer)
I held your hand and I was born
Softly, softly, destroy me with care, yeahEmbed
