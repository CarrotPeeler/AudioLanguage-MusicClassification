2 ContributorsHad A Bad Night LyricsOh, I had a bad night last night
People you know things just didn't go right
I had a bad, bad, bad night last night
People you know things just didn't go right
You know I lost all my money on the boat
And I'm standing here to tell you all I'm down so broke
I got a call from my baby this morning
Said Buddy you know you just gotta pay
I got a call from my baby this morning, yeah
It said Buddy you just gotta pay
I shook my head and said
People you know this just ain't my day
Oh I went in to a friend of mine
And he was broke, busted and disgusting
Yes, I went to a friend of mine
And he was broke, busted and disgusted
And all he did was shook his had and walked away
And said Buddy Guy, this just ain't my day
That makes two of usYou might also likeEmbed
