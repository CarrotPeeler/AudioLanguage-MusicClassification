1 ContributorThe Roll Off Characteristics (Of History in the Making) Lyrics
It's the roll off characteristics
Of history in the making
Of all that has gone before
And of all that’s for the taking
It's the roll off characteristics
Of history in the making
The roll off characteristics
Of history in the making

Winners will never be losers
And losers will never win
Winners will never be losers
It's history in the making

It’s the roll off characteristics
Of history in the making
Of all that's in the pantry
The good cooking my mamma's making
It's the roll off characteristics
Of history in the making
Of all that has gone before
The honeycomb in  baking

In 1974, in his state address to Congress
 stated that the world would be tested
By Texas Instrument and English diction
He's not with us now, but the years have had their say

It's the roll off characteristics
Of history in the making
Of all that has gone before
And of all that's left for the taking
War ain't nothing but that technical blip-blop
War ain’t nothing but that technical blip-blop
A drop drop
War ain’t nothing but that technical blip-blop
War ain't nothing but that technical blip-blop
It’s history in the making

It's the roll off characteristics
Of history in the making
Of all that has gone before
And of all that's for the taking
I kept cookingEmbed
