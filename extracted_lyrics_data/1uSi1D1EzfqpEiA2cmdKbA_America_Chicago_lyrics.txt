America, America is free
America
America is you and me

Ooh
The dream is fading before our eyes
Take some time to revive it
"We the people" must start right now
Don't expect our leaders to show us how
They don't have a clue what to do
If they knew how to stop the slide
We'd have seen some signs by now
To turn back the tide

Here in America
America is free
America
America is you and me

We can't keep havin' you make our rules
When you treat us common folk like fools
It's time we stand up for our rights
Put Congress in our political sights
Make them pass laws that help us all
The founding fathers echo will be heard in the hall
By the people, for the people, everyone equal
'Cause this is
You might also like
America, America is free
America
Everyone's free
America, America is free
America
America is you and me

Our declaration tell us we're all free and equal
No religion, no color, just people
No one better, no one worse
Everyone comes first (Comes first)


Time to unite as a nation
Go all in with no hesitation
Let's not shy away from what's right
Let's not shy away from the fight
If we work together
At a steady pace
We will make the land we love
Abetter place
A better
America
America is free
America
America is you and me

You and me
You and me
You-ooh oh
You and meEmbed
