4 ContributorsBlu is a Mood Lyrics
I don't do much talkin'
I do a lot of singin'
Yeah, oh-oh
Yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah

When you're feelin' kinda melancholy (So blu)
And ya get somethin' never thought about
Outta nowhere (Out of the blue)
Once in a while, there's a special moon (The blue moon)
And a clear sky colored pale azure
They all have something in common (Whoa)

State of mind
Color
Way beyond (Way beyond)
Yonder (Yonder)
Deeper (Deeper)
Paradise (Paradise)
All describe
Blu is a mood (Blu is just a mood)

So bright, it can be electric
Or indigo, cobalt, powder, or Paris
Have it any way you like (You like)
Stones of metamorphic sapphirine
From the heavens down to the deepest sea
It's in every part of your life
Do you feel it?
You might also like

Blu is a mood (Blu is just a mood)

Blu's not just a primary color (Yeah, yeah)
It's a backdrop for the universe
So if you're vibin' on this chill atmosphere
Baby, you have been blue
Blu is just a mood

Yeah, Blu is just a mood, yeah, oh-oh
Color, oh-oh
It's a rainbow
Blu is just a mood
Yeah, play that organ for me
'Cause blu is just a mood
