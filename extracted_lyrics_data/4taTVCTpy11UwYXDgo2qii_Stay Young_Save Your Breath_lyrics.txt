I listened to your song today
Somehow it just didn't sound the same
The melody seemed strange
The words they all just felt so fake
We can see your true colours now
Seems you've been blinded by summer somehow
Bridge
I hate to say..but you just threw it all away
Chorus
Stay Young
Stop looking for answers when you need better questions
(and know that you should..)
Verse 2
They're still out there playing
Its weighing heavy on their backs
Cause everything you said you stood for is everything you lack
When it starts to show the cracks are setting in
Your lying to yourself this time if you think its everything
When it starts to show the cracks are setting in
So many times you moored the line and the spot light dragged you in
Bridge
I hate to say..but you just threw it all away
Chorus
Stay Young
Stop looking for answers when you need better questions
(and know that you should..)
Middle 8
I guess you must be going deaf
Or your just listening to your friends less
I guess it must have gone to your head
Or your just thinking of your friends less
(Stay Young, Stay Careless)
Chorus
Stay Young
Stop looking for answers when you need better questions
(and know that you should..)
And better yourselfYou might also likeEmbed
