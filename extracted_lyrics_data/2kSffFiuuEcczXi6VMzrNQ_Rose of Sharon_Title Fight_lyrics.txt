14 ContributorsRose of Sharon Lyrics
Lately life moves slowly
I stop to smell a rose
Inhale, press its thorns
Against my nose

Stood in one place
Careless change

Can't escape
I'm a part of you
Engraved in the stone
Do you feel it too?

Stood in one place, restrained
Roses like me need rain

Try hard not to care
The world won't cease to turn
A name you didn't choose
Is left in place of you
Can't escape
Careless changeYou might also like6Embed
