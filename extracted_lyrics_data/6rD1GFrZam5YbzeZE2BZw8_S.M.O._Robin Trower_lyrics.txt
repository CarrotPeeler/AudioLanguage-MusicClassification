Feel so bad, just like a ballgame on a rainy day
Since I lost my baby
I shake my head and walk away
Sometimes I wanna leave here, then again I wanna stay
Sometimes I wanna leave here, then again I wanna stay
I just can't make my mind up
Shake my head and walk away
I'm trying to tell you people, tell you exactly how I feel
I'm trying to tell you people, tell you exactly how I feel
I just can't keep from cryin'
My baby gave me a dirty dealSee Robin Trower LiveGet tickets as low as $68You might also likeEmbed
