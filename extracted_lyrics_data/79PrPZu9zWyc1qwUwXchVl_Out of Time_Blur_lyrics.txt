25 ContributorsOut of Time Lyrics
Where's the love song to set us free?
Too many people down
Everything turning the wrong way 'round
And I don't know what love would be
But if we stop dreaming now
Lord knows we'd never clear the clouds

And you've been so busy lately
That you haven't found the time to open up your mind
And watch the world spinning gently out of time

Feel the sunshine on your face
It's in a computer now
Gone to the future way out in space

And you've been so busy lately
That you haven't found the time to open up your mind
And watch the world spinning gently out of time


And you've been so busy lately
That you haven't found the time to open up your mind
And watch the world spinning gently out of time
Tell me I'm not dreaming but are we out of time?
You might also like
We're out of time
Out of time
Out of time
Out of time
Out of time11Embed
