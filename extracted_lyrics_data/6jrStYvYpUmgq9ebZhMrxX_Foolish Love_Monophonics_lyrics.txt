3 ContributorsFoolish Love LyricsI feel your touch, but you've been gone some time
I see your face, but that's only in my mind
So I do what I can, just to get you back
Cause I just can't shake you so get my life on track
Oh my my, I miss you so much
And the way you held me tight
Oh why why, is it so tough?
Cause I can't seem to break away from your foolish love
Oh you got me where you want me
Oh I can't stop this feeling
I'm just a fool for you woman
These games got me dizzy
Girl I won't down
I can't take anymore of this love merry-go-round
I don't know what else to do, just to get you back
Cause you don't love me no more and that's a fact
Oh my my, I miss you so much
And the way you held me tight
Oh why why, is it so tough?
Cause I can't seem to break away from your foolish love
Oh you got me where you want me
Oh I can't stop this feeling
Oh I'm just a fool for you baby
And you got me where you want me
No I can't stop this feeling
I'm just a fool for you woman
No I can't help my heart, no no

I've had enough of heartbreak for far too long
But no man would ???
Even in fifty years it's quite the choice I've made
Oh my my, I miss you so much
And the way you held me tight
Oh why why, is it so tough?
Cause I can't seem to break away from your foolish love
Oh you got me where you want me
Oh I can't stop this feeling
I'm a fool for you baby
Yeah you got me where you want me
No I can't stop this feeling I got
I'm a fool for you honey baby
Ain't nothing gon' help my heart, no noEmbed
