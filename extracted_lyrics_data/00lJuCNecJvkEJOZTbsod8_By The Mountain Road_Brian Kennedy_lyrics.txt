2 ContributorsBy the Mountain Road Lyrics
Anyone who's ever lived inside of anybody else's heart
Will know
The price you pay, the time it takes, the mess you make
Oh, oh

Anyone can go
By the mountain road
But you're on your own

Every time I hear a saxophone I think of all the people in my life
I've known
And every time I hear a train I think of all the years I've been away
From home

Anyone can go
By the mountain road
But you're on your own

All my dreams grow cold
(Remember how we used to never, ever really care)
In this life I hold
You might also like

Anyone who's ever lived inside of anybody else's heart
Will know
Oh, the price you pay, the pain and ache, the mess you make
Oh, oh

Anyone can go
Anyone can go
Where I first let go
By the mountain road
Anyone can go
Anyone can go
But you're on your own
By the mountain road
But you're on your ownEmbed
