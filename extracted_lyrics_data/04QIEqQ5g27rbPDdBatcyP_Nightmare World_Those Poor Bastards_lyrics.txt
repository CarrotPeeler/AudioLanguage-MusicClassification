1 ContributorNightmare World LyricsLet us meet beside the field
That stretches across the nightmare world
There it rains the coldest rain
But there we'll meet again, again
I know in my heart it's hopeless
I know in my heart it's hopeless
Let us dive into the stream
That flows across the nightmare field
There the water shines like glass
And there we'll meet again, again
I know in my heart it's hopeless
I know in my heart it's hopeless
I see God up in the sky
Looking down at our nightmare world
I feel His breath right on my skin
He says we'll meet again, again
I know in my heart it's hopeless
I know in my heart it's hopelessYou might also likeEmbed
