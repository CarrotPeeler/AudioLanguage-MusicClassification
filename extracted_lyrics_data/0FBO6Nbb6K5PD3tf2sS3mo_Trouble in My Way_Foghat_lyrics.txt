1 ContributorTrouble In My Way LyricsPeverett - Knee Trembler Music - ASCAP
Trouble in my way, trouble in my way
Only the darkness can ease the pain
Only the shadows hide my shame
Standin' in the rain, standin' in the rain
Look at the people drivin' home
I'm so tired of bein' alone
Oh I know, yes I know trouble in my way
Give me one more chance, give me one more chance
I'll tell you something you're bound to hate
Maybe tomorrow will be too late
Trouble in my way, trouble in my way
Only the darkness can ease my pain
Only the shadows hide my shame
Oh I know, yes I know trouble in my way
Trouble in my way, trouble in my way
Trouble, trouble in my way
Oh I know, yes I know trouble in my way
