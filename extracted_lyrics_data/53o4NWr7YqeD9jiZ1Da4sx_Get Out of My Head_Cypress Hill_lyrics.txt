6 ContributorsGet Out of My Head Lyrics
Uh..uh...yeah....
These voices up in my head...

All these voices up in my head
Makin' me dread, when I sleep at night
Visons of people with evil intensions wanna fly my sight
Visons are changin', engagin', and ragin', I'm in a stage and a fight
Listen, the system is pissin' me off, you wanna feel my pipe?
Fingers pointed, anointed people, they better run to the light
Whispers in darkness, the hardest time ain't never gonna feel alright
Feelin' my soul in the hole
I can't breathe, and I'm frightened for my life
Think I need help 'fore I dwell in hell, 'cause I got a grip too tight!

Will you ever get out of my head?
Will you ever get out of my head?
Will you ever get out of my head?
Will you ever get out of my head?

Through every dimension, there's tension ahead, I gotta go my way
Dreams are like beams of light coming through my brain
Then I know I'm baked
For every single minute that's in it, each and every brand new day
Denial of trial, I'm vile, whatever that bullshit they say
I'm sinking so low in myself, help me, they never give no break
Confusion is usin' me, sinkin' me up, now the sky's all grey
I'm blazin' and liftin' my mind with kite, let me hit that J
Holding, controlling myself over, but the shit won't stay!

Will you ever get out of my head?
Will you ever get out of my head?
Will you ever get out of my head?
Will you ever get out of my head? (Will you ever get out of my head!)
Will you ever get out of my head? ( Will you ever get out of my head!)
Will you ever get out of my head? (Will you ever get out of my head!)
Will you ever get out of my head? (Will you ever get out of my head!)Embed
