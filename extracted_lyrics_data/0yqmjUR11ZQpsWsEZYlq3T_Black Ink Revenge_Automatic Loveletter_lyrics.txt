4 ContributorsBlack Ink Revenge LyricsI wanted this
I wanted you
I wanted it to last
But you fell through
Now east coast boys
Don't you see
That here on the west we follow our dreams
I don't wanna know you anymore
The color of your lips are red
And I swear I never wear lipstick
And oh my god I drank too much
Laughing while I'm crying
Don't you let 'em know you're dying, dying
Dying to break out
Dying to get, get, get out
Through the window of the upstairs
Click my heels but I am stuck here
I'm pledging this vow
This is the last time
This is the last fight
Sunsets to sunrise
Morning to midnight
And this is my goodbye
So blow out the candle
The bottle is dry
And these pages learn to think
You're not even worth my
Black ink revenge
I guarantee, guarantee you'll miss me
You might also likeI can't stomach this
I think I'm going to be sick
My heart's made of wick and you put the fire out of it
With the kerosene
Chalked my feet
She smiled at me and closed the door
But not to sleep
This isn't making any sense
I was yours the night before this
The smell of your sheets is the remnants of it
This is the last time
This is the last fight
Sunsets to sunrise
Morning to midnight
And this is my goodbye
So blow out the candle
The bottle is dry
And these pages learn to think
You're not even worth my
Black ink revenge
So I'm writing you out of my dreams
And you'll miss me I swear when I leave
Yeah I'm writing you out
I'm crossing my T's
And I want back the necklace that I said you could keep
And you miscomprehend and I scorn you till death
My words are as strong as my last gasp for breath
Leave nothing behind
Not a trace or a crumb
And no clues to unlock how painful this was
So I'm writing you out of my dreams
And you'll miss me I swear when I leave
This is the last time
This is the last fight
Sunsets to sunrise
Morning to midnight
And this is my goodbye
So blow out the candle
The bottle is dry
And these pages learn to think
You're not even worth my1Embed
