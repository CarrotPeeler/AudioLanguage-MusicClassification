1 ContributorCall Me A Dog When Iâ€™m Gone LyricsCall me a dog when I'm gone, gone, gone
You call me a dog when I'm gone
But when I get back with a ten dollar bill
It's "Honey, where you been so long?"
Been all around old Kentucky and
The state of old Tennessee
And every place where I hang my hat
Is home sweet home to me
Daddy told me how to gamble
He taught me to play that jack and trey
Every time that the deal would go down
I'd look down on that deuce, ace and trey
Old black dog when I'm gone, gone, gone
You call me a dog when I'm gone
But when I get back with a ten dollar bill
It's "Honey, where you been so long?"
Whose gonna shoe your pretty little feet
Whose gonna glove your hand
Whose gonna kiss your rosy little cheeks
Tell me whose gonna be your man
Daddy will shoe my pretty little feet
Momma will glove my hand
Sister will kiss my rosy little cheeks
And I ain't gonna need a gambling man
You might also likeOld black dog when I'm gone, gone, gone
You call me a dog when I'm gone
But when I get back with a ten dollar bill
It's "Honey, where you been so long?"Embed
