6 ContributorsSoft in the Center Lyrics
Well, the hospital's gonna let you go
But the city's gonna stick around
Yeah, sure the stars are in the sky
But the money's still down on the ground
Man, if money didn't matter
Then I might tell you something new
You can't tell people what they want to hear
If you also want to tell the truth

And I'm just trying to tell the truth, kid
I'm just trying to tell the truth

You can't get every girl
You get the ones you love the best
You won't get every girl
You love the ones you get the best

I know bodies of water freeze over
I'm from a place with lots of lakes
But sometimes they get soft in the center
And the center is a dangerous place
It's been a long, cold winter
And now you're standing on unsafe ice
But you can probably do anything
If you could just go and get yourself right
You might also like
You gotta get yourself right, kid
I'm gonna give you some advice

You can't get every girl
You get the ones you love the best
You won't get every girl
You love the ones you get the best
Kid, you can't kiss every girl
You gotta trust me on this one
You gotta trust me on this one

I know what you're going through
I had to go through that, too
I know what you're going through
I had to go through that, too

You can't get every girl
You get the ones you love the best
You won't get every girl
You love the ones you get the best
You can't get every girl
You get the ones you love the best
You won't get every girl
You love the ones you get the best
I know what you're going throughEmbed
