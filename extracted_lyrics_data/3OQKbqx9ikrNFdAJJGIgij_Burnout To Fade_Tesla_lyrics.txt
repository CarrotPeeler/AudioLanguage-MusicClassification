It all became what it's become
No turning back, what's done is done
So I took it on, step by step, one by one
Cause some are lost and some are won

And do you recall?
The way I used to call your name?
And how you never ever came?
Now suddenly here you come

But it's too late, no chance for me
You can't accept or can't believe
No need to wait cause I moved on
I'm better here, just let it be
Burn out to fade
It fades away

Looking back to yesterday
When we were young, so unafraid
So I took it on
And had to choose the choice you made
They took it all and ran away

It fades away
It fades away
It fades away
Just go away
Go awayEmbed
