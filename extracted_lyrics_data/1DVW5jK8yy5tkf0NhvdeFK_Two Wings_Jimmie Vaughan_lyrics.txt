1 ContributorTwo Wings Lyrics

I got two wings (on my head)
I got two wings (on my feet)
I got two wings (on my hands)
I got two wings

I'm gonna fly, fly, fly (aly)
Way up in the sky (ah-ah-uuh)

I got two wings, to take you there
Past Jupiter and Mars
I got two wings, to take you there
Way beyond the stars
I got two wings

You got two wings (on your head)
You got two wings (on your feet)
You got two wings (on your hands)
You got two wings

You're gonna fly, fly, fly (fly, fly fly)
Way up in the sky (ah-ah-uh)
You might also like
You got two wings to take you there
Past Jupiter and Mars
You got two wings to take you there
Way beyond the stars
You got two wings

What's it gonna be
Over the mountain
Across the sea
You got two wings

(Two wings)
(Two wings)
(Ah-ah-uh)
(Two wings)
(Ah-ah-uh)

We got two wings (on our head)
Two wings (on our feet)
Two wings (on our hands)
We got two wings
We're gonna fly, fly, fly (fly, fly, fly)
Way up in the sky (Ah-ah-uh)

We got two wings, to take us there
Past Jupiter and Mars
Two wings, to take us there
Way bеyond the stars
We got two wings

Maybe wе'll stay
Way beyond the milky way
I got two wings (on my head)

(On my feet)
(On our head)
(On our hands)Embed
