Weak and strong
Oh, ever the hero you won't break
Weak and strong
Weak and strong
You've got to love your brother like you don't
Love yourself
You've got to change
You've got to love your brother like you don't
Love yourself
You've got to change
You've got to change
You think you're strong
Cutting off love like an amputee
You're not alone
We all want love without the grief
Oh, ever the hero you won't break
Weak and strong
Oh, ever the hero you won't break
You're not alone
We can relate to your insecurities
You think you're strong
Measure your courage in empathy
