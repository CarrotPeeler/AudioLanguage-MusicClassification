Remembering me
Discover and see
All over the world
She's known as a girl
To those who are free
Their minds shall be key
Forgotten as the past
'Cause history will last

God is a girl, wherever you are
Do you believe it, can you receive it?
God is a girl, whatever you say
Do you believe it, can you receive it?
God is a girl, however you live
Do you believe it, can you receive it?
God is a girl, she's only a girl
Do you believe it, can you receive it?


She wants to shine, forever in time
She is so driven, she's always mine
Clearly and free, she wanted to be
A part of the future, a girl like me
There is a sky illuminating us
Someone is out there that we truly trust
There is a rainbow for you and me
A beautiful sunrise eternally
You might also like
God is a girl, wherever you are
Do you believe it, can you receive it?
God is a girl, whatever you say
Do you believe it, can you receive it?
God is a girl, however you live
Do you believe it, can you receive it?
God is a girl, she's only a girl
Do you believe it, can you receive it?
