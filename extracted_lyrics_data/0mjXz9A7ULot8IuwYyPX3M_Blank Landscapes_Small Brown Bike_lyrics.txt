1 ContributorBlank Landscapes LyricsI miss myself more than anything
I can't go back to where I can be seen
No, not tonight
Sometimes I feel like I stayed home and slept
No one is here and my progress goes unchecked, but on this night
I can't lift this up
I wander through these blank landscapes
Searching I want to reach back
I want to return home now
I can see you standing there
(Can't forget about the others
Can't forgive for all of the others)
I can feel me falling here
The sleep I took tonight was stolen from ghosts who haunt
And I can't control them
No, not tonight
They make me feel like I'm just stalling out
I'm not the one and my fears are falling now, but on this night
I can't lift this upYou might also likeEmbed
