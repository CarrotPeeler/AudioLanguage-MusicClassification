1 ContributorNot That Kind LyricsIt’s coming in when it gets dark
It’s not the shame, it’s not a broken heart
It’s not a dripping tap in me
Why does it bother, why does it bother me?
The night was never meant to shine
But I keep hanging on to the times we set fire-
You won’t believe me, I keep this little life of mine
You couldn’t see me, how do you know what’s left behind?
It’s not that bad, it’s not that kind
I hardly notice through the day
On silent streets I hear it anyway
I’d make it stop oh if I could
Its just a feeling, its not the love you took
The daytime wasn’t made to hide
And I keep hanging on to the times we set fire – to the night
You won’t believe me, I keep this little life of mine
You couldn’t see me, how do you know what’s left behind?
It’s not that bad, it’s not that kind
You won’t believe me, I keep this little life of mine
You couldn’t see me, how do you know what’s left behind?
It’s not that bad, it’s not that kindYou might also likeEmbed
