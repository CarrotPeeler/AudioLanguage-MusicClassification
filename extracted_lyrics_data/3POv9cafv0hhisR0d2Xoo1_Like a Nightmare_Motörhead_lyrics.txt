7 ContributorsLike a Nightmare Lyrics
I wanna be there
I got to see
I wanna feel it
I wanna watch you looking at me

Oh you know how I feel
When you set me free

Like a nightmare
Like a nightmare, babe
Like a nightmare
Nightmare, oh!


It's an infection
It's a disease
But no reflection
It's gonna make your blood freeze

Oh you know how I feel
When you set me free
You might also like
Like a nightmare
Like a nightmare, babe
Like a nightmare
A night, nightmare, oh!


I can't believe you
You can't be true
But I'll bereave you
I can't explain how good it feels

I know how you feel
I'm gonna set you free

Like a nightmare
Like a nightmare, sugar
Like a nightmare
A night night night night night night...
