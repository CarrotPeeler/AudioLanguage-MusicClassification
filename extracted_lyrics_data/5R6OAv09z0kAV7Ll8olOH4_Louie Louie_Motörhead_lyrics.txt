Louie, Louie, oh baby
We gotta go
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay
Louie, Louie, oh babe
We gotta go

Oh, my little girl
She's waitin' for me
I'd sail a ship, across the sea
On the ship you know I'm all alone
I wonder if I ever make it home

Louie, Louie, oh no
We gotta go
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay
Louie, Louie, oh baby
We gotta go

Three nights and days I sailed the sea
I think of girls, oh constantly
On the ship you know I know I dream that she's there
I smell the roses in her hair
You might also like
Louie, Louie, oh baby
We gotta go
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay
Louie, Louie, oh yeah
We gotta go

Let's give it to 'em! Right now!


I see Jamaica
Who'd have thought?
I don't know when I'm gonna see her love
I know I'll hold her in my arms and then
I tell her that I'll never leave again

Louie, Louie
Et, et, et, et, et, et
Louie, Lou
Oh no
Louie, Louie, oh baby
We gotta go
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!Embed
