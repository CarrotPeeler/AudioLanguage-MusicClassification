3 ContributorsThe Gift Lyrics
You're a shooting star
We're in your constellation
No matter where you are
You know we are waiting
Soon we come for you
While everyone is sleeping
Gonna take you through
The gift is in the giving
Inside of you with all your lies
Nettles and vines
Nettles and vines

Shadows fall on these broken days
If I wait for you
I'm your slave
I'm your slave

I give, I bleed, I try it again
But I could never remember
We fell so hard onto the ground
But we never surrender
We never surrender
We never surrender
We never surrender
You might also like
I know the enemy
I know the one I keep inside
It's a feeling
Help us to survive
See my fingers
See my bones
I walk a thousand miles
On a chemical road
Inside of you with all my lies
Nettles and vines
Nettles and vines

Shadows fall on these broken days
You look so good
As my slave
As my slave

I give, I bleed, I try it again
But I could never remember
We fell so hard onto the ground
But we never surrender
We never surrender
We never surrender
We never surrender
To be born again
There's been so much living
Take it back to the start
You're a shooting star
We are in your constellation
No matter where you are
You know we are waiting
Waiting

I give, I bleed, I try it again
But I could never remember
We fell so hard onto the ground
But we never surrender
We never surrender
We never surrender
We never surrender
I give, I bleed, I try it again
But I could never remember
We fell so hard onto the ground
But we never surrender
We never surrender
We never surrender
We never surrenderEmbed
