1 ContributorBlack Magic LyricsYou got me turning turning, you got me spinning around
You got me turning turning, you got me spinning around
You got me turning turning, you got me spinning around
You got me turning turning, you got me spinning around
You got some kind of black magic, some power unknown
You got control of my senses, got my feet off the ground
You got control of my senses, got my feet off the ground
You got me turning turning, you got me spinning around
No matter where I go, what I do
No matter where I look, my eyes can only see you
No matter where I look, my eyes can only see you
You got me turning turning, you got me spinning around
I'm gonna learn your black magic, wait and see
I'm gonna have you spinning, your eyes will only see me
I'm gonna have you spinning, your eyes will only see me
You got me turning turning, you got me spinning around
You got me turning turning, you got me spinning around
You got me turning turning, you got me spinning around
You got me turning turning, you got me spinning around
You got me turning turning, you got me spinning around
You got me turning turning, you got me spinning around
I'm gonna learn your black magic, wait and see
I'm gonna have you spinning, your eyes will only see me
I'm gonna have you spinning, your eyes will only see me
You got me turning turning, you got me spinning around
You got me turning turning, you got me spinning around
You got me turning turning, you got me spinning around
You got me turning turning, you got me spinning around
You got me turning turning, you got me spinning around
You got me turning turning, you got me spinning aroundYou might also likeEmbed
