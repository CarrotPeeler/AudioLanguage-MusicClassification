3 ContributorsNever Had a Lover LyricsWussup baby?
(But you ain't never had a lover like me)
I know you been to a lot of places
Seen a lot of things, seen a lot of guys
(But you ain't never had a lover like me)
Hey baby, how you doing?
Tell me why won't you smile?
Aww sugar 
Sit down let's talk awhile
She says I ain't been loved in awhile
Been going through ups and downs
And I need somebody
Now I said don't worry about a thing
Baby I got your back
You're rolling with Keith and like that
I know you been through things with some other guys
(But you ain't never had a lover like me)
I know you tired of fearin' how they puttin' it down
(But you ain't never had a lover like me)
Baby bring your body closer to mine
(But you ain't never had a lover like me)
I have your body jump and scream and shout
And say keep doing it all night long
(But you ain't never had a lover like me)
See Keith Sweat LiveGet tickets as low as $75You might also likeI know you been stressin', so I did something special
And darling just for you, we going to Central babe
Baby we'll spend a day hugging and kissing
When I get this feeling, are you going to give me sexual healing?
'Cause I'm feeling you right now, and you know it's been awhile boy
Tell me how you want it, baby girl I'm gonna come jump on it
So let me inside, you ain't never had a lover like me
I know you been through things with some other guys
(But you ain't never had a lover like me)
I know you tired of fearin' how they puttin' it down
(But you ain't never had a lover like me)
I want you to bring your body closer to mine
(But you ain't never had a lover like me)
I have your body jump and scream and shout
And say keep doing it all night long
(But you ain't never had a lover like me)
Your body's here, lookin' sexy my dear
Girl I'm gonna give it to you anyway you want it
There's nothing but chemistry between you and me
Your body is calling me, let me show you the way girl
You should be loved, baby
I know you been through things with some other guys
(But you ain't never had a lover like me)
I know you tired of fearin' how they puttin' it down
(But you ain't never had a lover like me)
Baby bring your body closer to mine
(But you ain't never had a lover like me)
I have your body jump and scream and shout
And say keep doing it all night long
(But you ain't never had a lover like me)
But you ain't never had a lover like meEmbed
