You want to go and see her when you're feeling down
She's a breathtaking spectacle with guaranteed hope
She'll make you feel good, 'cause she's the best thing since soap
She'll greet you in the alley with her fortified smile
She's the original sideshow and she's got her own style
Pardon my baby, she got to have her fun
Yes, I say, pardon my baby, she got to have her fun
'Cause she's a Oklahoma backroom dancer, watch her run
Now, she dances on air just like Superman's child
Like a filter-tip cig'rette she's wild but she's mild
She's more fun than Colorado, and more far-out than Maine
She comes on like thunder and she's more right than rain
She's the mother of earth, and the goddess of thirst
She's the chicken and the egg and whichever came first
Pardon my baby, she got to have a chance
Oh, I say pardon my baby, she got to have a chance
'Cause she's a Oklahoma backroom dancer, watch her dance
Woo
Oh, my
Somebody get the piano player a drink of water

Yeah, I say pardon my baby, she got to have her fun
Yes, she's a Oklahoma backroom dancer, watch her run
Woo
