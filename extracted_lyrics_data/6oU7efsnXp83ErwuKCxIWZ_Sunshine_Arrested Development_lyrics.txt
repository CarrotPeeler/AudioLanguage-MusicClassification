2 ContributorsSunshine LyricsPeople of the world we live in
Don't let no one take our rights
Right to live in peace and righteousness
Science is supposed to work in our favor yaw'l
But when everything naturals destroyed
Put in the place of it is man made decoys
Locking us into a world that ain't no world
Our senses ain't in touch with the universe now
Instead of going so fast into a new age
We ain't even got our present age down pact
We can't keep our own thang in tact
Yet scientists talking bout a computer thang?
It seems to me while some are Scientifically masturbating
The reset of us are scraping to save our lives?
The plan is to reduce us to survival
No mo livin in the sunshine, and I ain't wit that now
In the sunshine
Now ain't nothing wrong with technology
As long as we control where it goes
But as of now it's in the hands of cash flow
And cash ain't humble to Gods plans at all
People whether white, black, red or gold
Need to stand up upright and bold
Need to first rasps our minds and sould
Gotta learn to walk before you run oh
I think most people want the same thangs
Just to smile and live without so much strife
To be in sync with the one God that gave us life
And to have a little time to enjoy thangs
I want all the people to live in the sunshine
The way it was when it was divine
The way it must be in the end cuz...
That's the way it was in the beginning
