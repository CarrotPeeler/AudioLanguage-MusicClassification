1 ContributorBigger Cages, Longer Chains LyricsHold me down 'cause I don't want to wait
I've been blackmailed by myself into this state
Shut it up 'cause I don't want to hear
These old boring ethics must end right here
Come on, give it to me, right now
Hold me down 'cause I don't want to be
Another victim of salvation that's choking me
Set it off 'cause I've had enough
So please, please, please, yeah baby, please shut up
Consider me, consider this
Empty phrases kissing on, on emptiness
Hold me down 'cause I don't want to wait
For some unemployment plan to set it straight
Shut it up 'cause I don't want to hear
About prospects of redemption by the things we fear
Hold me down 'cause I don't want to go
Things are moving backwards, baby or not at all
Set it off 'cause this is killing me
Just waiting for somthing that will set us free for real
Consider me, consider this
Empty phrases kissing on, on emptiness
You see now baby how this fire turns to flames
And I kept hoping that things would change
You might also likeBut now I see that it's up to, it's up to you and me
So, let's get together, get organized
And baby, let's, let's set ourselves free, come on
You see now, baby, how this fire turns to flames
And all they're offering is bigger cages, longer chainsEmbed
