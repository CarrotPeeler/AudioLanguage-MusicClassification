10 ContributorsSo Macho Lyrics
(Ma-m-m-m-ma-ma-ma-macho!)
(Mach-ma-ma-ma-m-m-ma-macho!)

I don't want no seven stone weakling
Or a boy who thinks he's a girl
I'm after a hunk of a guy
An experienced man of the world
There ain't no way that I'll make do
With anything less than I'm used to
If I have a man tonight
He's gotta be right, right, right!

So macho!
He's got to be, so macho!
He's got to be big and strong
Enough to turn me on
He's got to have, big blue eyes!
Be able to, satisfy!
He's got to be big and strong
Enough to turn me on

I'm tired of taking the lead
I want a man who will dominate me
Someone who will love and protect me
And take care of my every need
Now I don't mean to be personal
But a guy like that's more preferable
In my humble point of view
Than any of you!
You might also like
So macho!
He's got to be, so macho!
He's got to be big and strong
Enough to turn me on
He's got to have, big blue eyes!
Be able to, satisfy!
He's got to be big and strong
Enough to turn me on
And on and on and on, oh! (Macho man!)

Ooh, I am in need of a (Macho man!)
Ooh, I am in need of a man
(A man, a man, a man, a man)
He's got to be!

So macho!
So macho!
Big and strong (Big and strong!)
Enough to turn me on
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh! (Macho man!)

So macho!
He's got to be, so macho!
Big and strong (Big and strong!)
Enough to turn me on (Girl, girl, girl!)
He's got to have, big blue eyes!
Be able to, satisfy! (Satisfy me!)
Big and strong (Big and strong)
Enough to turn me onEmbed
