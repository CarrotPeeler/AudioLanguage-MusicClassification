1 ContributorSecret Boy LyricsI hear you call
Cause you feel the same
I hear you laugh
Yes, it's just a game
Everybody wants to know a secret boy
Everybody wants to have a secret girl
Everybody wants to know a secret boy
Everybody wants to have a secret girl
I feel your thoughts
Stranger than mine
I feel your needs
Just a matter of time, yeah
Everybody wants to know a secret boy
Everybody wants to have a secret girl
Everybody wants to know a secret boy
Everybody wants to have a secret girl
I feel your thoughts
Stranger than mine
I feel your needs
Just a matter of time
