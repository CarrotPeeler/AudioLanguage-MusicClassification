1 ContributorDown in the Flood Lyrics
Crash on the levee, mama
Water's going to overflow
And the swamp's going to rise
No boat's going to row
Well you can train on down
To Williams Point
You can bust your feet
You can rock this joint

But oh mama, won't you miss your best friend now?
You're going to have to find yourself
Another best friend, somehow

Now, don't you try and move me, mama
You're just bound to lose
There's a crash on the levee, mama
You've been refused
And it's sugar for sugar
Salt for salt
If you go down in the flood
It's going to be your own fault

But oh mama, won't you miss your best friend now?
You're going to have to find yourself
Another best friend, somehow
You might also like
Well the high tide's rising, mama
Mama, don't you let me down
Pack up your suitcase
Mama, don't you make a sound
Cause it's king for king
Queen for queen
It's going to be the meanest flood
That anybody's seen

But oh mama, won't you miss your best friend now?
You're going to have to find yourself
Another best friend, somehowEmbed
