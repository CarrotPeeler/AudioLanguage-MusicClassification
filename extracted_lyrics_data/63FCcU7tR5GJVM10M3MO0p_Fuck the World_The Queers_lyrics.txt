4 ContributorsFuck the World LyricsI called in sick to work today and stayed in bed 'til noon
And now I just don't care what's going on outside this room
Things aren't getting better
My future's not too bright
Fuck the world, I'm hanging out with you tonight
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-whoa-oh-whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-whoa-oh-whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh

Me and you will walk around so pointlessly
Smashing things, jacked up on way too much caffeine
I'm really going nowhere
I hate this shitty life
Fuck the world, I'm hanging out with you tonight
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-whoa-oh-whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh
