2 ContributorsPick a Side* LyricsLyrics from SLAPS Snippet

Even if you offer Me your burnt offerings and grain offerings, I will not accept them
I will have no regard for your fellowship offerings of fattened cattle
Take away from Me the noise of your songs, I will not listen to the music of your harps
But let justice flow like water, and righteousness like an unfailing stream
Yo, huh, check it, uh-huh, look (Tox)

To my brethren, I'm meritorious (Facts)
It's hard to name anybody else that is doing this (Uh-huh)
They think correct, but mainly for the wrong purpose (Yeah)
Get back on my feet and my grеviances leave a surplus (For rеal)
Leave it at my hands, a professional here at service (Huh? Yeah)
But I gotta ask the God of Hosts truly what His Word is (What is it?)
Yeah, I believe in ghosts (Huh?), like fire in my bones (Yeah)
Demons tryna take control (Yeah, what?), oil tell 'em, "Leave alone"

You been on that ride, fallin' under all the time
Have you made up your mind? Ask you, what's your kinda life?
Said you'd better pick a side 'cause you're runnin' outta time
Only by the Rock will you make it out aliveYou might also likeEmbed
