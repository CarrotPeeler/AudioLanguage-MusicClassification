3 ContributorsI Who Have Nothing Lyrics:
This next song we performed out in San Remo, back in February, it's um, it's a classic song, famous by Shirley Bassey really
So obviously I'd like to try it, 'cos I like a Shirley Bassey song, um, and we did a huge version with Zucchero's daughter
Who is a huge Italian star, and this originally was an Italian song, but most people do know it in English, so um
We've done a slightly different version for you tonight, and this is 'I Who Have Nothing'
I, I who have nothing
I, I who have no-one
Adore you and want you so
I'm just a no-one, with nothing to give you but oh
I love you
He, he buys you diamonds
Bright, sparkling diamonds
But believe me, dear, when I say
That he can give you the world
But he'll never love you the way
I love you
He can take you any place he wants
To fancy clubs and restaurants
But I can only watch you with
My nose pressed up against the window pane
I, I who have nothing
I, I who have no-one
Must watch you, go dancing by
Wrapped in the arms of somebody else
You might also likeWhen darling it's I
Who loves you
I love you
I love you
