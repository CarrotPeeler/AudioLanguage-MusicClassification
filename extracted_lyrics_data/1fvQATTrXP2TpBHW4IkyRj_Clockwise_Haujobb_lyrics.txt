2 ContributorsClockwise LyricsAn ultimate time
Physically natural decay
Cell cosmetic
Just let us stay
Forever
Brainless humanoids
Avoid the automatic switch-off
Safety copies of oneself
With no consciousness
Potential material
Biofunctional design
Artificial but alive somehow
Completely existent
Remake
Post biological age
Do we have to stay in this cage?
