5 ContributorsBack of Your Head LyricsHey
Is it you that makes me hollow?
Don't act the same
Cleaning out a conscience
Scream at the moon
I hear it as it echoes
I'll find out soon
I never want to let go
Hey
Am I picking at your head dear?
Don't you feel shame?
Is it weighing on your conscience?
You fall asleep
In the arms of another man
You're incomplete
Holding out an empty hand
Something in the way you call my name
I'm seeing the difference
Shake it off
Let it exit your system
If time heals all
Then why's there still distance?
Keep those thoughts
In the back of your head

The back of your head
The back of your head
Waiting on me to break apart
And shatter at your name
Swim in delusion, you've reached a conclusion
Convinced that your skin's what I crave
Caught in the moment, no words to be spoken
You're not the apple of my eye
What does it take to keep the things that you say
The furthest thing from my mind?
All you wanted was that feeling
All you wanted was that spark to glow
And never fade away
Something in the way you call my name
I'm seeing the difference
Shake it off
Let it exit your system
If time heals all
Then why's there still distance?
Keep those thoughts
In the back of your head
In the back of your head
In the back of your head
In the back of your head
And all you wanted was that feeling
And all you wanted was that feeling
All you wanted was that feeling
And all you wanted was that feeling
And all you wanted was that feeling
And all you wanted was that feeling1Embed
