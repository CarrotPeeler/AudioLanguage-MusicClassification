She's leavin'
And folks are feelin' so low
They're grievin'
And they're consolin' poor Joe
Gonna miss her song
Gonna miss her smile
She'll be travelin' alone
That last long mile
They're sighin'
With all their trouble and woes
They're cryin' 'cause they all loved
The gal from Joe's (She's the gal from Joe's)

She's leavin'
And folks are feelin' so low (She's the gal from Joe's)
They're grievin'
And they're consolin' poor Joe (She's the gal from Joe's)
Gonna miss her song
Gonna miss her smile
She'll be travelin' long
That last long mile
They're sighin'
With all their trouble and woes
They're cryin' 'cause they all loved
The gal from Joe's (She's the gal from Joe's)
You might also like
They'll miss her so (She's the gal from Joe's)
Everybody's consolin' poor Joe (She's the gal from Joe's)
Gonna miss her smile (She's the gal from Joe's)
She'll be travelin' on a while (She's the gal from Joe's)
They love her so (She's the gal from Joe's)
The gal from Joe's (She's the gal from Joe's)Embed
