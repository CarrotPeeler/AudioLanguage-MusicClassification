1 ContributorQueen of Everything LyricsAnd you / you think you are slowing down the room
Queen for many / they are for you
And I/just don't buy into you
Take your chessboard too

I'm missing what i thought we once had
Just drowning in your memory
I'm the low man down
In your lo-fi town
All for nothing/did you give me a line
Did you say it's okay/did you tell me a lie
Was it easy for you/was it easy to do
Was it misdirection/or misjudging you
You're the queen of everything
And you /you think you are slowing down the room
Queen for many / they are for you

27 thousand /million degrees
And he flew too close/and it burned his wings
But the sun in the head/you have been doing to me
Venus is still hotter than mercury
You're the queen of everything
And you /you think your soul would never bruise
Queen for many / they are for you
You might also like
Low man in your lo-fi town/in your lo-fi town
You're the queen of everything/i'm the king of none
Led me down your garden path/then robbed me with your gun
And you think you're the hottest thing/next to the sun
You're the queen of everything/and i'm the king of none
King of none Embed
