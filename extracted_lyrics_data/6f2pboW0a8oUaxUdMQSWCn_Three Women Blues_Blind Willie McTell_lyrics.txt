2 ContributorsThree Women Blues LyricsGot three womens, yellow, brown and black
I got three womens, yellow, brown and black
It'll take the Governor of Georgia
To judge one of these women I like
One for in the morning, one for late at night
One for in the morning, one for late at night
I got one for noontime
To treat your old daddy right
These blues at midnight, they don't leave me till day
These blues at midnight, they don't leave me till day
I didn't have none of my three women
To drive these blues away
One of them Memphis yellow, the other is a Savannah brown
One of them Memphis yellow, the other Savannah brown
One is a Statesboro dark skin
She'll really turn your damper down
Now if I had listen to what my three women said
Now if I had listen to what my three women said
I'd a-been home sleeping
In a doggone feather bedYou might also likeEmbed
