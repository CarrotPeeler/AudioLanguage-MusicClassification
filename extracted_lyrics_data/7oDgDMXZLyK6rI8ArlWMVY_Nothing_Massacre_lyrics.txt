I've nothing to give
You've taken everything
You didn't leave me shit
Not even worth mentioning
Not even worth a thought
Not worth the pain
Not worth speaking of
I thought that once I meant something
But now I see I'm nothing – nothing
What is this you've done to me
What is it you thrive
Do you enjoy making me
Feel unalive
Not even worth mentioning
Not even worth a thought
Not worth the pain
Not worth speaking of
I thought to you I meant something
But now I see I'm nothing – nothing
You might also likeIt's you I'll always love
I know you don't care
You left me, in despair
Why do I feel this way
Why do I even care
I have no self esteem
There's nothing there
I'm so unimportant
- insignificant –
The way I truly feel
Makes no difference
I wish for once I could be something
But I guess I'll always be your nothingEmbed
