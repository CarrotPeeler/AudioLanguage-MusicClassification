4 ContributorsAmsterdam Says LyricsCars by the water, water that makes this place stand still
Looks like they're thinking, thinking of jumping
I wake to the church bells playing those funky tunes, "Hey Jude"
Up in the tower, carillonneurs thumping

I'm trying to love you but you treat me like a hotel
You're coming and going, but you never say where
I'm trying to love you, but I see your heart is elsewhere
Amsterdam says "Goodnight"
I'm dragging the suitcase through Chinatown, on the Zeedijk
The racket it's making, smell like a tourist
Now this is my home
Though these roots will only ever be so long
It is what it is

I'm trying to love you but you treat me like a hotel
You're coming and going, but you never say when
I'm trying to love you, but I see your heart is elsewhere
Amsterdam says "Goodbye"
I'm trying to love you but you treat me like a hotel
You're coming and going, but you never say when
I'm trying to love you, but I see your heart is elsewhere
Amsterdam says with steel in her voice
"I may seem rude to you but I prefer to hear it straight
And not have to wade through the bullshit between the lines
I know I'm beautiful, and I shouldn't work, but I do
And I can do better than you."You might also likeEmbed
