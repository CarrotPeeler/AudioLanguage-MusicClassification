4 ContributorsWhy Go? LyricsDon't go
I didn't know you'd be here
And I wasn't meant to come
I'd be sitting watching TV
If there was anything decent on
If I'd missed the taxi
Or found nothing good to wear
But for some uncertain reason
Some strange uncertain reason
This is how it all
It all begun
Why go?
Why go?
When you could stay a while?
If I made some coffee
Would you sit and talk some more?
I know words are usually pointless
When you've used them all before
The way your smile fills the room
Stay a while, kick off your shoes
Don't go, please stay
It always happens this way

Fills the room
Stay a while
What's there to lose?
The way you laugh
When I say
"Don't go"
"Please stay"
When you could stay with me tonightEmbed
