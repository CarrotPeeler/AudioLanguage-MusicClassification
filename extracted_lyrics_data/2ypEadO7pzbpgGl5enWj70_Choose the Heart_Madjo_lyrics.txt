One day I’m here
One day I’m not
Feeling our fears
We’ve played with soul
Fragile and stiff
My lips on yours
Let liars wilt
Slippery time

Choose the
Choose the heart
Choose the
Choose the heart

No words to say
Here’s the bed
Here comes denial
Cover one’s eyes
Muscles and nerves
You order
Fever as waves
Rise to fall
You might also like
Choose the (the heart)
Choose the heart (the heart)
Choose the (the heart)
Choose the heart (the heart)

Here I am, disguised
Comes the struggles
Sweet dance inside
Love makes troubles
My mind's drifting
You control
Moon stars come in
Just a fall

Choose the
Choose the heart
Choose the
Choose the heart
Choose the

Oh
There's something out of me, baby
No coming back (choose the heart)
I say to you to stay in
You stop the words burst (choose the heart)
I'm letting time to catch them
It’s breaking down (choose the heart)
The silence
You stay there
The hours partEmbed
