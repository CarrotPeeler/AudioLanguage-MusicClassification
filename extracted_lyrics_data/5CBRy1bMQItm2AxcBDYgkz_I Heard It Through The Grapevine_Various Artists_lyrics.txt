1 ContributorSyllabus Poetics of Struggle Fall 2015 LyricsThe Poetics of Struggle Fall 2014Course Description:
The Poetics of Struggle will engage students creative skills in the production of written and spoken word poetic expressions and performances. The course will explore the intersections of activist, intellectual, and poetic interventions into the discussion of power, struggle, identity, hope, and healing in the post Civil Rights era.  The course will seek to bridge intellectual work with an exploration of individual and communal formations, reformations, and radical imaginations. Using their own lives as sites of exploration, students will be given the resources, teachings, and practice to develop their own tangible and concrete skill sets to understand, engage with, and produce radically imaginative, meaningful modes of knowledge creation and circulation.Course Requirements• Attendance/Participation/Response Pieces/In-Class Writing Assignments (50%)

- And all of your lives and the people, poets, and philosophers we(you) all think are important!!! ParticipationI would imagine the first basis for successful, active, participation is to show up.  We only meet once a week, and only for 10 weeks, which means this first basis is a necessary precursor to our success (and it is indeed our success collectively).  After showing up, participation can take on a number of different forms, and I look forward to exploring the full range of those infinitely imaginable possibilities with each and all of you.  We will have opportunities to share ideas, writing, dreams, hurt, concerns; we will build collective understandings, knowledges, language, and ways of being; and we will also understand that different people (which is of course each of us), “participate” in different ways, and we will create spaces for all of those different ways.  This class will, I imagine, be different from many other courses you may be taking, in that I will be asking as part of your participation, to not only participate as an individual interacting with me or the course material, but with each other, both as each other, and in the creation of a collective community conversation which we will nurture through vulnerability, hope, and healing.  All of which is to say, you will be asked to do things other then just sit in a seat and take notes.  Let’s play!Office HoursYou should come.  Build.  Let’s talk, exchange utterances, share what words are half each other’s anyways.  I am here to provide each and all of you with the most enriching, meaningful, healing, and hope filled experience as possible.  I believe that meeting individually and in small groups can be an important part of this, and I will make myself as available as possible to ensure you have every opportunity to experience our time together as completely or as much as you would like.Academic DishonestyPlagiarizing, cheating, or misrepresenting another’s work as your own will not be tolerated and will result in severe disciplinary action and a failing grade in the course.Disability ServicesThe Disabled Students Program has created a new online system for arranging accommodations for students with disabilities, which you can access from http://my.ucsb.edu. Please ask for accommodations in a timely manner (within 7-10 days of an event, such as a midterm or final). Your needs will be addressed in confidence.
