1 ContributorThe Dream LyricsYou see those faces slowly passing by
Their scary eyes are full of hate
Deep in your heart you feel a creeping pain
It feels like needles in your skin
For you, there's only one way. Is this the point of no return?
When you close your eyes, you realize that your dreams will not come true
You wish you could be someone else, the one who'll take the fear away
And you're waiting for the moment in which you'll see the never ending light
When you're alone you feel the ghosts inside
You hear those voices in your head
You curse the world
And all it's endless lies
When will your sorrow finally end?
Is there a god who can hear our cry?
Is there a god who can rescue our souls?You might also likeEmbed
