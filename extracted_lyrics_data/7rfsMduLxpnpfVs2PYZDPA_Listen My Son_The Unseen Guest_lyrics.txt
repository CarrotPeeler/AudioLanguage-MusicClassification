1 ContributorListen My Son LyricsPut one foot in front of the other
Is all I know
Before you know it you'll be falling down the road
And over at the crossroad they stole the sign
So all you do it walk through a straight line
Chorus:
Listen, Listen, My son, My son
I can't tell you twice what I can't tell you once
They bypassed the route I used to take
But you can't escape the time you now make
So I find myself on the highway on my own
The median's my pathway and my home
Chorus
