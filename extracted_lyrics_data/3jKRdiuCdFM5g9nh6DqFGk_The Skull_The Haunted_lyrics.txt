1 ContributorThe Skull LyricsEasy now, don't give yourself away
Don't let them know you're breaking
These are wolves
And they carry no sympathies
Don't look down
These are but minor details
Hopefully they'll keep you alive
Don't let them see you breaking
Achieve to justify pearls before swine
No more hesitation, no more slipping away
No more waiting for a loving grace
You will crawl, let's not get personal
You will serve an example to others
A skull at the gates to mark who's king
To stare the naked truth into the eyes
And not lose grip on sanity
We learn from falling down
A willingness grows from defeat
To mock the ordinary punk
And see if you still got it in you
You might also likeDid you cry? I wept like a child
In final acceptance to my own mortality
Fuck your pride, it will be your downfall
Easy now, go lightly these are tricky times
We don't need much fuel to feed the fire
No more hesitation, no more slipping away
No more waiting for a loving grace
Easy now, go lightly these are tricky times
We don't need much fuel to feed the fireEmbed
