1 ContributorForgotten LyricsVerse 1: CBeatz
Trying to make it to the top
Looking in the mirror with a case of ciroc
I switched the Scotch for another hop
They just hand me the rock
All my drinks got a blend I'm fucking nutritous
How could I fuck a bitch that slipped without permission
Break my bones forget stitches, I come back you rap bitches
Forget forgiveness, I'm gone till my dad commit to start quittin
Call me gifted, still throw your hands up !
Cause every night is a party and every week is Christmas
In my wishes, I can only talk shit earning riches
These other niggas been hiding man all I hear is some hisses
No more promises, I always break em
I was the most hated they called me the fakest
Well bitch I'm G !
Where the fuck I'm gon go when there's nowhere to flee
And how are my real loves not even in my family
Waiting for the best things in life when none of them free
These bitches blow like they jobs and smoking up trees
I'm on a quest, for my "Destiny like Manifest"
Bulletproof with no vest, words spillin out my chest
It's so cold, lost in a world I barely know
Only 13 but I feel like a 100 fucking years old
I'm just trying to be me not one of the best rappers
Trying to enter the game, but I'm just a trespasser
Trying to rest in peace with no coffin
I'm just another nigga that's been forgotten

And one of my best friends just lost somebody close
I hit em up to tell I'm there so they know
I'm chilling back and breathing all this air
I hate when people say "kk" like they don't even care
I just released that shit "Always There", It was for Keeyse
People fell in love with it, some others just went crazy
I can't make everybody happy, fuck it I'm not god
I'm tryna make a big jump so fuck it I'm Hot Rod
More depressed than usual, more ugly than beautiful
Give me a fucking chance, am I even that usable ?
Tryna be musical, in a box its so cubicle
Putting on this shit but it ain't even that suitable
Stressed the fuck out, still all I hear is laughter
Watch my dreams come true bitch everything's a disaster
Snatching up some snapbacks, looking through my raps
Like, damn I'm fucking good ! , or shit I'm fucking bad
And how could I release a track without feeling like a badass
Went from driving in an Accord, to pulling up in a Hatchback
That's in my dreams now I'm somebody they laugh at
Like should I stop this rap? Or put the pain behind my back
My heart is just decayed, I'm gonna get fucking betrayed
They asking me bout the fame I say I'm fucking afraid
Ballin like Barkley, I'm Gnarls, no looks like Ray Charles
On my way
To be "Sucessful" like Drake and Trey
I hope I never fucking change the way that I been raised
In 8th Grade, but I feel like it's time to graduate
Rise to the top, fall to the bottom
That's when I'll be motherfucking forgottenEmbed
