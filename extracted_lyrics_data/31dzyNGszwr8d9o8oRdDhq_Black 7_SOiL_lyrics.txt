All felt is just fine
Like a rapture waiting
To dine on the divine
It moves across me
And sets me free
Open oh-so gently
Every time I scream release
I mean it
You know it
Every time I feel relief
I feel the dirty black 7
I feel the dirty black 7
Loss of time is felt here
Burning brick in my mind
Like a cancer growing
In the minds of the divine
It moves across me
And sets me free
Open oh-so gently
Every time I scream release
I mean it
You know it
Every time I feel relief
I feel the dirty black 7
Every time I scream release
I mean it
And you know it
Every time I feel relief
I feel the dirty black 7
You might also likeDon't roll me over
Can't help these things I feel
Couldn't see them coming
But I've given into what is real
Extend what's been given
Take a taste of what's within
You cast me over
Yet I've risen and I am real
It moves across me
And sets me free
Open oh-so gently
It moves across me
And sets me free
Every time I scream release
I mean it
You know it
Every time I feel relief
I feel the dirty black 7
Every time I scream release
I mean it
And you know it
Every time I feel relief
I feel the dirty black 7
I am the little cracked mirror
I mean it
You know it
I mean it
You know it
I mean it
You know it
(I feel the dirty black 7)
I am the little cracked mirror
(I am yours)
I feel the dirty black 7
I mean it
You know itEmbed
