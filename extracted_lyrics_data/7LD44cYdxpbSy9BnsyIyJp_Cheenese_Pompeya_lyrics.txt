3 ContributorsCheenese Lyrics
We live like two little angels
Drifting in the skies
Looking for the ways out of dangers
In each other eyes
I'm paranoid about the world i see
It reveals and it bleeds
Monstrous and it sweats
Paranoid
We’re getting too depressed
We're dreaming of escape
Uncertain and unsaved

And it's only you that i need to see
Only here where i need to be
The only air that i need to breath
(We ride the path between the stars)
And it’s only you that i need to see
Only here where i need to be
The only love i want to believe
(We'll find a new life)

We're sharing the power
Of love that never ends
We're growing like
Two little flowers
In each other hands
I'm paranoid about the world i know
This misarable show
We got no way to go
Paranoid
We're getting too depressed
We're dreaming of escape
Uncertain and unsaved
You might also like
And it's only you that i need to see
Only here where i need to be
The only air that i need to breath
(We ride the path between the stars)
And it’s only you that i need to see
Only here where i need to be
The only love i want to believe
(We’ll find a new life)Embed
