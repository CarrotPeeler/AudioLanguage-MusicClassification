6 ContributorsLost in the Girl Lyrics
See the fire burn the fire bright
They say everything worth having’s worth the fight
But I have seen so many birds take flight
And all that does remain here is the night
You got lost in the girl

Lost in the girl
You got lost in the girl
Lost in the girl
You got lost in the girl

Take me to the fête galore
Shimmy less no shimmy more
Bright lights, bright lights
Wave your hands up in the air
Run your fingers through my hair
Bright lights, bright lights

Nothing is forever more
But your body j’adore
Tonight, damn right
You might also like
Lost in the girl
You got lost in the girl
Lost in the girl
You got lost in the girl

And you follow her wherever she goes
One day she goin' love you
It’s all right, baby it’s all right
Yes, you follow her wherever she goes
One day she goin' love you
It’s all right, baby it’s all right

Champagne, caviar
Kiss kiss, au revoir
Bright lights
Bow down baby please
Damn you such a tease
Bright lights

Nothing is forever more
Give me what I came here for
Tonight, damn right
Lost in the girl
You got lost in the girl
Lost in the girl
You got lost in the girl

And you follow her wherever she goes
One day she goin' love you
It’s all right, baby it’s all right
Yes, you follow her wherever she goes
One day she goin' love you
It’s all right, baby it’s all right

Fast life, bright lights
Fast life, bright lights

And you follow her wherever she goes
One day she goin' love you
It’s all right, baby it’s all right
Yes, you follow her wherever she goes
One day she goin' love you
It’s all right, baby it’s all right
Yes, you follow her wherever she goes
One day she goin' love you it’s all right3Embed
