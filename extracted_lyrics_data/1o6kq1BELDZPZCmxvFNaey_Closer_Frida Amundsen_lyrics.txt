1 ContributorCloser LyricsIt's getting late
I'm wide awake
And my mind is raising again
I can't find the words
They all seem wrong
Like the meaning is lost in translation
I have always been in love with you
But
You are unable to see that
I have felt this way, every night and day
Wishing that you would just come
A little closer
Come a little closer
Come a little closer
Closer to me
Come a little closer
Come a little closer
Come closer, closer to me
You must be blind
Believe me I have tried
But nothing I do gets you to see me
How do you feel
I need to know
'Cause my heart just wants to scream it
I have always been in love with you
But
You are unable to see that
I have felt this way, every night and day
Wishing that you would just come
A little closer
Come a little closer
Come a little closer
Closer to me
Come a little closer
Come a little closer
Come closer, closer to me
I have always been in love with you
But
You are unable to see that
I have felt this way, every night and day
Wishing that you would just come
A little closer
Come a little closer
Come a little closer
Closer to me
Come a little closer
Come a little closer
Come closer, closer to meYou might also likeEmbed
