O the rain, the latter rain
Latter rain done fell on me
Latter rain, latter rain, latter rain
O the rain, latter rain
Latter rain done fell on me
Latter rain, latter rain done fell on me

Don't you know the promise is true
It was sent from heaven to you
It was sent to the beloved Son of God

O the rain, the latter rain
Latter rain done fell on me
Latter rain, latter rain, latter rain
O the rain, the latter rain
Latter rain done fell on me
Latter rain, latter rain done fell on me

O the rain, the latter rain
Latter rain done fell on me
Latter rain, latter rain, latter rain
O the rain, latter rain
Latter rain done fell on me
Latter rain, latter rain done fell on meYou might also likeEmbed
