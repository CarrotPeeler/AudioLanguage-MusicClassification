City life, callin' me all the time
Me and my soul, geared to attack
Never get another chance, so what you doin'?
Gotta get money, can't quite do it

Can't stand your loneliness
Can't stand your loneliness
Can't stand your loneliness
Can't stand your loneliness

Shit night life, be tryin' not to laugh though
You won't get money from doin' what you lovin'
I'm movin' out of city, victor of a second chance
Get a lot of problems, we kicked a lot of them

Can't stand your loneliness
Can't stand your loneliness
Can't stand your loneliness
Can't stand your loneliness

Can't stand your loneliness
Can't stand your loneliness
Can't stand your loneliness
Can't stand your loneliness
Can't stand your loneliness
Can't stand your loneliness
Can't stand your loneliness
Can't stand your loneliness, no, not the loneliness6Embed
