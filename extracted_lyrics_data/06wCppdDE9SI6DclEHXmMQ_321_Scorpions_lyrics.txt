3 Contributors321 Lyrics
Time is a wicked master
Put your life into its hand
Close your eyes and it will crush you
Fate only spins you faster
It's a curse born unto man
Turns your dreams into disaster

Save me because the world's going to stop
And baby, 3, 2, 1, are you ready to rock?
Come on and wake me, the final curtain will drop
And baby, 3, 2, 1
Are you ready to rock?
Are you ready to rock?
Are you ready to rock?
Are you ready to rock tonight?

Lies, it's the truth I'm after
Let me find it in your eyes
Quick before the moment dies
Cries in a sea of laughter
Weeping gently in my soul
Love's the only thing that matters

Save me because the world's going to stop
And baby, 3, 2, 1, are you ready to rock?
Come on and wake me, the final curtain will drop
And baby, 3, 2, 1
Are you ready to rock?
Are you ready to rock?
Are you ready to rock?
Are you ready to rock?
Are you ready to rock?
Are you ready to rock?
Are you ready to rock?
Are you ready to rock tonight?

(10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4) 3, 2, 1!

Come on and save me 'cause the world's gonna stop
And baby, 3, 2, 1, are you ready to rock?
Come on and wake me, the final curtain will drop
And baby, 3, 2, 1, are you ready to rock?

Come on and shake me 'cause we're in for a shock
And baby, 3, 2, 1, we're fallin' down from the top
Come on and take me, we're goin straight to the top
And baby, 3, 2, 1
Are you ready to rock?
Are you ready to rock?
Are you ready to rock?
Are you ready to rock?
Are you ready to rock?
Are you ready to rock?
Are you ready to rock?
Are you ready to rock tonight?1Embed
