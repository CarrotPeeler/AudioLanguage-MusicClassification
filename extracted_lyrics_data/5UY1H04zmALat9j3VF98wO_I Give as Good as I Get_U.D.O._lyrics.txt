6 ContributorsI Give As Good As I Get Lyrics
Don’t wanna read between the lines
I know what’s good, I know what’s fine
I know what makes me feel just right
Don’t wanna have an endless fight

And I know – what’s right
I know what’s right
And I know – what’s wrong
I know what’s wrong
I give as good as I get
I give as good as I get

I know what time to lay my head
I know the answers best unsaid
And no decree can make me see
Another way of being me

And I know – what’s right
I know what’s right
And I know – what’s wrong
I know what’s wrong
You might also likeI give as good as I get
I give as good as I get
I give as good as I get
I give as good as I get

I know the way to cross a street
I even know to trick or treat
I know what’s right – I know what’s wrong
You better listen or you’re done

I know there’s no one same as me
I am unique – I’ve got to be
This is the way – I am for real
The only way for me to feel

And I know – what’s right
And I know – what’s wrong
I give as good as I get
I give as good as I get
I give as good as I get
I give as good as I get
I give as good as I get
I give as good as I getEmbed
