13 ContributorsLet Me Go Lyrics
Once there was a day
We were together all the way
An endless path unbroken
But now there is a time
A torture less sublime
Our souls are locked and frozen

Once we were years ahead, but now those thoughts are dead
Let me go (Let me go)
All hopeless fantasies are making fools of me
Let me go
I walk alone and yet never say goodbye
Let me go (Let me go)
Change of heart, a change of mind
And heaven fell that night
Let me go

I tried, but could not bring
The best of everything
Too breathless then to wonder
I died a thousand times
Found guilty of no crime
Now everything is thunder

(Daytime) All I want is
(Nighttime) I don't need the
(Daytime) All I want is
(Nighttime) I don't need the
(Daytime) All I want is
(Nighttime) I don't need the
(Daytime) All I want is
(Nighttime) I don't need the
Got to, got to, got to, got to let me go

Ba-duh-da-duh-da, duh-da-da-da
Ba-duh-da-duh-da, duh-da-da-da
Ba-duh-da-duh-da, duh-da-da-da
Ba-duh-da-duh-da, duh-da-da-da
Ba-duh-da-duh-da, duh-da-da-da
Ba-duh-da-duh-da, duh-da-da-da

Once we were years ahead, but now those thoughts are dead
Let me go (Let me go)
All hopeless fantasies are making fools of me
Let me go
I walk alone and yet never say goodbye
Let me go (Let me go)
Change of heart, a change of mind
And heaven fell that night
Let me go
The best years of our lives
The hope of it survives
The facts of life unspoken
The only game in town
I'll turn the last card down
And now the bank is broken, broken

Found guilty of no crime (Broken)
They were the best years of our lives (Broken)
(Let me go, broken)
I'll turn the last card downEmbed
