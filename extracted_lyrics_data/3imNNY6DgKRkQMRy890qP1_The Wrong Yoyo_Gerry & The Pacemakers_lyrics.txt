No need to hang it baby by my door
I used to love you but I can't no more
You got the right string baby but the wrong yo yo

No need to hang it baby by my door
I used to love you but I can't no more
You got the right string baby but the wrong yo yo
The right string baby but the wrong yo yo
No need to hang it baby by my door
I used to love you but I can't no more
You got the right string baby but the wrong yo yo
The right string baby but the wrong yo yo
No need to hang it baby by my door
I used to love you but I can't no more
