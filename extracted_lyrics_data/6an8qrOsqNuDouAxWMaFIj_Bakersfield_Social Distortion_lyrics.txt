Take me down that line, gonna tow that heavy load
I can't seem to make it, make it on my own
Turn your lights down low now, turn down our bed
I can't seem to get you out of my head

Stranded here in Bakersfield
So close, yet so far, far away
Stranded here in Bakersfield
You’re a million miles away, yeah, yeah

I feel the heat coming down now, sweat runs down my face
I can hardly fake it, girl, fake it through this day
Was it something that I said or something I didn’t do?
Eighteen more hours, girl, 'til I’m home to you

Stranded here in Bakersfield
So close, yet so far, far away
Stranded here in Bakersfield
You’re a million miles away, yeah, yeah

So I walked out that lonely truck stop with my head hanging down
Wondering how in the hell I got myself into this mess
And more importantly, how I was gonna get myself out of it
So I wrote a song for you, baby girl
And I hope when I return home
The locks ain’t changed on the doors
And there’s still a spot for me
On that big old California king-sized bed

Stranded here in Bakersfield
So close yet, so far, far away
Stranded here in Bakersfield
You’re a million miles away, yeah, yeah

Won’t you come see me in Bakersfield?
I’m not a million miles awayEmbed
