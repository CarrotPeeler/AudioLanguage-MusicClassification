26 ContributorsIt Should Be Easy Lyrics
I've been thinking, just sitting thinking
On why I love you and all the reasons
And if I lost you, boy, if I lost you
I'd lose myself, and I wouldn't feel the way I feel now
You bring me zen, yes, you bring me zen
And you make me feel like a million billion
I'll let you in, but don't you break my heart
Don't you rip me apart, oh, don't you rip me apart

Baby love, it should be easy
It shouldn't be complicated
It should be easy
I don't know how else to say it, say it, say it, say it

I don't know how to say it

I've got visions, boy, I've got visions
Of me and you happily just livin'
I know they're out there, them beautiful men
But you my future, baby, you my right now
If there was a scale from one to ten
My love for you is a million billion
Boy, I'll love you 'til the day I'm dead
So please don't mess with my head, please don't mess with my head
You might also like
Baby love, it should be easy
It shouldn't be complicated
It should be easy
I don't know how else to say it, say it, say it, say it

I don't know how to say it

La-di-dee, la-di-da
It's the only way you love
La-di-dee, la-di-da
It's the only way you love
(I don't know how)

Baby love, it should be easy
It shouldn't be complicated
It should be easy
I don't know how else to say it

La-di-dee, la-di-da
It's the only way you love
La-di-dee, la-di-da
I don't know how to say it4Embed
