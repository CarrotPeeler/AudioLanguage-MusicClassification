1 ContributorBlack Lodge (Black Strings mix) Lyrics
Worship the ground you barely walk on
You give of yourself, but your angels are gone
Deny your body is screamin'
But your heart and your soul - they're bleedin'
Just to fall asleep is a godsend
Until your demons appear again

I am a witness to your demise

Your biggest secret is one you can't keep
Lift up your head if you're only asleep
You try to hold on to reason
Why can't you see that you're leavin'?
My love for you knows no distance
But it can't fight your resistance

I am a witness to your demise
I am the one who saw through the lies

Give me the one thing you can't give
Take me to the Black Lodge where you live
Give me the one thing you can't give
Take me to the Black Lodge where you live

Deny your body is screamin'
But your heart and your soul - they're bleedin'
Just to fall asleep is a godsend
Until your demons appear again

I am a witness to your demise
I am the one who saw through the lies
My love has always been blind

Give me the one thing you can't give
Take me to the Black Lodge where you live
Give me the one thing you can't give
Take me to the Black Lodge where you live

Where you live
Where you live
Where you live
Where you liveEmbed
