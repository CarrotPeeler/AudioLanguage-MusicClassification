2 ContributorsCaught My Eye LyricsSo nice to see you again
What a lucky coincidence
You're the angel who looked and smiled
As we waited in the checkout line
Very nice to meet ya
Girl I like your features
Maybe soon I could treat ya
To somewhere quiet no people
Or maybe get to know ya
Over a chi or a mocha
Anything's alright
Saw you standing in line
Baby you caught my eye
Baby you caught my eye
Caught my eye
Baby you caught my eye
Caught my eye
Now that you're standing here
Yeah yeah
Wanna tell you just how I feel
So I'll shake off these butterflies
Yeah
Just can't leave this chance behind
Ohhhh no no no
