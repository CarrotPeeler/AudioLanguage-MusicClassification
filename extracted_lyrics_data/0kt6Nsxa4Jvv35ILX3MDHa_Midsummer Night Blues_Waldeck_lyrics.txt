You read my mind
No one between us
Just sunshine
Away
Away
It felt so good
It felt so right
Somehow inbetween
A summer's night
Away
A mystic cloud
The moon above
Your eyes in mine
How did you find
Away
Away
Away
The search is gone
It's all so strong
When we were made
Somebody would disagree
Away

You read my mind
No one between us
Just sunshine
Away
It felt so good
It felt so right
Somehow inbetween
A summer's nightEmbed
