The name of the song is "Bad Luck City"
Lord, a lotta people don't know about that
'Cause they have never been there
But I've been there, and I know
Lotta times you love them women
And they don't love you
But I have one, and I love the one I have
That's why I tell her every morning, when I wake up
I sit down and tell her these words

Cause I love you, baby
Cause I love you, baby
Love you, promise, my old girl
Love you, promise, my old girl

Them women, you know
Lotta times you have them women, they love you too
They'll say the same thing back to you, you said to them

No, I ain't gonna leave you, baby
No, I ain't gonna leave you, baby
Love you, too, baby
Love you, too, baby
You might also like
But if there's trouble, problems
When you love them women and they don't love you
Lotta times, I wanted to leave her a lotta times
I been through that problem
But they be so nice to you, you just set down and tell 'em

No, I ain't gonna leave you, baby
No, I ain't gonna leave you, baby
Love you, too, baby
Love your , girl

Yeah, but it's trouble, I tell you
When you love them women and they don't love you
You love them, and they tell you one morning
"I got to leave you"
I tell her these words, one more time

Don't leave me, baby
Don't leave me, baby
Don't leave me crying, girl
Don't leave me crying, girl
Lotta times she feels sorry, y'know?
Say the same things back to me I said to her
I be done started back in the house to close the door
She'll tell me the same words

No, I ain't gonna leave you, baby
No, I ain't gonna leave you, baby
Love you, too, baby
Love you, too, baby

By that time we got everything settled then
Goin' try to move on
But it's a problem-
But it's a problem-
But it's a problem-
When you love them women and they don't love you

I know a lotta people don't know about Bad Luck City
'Cause they've never been there
But I been there
And I know about it
Cause I love you, baby
Cause I love you, baby
Love you for myself, girl
Love you for myself, girlEmbed
