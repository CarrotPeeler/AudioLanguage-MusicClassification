2 ContributorsAll I Ask For Lyrics
'Cause all that I ask for is turning to ashes
When everything comes down

There's nothing to die for
There's nothing to die for

'Cause I'm burying my sins
I'm a prisoner in waiting
I'm drowning within
When the world is all I'm hating
This is my hell

We conform from underground
We arise from your defenses
Through this constitution, revolution end
'Cause all that I ask for is turning to ashes
When all of my passion crumbles around me
I'm stripping the guilt of all that surrounds me
When everything comes down
There's nothing to die for

If I cannot be saved
Then my pride is for the taking
If this is my grave
I will close my eyes awaking
Everything's red
You might also like
We conform from underground
We arise from your defenses
Through this constitution, revolution end
'Cause all that I ask for is turning to ashes
When all of my passion crumbles around me
I'm stripping the guilt of all that surrounds me
When everything comes down
'Cause all that I ask for is turning to ashes
When all of my passion crumbles around me
I'm stripping the guilt of all that surrounds me
When everything comes down
There's nothing to die for

Pero mi país
Todo por mi país
Todo por mi país
Todo por mi país

'Cause all that I ask for is turning to ashes
When all of my passion crumbles around me
I'm stripping the guilt of all that surrounds me
When everything comes down
There's nothing to die for
(There's nothing to die for)
(There's nothing to die for)
There's nothing to die for
(There's nothing to die for)
When everything comes down
'Cause all that I ask for is turning to ashes
When all of my passion crumbles around me
I'm stripping the guilt of all that surrounds me
When everything comes down
There's nothing to die forEmbed
