4 ContributorsSouthern Can Is Mine Lyrics
Now looka here mama let me tell you this
If you wants to get crooked I'm gonna give you my fist
You might read from Revelations back to Genesee
But if you get crooked, your southern can belongs to me
Ain't no need you bringin no jive to me
Cause your southern can is mine

Might go uptown have me arrested and have me put in jail
Some hotshot got money come and throw my bail
Soon as I get out, hit the ground
Your southern can worth two dollar, half a pound
Ain't no need of bringing no stuff to me
Cause your southern can is mine

You might take it from the south you might carry it up north
But understand you can't rule or either be my boss
Take it from the east, hide it in the west
When I get it mama, your can won't see no rest
Ain't no need of bringing no stuff to me
Cause your southern can is mine
(in the morning)
Your southern can belongs to me
(i'm not dreamin)
Your southern can belongs to me
You might also like
Ah ashes to ashes mama, and sin to sin
Every time I hit you you'll think I've got a dozen hands
Give you a punch through that barb-wire fence
Every time I hit you you'll say I've got no sense
Ain't no need of bringing no stuff to me
Beause your southern can is mine
(Every bit of it)
Southern can belongs to me

Get me a brick out of my backyard
Give you the devil if you act kinda hard
Ain't no need of bringing no jive here honey
Cause your southern can is mine
(You hear me cryin)
Your Southern can belongs to me
Spank it a little bit, boy
(Guitar run)
Ah, your southern can is mine

Now if I catch ya mama down in the heart of town
Take me a bran-new brick and tear your can on down
Ain't no need you bringin no stuff to me
Because your southern can belongs to me
(I'm talkin to ya)
Your southern can belongs to me
You may be deathbed sick and mama and graveyard bound
I'll make your can moan like a hound
Ain't no need you bringin no stuff to me
Because your southern can is mine
(You hear me talkin)
Southern can belongs to me
(Guitar run)
Oh spank it like that
The way Ruthie Mae like it
Cause your southern can is mine

Sit there unsteady with your eyes all red
What I said get your grandma dead
Ain't no need of bringing no jive to me
Cause your southern can is mine

Oh you got to stop your barkin and raising the deuce
I'll grab you mama and turn every way but loose
Ain't no need of bringing no jive here honey
Cause your southern can belongs to me
(Every bit of it)
Southern can belongs to me
(Guitar run)
Aww, whup it boy, that's the way the people like that thing

Ain't no need of bringing no jive here honey
Cause your southern can is mine
(You hear me talkin)
Your southern can belongs to me

You might twiddle like a tadpole
Let it jump like a frog
Every time I hit it you'll holler
God oh God
Ain't no need of bringing no jive here honey
Cause your southern can is mine
(You hear me talkin)
Southern can belongs to me
Now play it a little bit, just whup it
Aww shucks. Play that thing boy
Southern can belo-ongs to meEmbed
