6 ContributorsSome Get Back (Revenge) Lyrics
Revenge!
Revenge!
Revenge!
I need some, get back, I'm mad! You're gonna bleed bad!

Snap the joints in your arm
Stabbing arteries make your neck leak
Five point palm exploding heart technique
Merciless like Paul Kersey, thirsty for retribution, .38 bursting
A desire burning like gasoline fire
Yearning to murder like Omar from Wire
No negotiation, you won't know it's coming
No association, incrimination
Just tribulation, break in your crib brought
Reciprocation, aluminums to your fibula
Pull the trigger biblically
Bring it to your siblings, equipped to be vindictive
Carrying a shotgun, wearing a scary costume
I'll get at you like Harry Osbourne
Scope you, peepin' you, surveillance
Bring back balance, valiant like young Vallon
From Gangs of New York seeking revenge for his fathers death, Dead Rabbits rep
Hit you with hollow tips, like a giallo flick
Side-step the laws and legal politics
Rockin disguises, doctors' outfits
Glock cocked at your knot, you shit in your trousers
Crucify ya gruesome like Medusa
Do you believe in Jesus? I'll introduce ya!

Revenge!
I need some, get back, I'm mad! You'll end up dead for that!
Revenge!
I need some, get back, I'm mad! You're gonna bleed bad!
Revenge!
I need some, get back, I'm mad! You'll end up dead for that!
Revenge!
I need some, get back, I'm mad! You're gonna bleed bad!

Hit 'em hard, hit 'em fast, like Chopper said
Pop you in the head, drop you, then bop ahead
Walk away, camouflaged by the night
Like I'm a guard, snipe you with your entourage
The mission is to be in a position, to strike
Cold, calculated, and efficient
Carefully, meticulous financially you'll wish
You never cost me to begin with, bitch!
You better jet
You're facing a real predator
With a Beretta, with a vendetta like Perrette
Never forget, like an elephant
Dwell upon the fact you'll get your melon split
Some Makaveli shit, I relish it
You're disabled, and delicate, unable to flip
Crush you completely, you can't beat me
Rush you, treat you worse than feces!
Revenge!
I need some, get back, I'm mad! You'll end up dead for that!
Revenge!
I need some, get back, I'm mad! You're gonna bleed bad!
Revenge!
I need some, get back, I'm mad! You'll end up dead for that!
Revenge!
I need some, get back, I'm mad! You're gonna bleed bad!
