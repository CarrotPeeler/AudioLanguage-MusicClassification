Who are them two niggas that are changin' the game? (Daz and Kurupt)
Fuckin' it up, usin' our name up in vain (something Kurupt)
So whatcha wanna do, let's ride, bang
Up on these other-sided niggas... and ride on the game (There they go!)
I retaliate, in the alley way, on a sunny day (Here we go!)
Blast up on niggas for they tally way, let 'em on they way
Boo-ya-ka, boo-ya-ka, you should've looked before you come out
Boo-ya-ka, boo-ya-ka, you should've looked before you run out (Nigga!)

Who them niggas that are squabblin'?, blast (Kurupt and Daz)
Quick to knock niggas square on they ass (You betta ask)
Yeah them gangsta niggas back wit the smash, so quick, so fast
Drinkin' straight gin outta the glass (Not if that ass)

Look at this shit, I can't believe was goin' down right now
Got a hand, I'm tuckin' 'bout to blast off a couple of rounds
I show you gangsta niggas, T to a T-B, controllin' all of the monopoly

It's D.P.G mothafucka ain't nothin' really changed
...I come through the block and let my system bang
Let the 15 shoves and let the back hang
Smoke out all my fuckin' window like a choo-choo train (Smoke it, smoke it)
Indo what smokin' nigga be like some do-do rang (Gangstaville nigga)
Ahh Yeah! nigga you set some game
