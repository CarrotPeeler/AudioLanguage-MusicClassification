She blew my mind behind the record machine
She was a shitload of trouble called the Subway Queen
Had a hip with bad habits and a shake that was a bit obscene
One night I caught her runnin' out the cellar door
There was about a million people lyin' flat on the floor
For such a sweet little lady, I would swear she's rotten to the core
Ha ha, oh yes

She got her hands in the cookie jar
Smilin' like an alligator
Makin' headlines in the back of the car
Tight-lipped now but sink ships later

Well, I know a thing or two about a
(Sweet little sister)
Her mama kill her if she knew what she do she's my
(Sweet little sister)
She'll love ya black and blue
(Sweet little sister)
She's Mona Lisa with a new tattoo
She's my sweet little
Sweet little sister
You might also like
Say, every quittin' time is another disease
Too many cowboys ridin' high, shootin' low at the knees
The back hand boogie is the price you pay for bein' the squeeze
The petting's getting heavy, got my tongue in her ear
Her friend is doin' time for kicking ass on a queer
They're in a mental state and all their friends are here
Oh yes

She's tellin' lies through her burgundy lips
An angel on a mission of mercy
She'll get you dancin' with the crack of her whip
She'll take you up to Heaven on her rocket ship

I know a thing or two about a
(Sweet little sister)
Her mama kill her if she knew what she do, she's my
(Sweet little sister)
She'll love ya black and blue
(Sweet little sister)
She's Mona Lisa with a new tattoo
She's so sweet, uh, sweet as candy

She got her hands in the cookie jar
Smilin' like an alligator
Makin' headlines in the back of the car
Tight-lipped now but sink ships later

Well, I know a thing or two about a
(Sweet little sister)
Her mama kill her if she knew what she do she's my
(Sweet little sister)
She'll love ya black and blue
(Sweet little sister)
She's Mona Lisa with a new tattoo
She's my sweet little
Sweet little sister

Oh yeah, yeah, yeah-yeahEmbed
