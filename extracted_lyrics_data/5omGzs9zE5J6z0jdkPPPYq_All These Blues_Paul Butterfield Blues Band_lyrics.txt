1 ContributorAll These Blues Lyrics
When you have these blues
And there's someone you're 'bout to lose
There'll be a time
Yeah, you can't sleep at night
She would believe in you, oh, if you would treat her right

I say, everyday, when the sun is almost down
You remember when your baby left this town
Some people were born to lose
That's why lovers have the blues

I say, everyday, about five you'll hang your head and cry
That is the time when your baby said goodbye
And you wanted to put your traveling shoes on
Yeah, you feel like crying when you get these kind of blues
Yeah, all these blues
I said all these blues nowYou might also likeEmbed
