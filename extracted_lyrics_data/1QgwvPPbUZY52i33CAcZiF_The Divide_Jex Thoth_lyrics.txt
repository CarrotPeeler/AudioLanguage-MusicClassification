2 ContributorsThe Divide LyricsHarvesting the stillness
Sharpening the silence
Cutting to the distance
Will they know us when we come
Strong and reckless
Wrong and fearless
Do they hear us
Will the know us when we come
Wrong, detangled
Divide
Roar, detangled
Divide
Softening the sharpness
Far beyond the distance
Steady in the stillness
Will they be ready when we come
Roar, the hammer
Decide
Roar, the hammer
