1 ContributorWhat Do You Do LyricsWhat do you do, What do you do

People want to know where I go, how I think
Then they ask me when I'm going to do it
They're always asking questions butting deep into my life
They want to know what I do every minute

They say "what do you do?" well what's it to you?
How do you do? I'm fine thank you
What do you do? Well I do what I do
And that's what I will do
What do you do - Same as you do
What do you do - Same as you do, same as you do
What do you do - Same as you do
What do you do - Same as you do

They say you look just like a whore in a church
You know I think I'm gonna stay away from you, you, you
And that's what we will do

They say "what do you do?" well what's it to you?
How do you do? I'm fine thank you
What do you do? Well I do what I do
And that's what I will do
You might also likeWhat do you do - Same as you do
What do you do - Same as you do, same as you do
What do you do - Same as you do
What do you do - Same as you do

Check this out
I could be walking with two chicks under my arms
And here is this carload of big fat balding guys driving by
And they're still calling me a faggot

They say "what do you do?" well what's it to you?
How do you do? I'm fine thank you
What do you do? Man I just mind my own business
So why don't you kiss my ass?
What do you do - Same as you do
What do you do - Same as you do, same as you do
What do you do - Same as you do
What do you do - Same as you doEmbed
