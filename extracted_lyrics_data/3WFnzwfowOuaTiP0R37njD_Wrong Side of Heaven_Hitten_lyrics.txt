1 ContributorWrong Side of Heaven LyricsWhat is this place?
What am I doing here?
Some people come in every day
They're dressed in white
Like angels from the sky and
Sometimes they take me for a walk
Once again that machine
Plugged in my head
What I thought to be angels
Are now demons
They try to damage my brain
With electric shocks
I'm trapped here
Wrong side of heaven
That's the place where I am now
Wrong side of heaven
Tortures and punishment every day
Wrong side of heaven
I don't know why I'm here
Wrong side of heaven
I can't remember anything from behind
Wrong side of heaven
Wrong side of heaven
You might also likePeople around me
Say they remember
The night they arrived to this place
They were beaten
And tied with a rope
I guess that is what they did with me
We are now, part of their game, oh no!
We are patients
Who test their experiments
They keep us locked up in this cage
Prisoners 'till death
Wrong side of heaven
That's the place where I am now
Wrong side of heaven
Tortures and punishment every day
Wrong side of heaven
I don't know why I'm here
Wrong side of heaven
I can't remember anything from behind
Wrong side of heaven
Wrong side of heaven
Once again that machine
Plugged in my head
What I thought to be angels
Are now demons
They try to damage my brain
With electric shocks
I'm trapped here
Wrong side of heaven
That's the place where I am now
Wrong side of heaven
Tortures and punishment every day
Wrong side of heaven
I don't know why I'm here
Wrong side of heaven
I can't remember anything from behind
Wrong side of heaven
Wrong side of heavenEmbed
