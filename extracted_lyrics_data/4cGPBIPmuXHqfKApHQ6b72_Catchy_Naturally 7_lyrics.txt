1 ContributorCatchy Lyrics
Breathe (breathe)
In (in)
Out (ha ha)

Tell me if you really catchin' this
You’ll be in the zone if you start to catch my drift
It's almost like the rider heard ya
The look ?
It's catchy full of patterns like that rug from Persia

It ain’t like catchin' a bull
It's more like catchin' a cold
Like catchin' a cab
Instead of taking a stroll
Are you catchin' the show?
Are you catchin' the groove?
It's like the more that you know
The more that you move
Say yes, if you think that it’s catchy enough
Say yes, if you think that you’ve fallen in love
Say yes, universal from the church to the club
Say yes, say yes
You might also like
Is it catchy? Yeah
Are you caught already?
I'll let you catch me
I’m-a move while the camera steady
Is it catchy? If you ask me
I'm-a let you know
Catch you setting up shop on your radio

(Now let 'em breathe) Breathe, in, out, ha ha
(You wanna breathe) Breathe, in, out, ha ha
(You wanna breathe) Breathe, in, out, ha ha
(So let 'em breathe) Ha ha ha, ha ha ha

I just wanna make you catch the run
I gotta beat you straight so if it’s a catch ?
Now you gotta know I'm playing goals, he's against those ?
'Cause you can't fit the spirit when you got to go
It's like catching the world
It ain't like catching a plain
Like you already ?
It's more like catchin' a plain
It's like catchin' a fever
You now a believe
You don't want it to stop
And I don't want it to neither
Say yes, if you think that it's catchy enough
Say yes, if you think that you've fallen in love
Say yes, universal from the church to the club
Say yes, say yes
Is it catchy? Yeah
Are you caught already?
I'll let you catch me
I'm-a move while the camera steady
Is it catchy? If you ask me
I'm-a let you know
Catch you setting up shop on your radio

(Now let 'em breathe) Breathe, in, out, ha ha
(You wanna breathe) Breathe, in, out, ha ha
(You wanna breathe) Breathe, in, out, ha ha
(So let 'em breathe) Ha ha ha, ha ha ha

Catch me if you can
That's a catchy little phrase, and it's part of the plan
If you do, you don't
And if you don't, you do
Catch on! (That's the catch)
It's a catch 22
Catch your breathe  (ahh)

It's like catching a wave
You can shoot it like a rocket
You can catch it full of stars
And put it in your pocket
Like the catchet in the ride
Don't get caught in the light
Did you catch that?
Catchy like a nursery rhyme
Say yes, if you think that it's catchy enough
Say yes, if you think that you've fallen in love
Say yes, universal from the church to the club
Say yes, say yes
Is it catchy? Yeah
Are you caught already?
I'll let you catch me
I'm-a move while the camera steady
Is it catchy? If you ask me
I'm-a let you know
Catch you setting up shop on your radio

(Now let 'em) Breathe, in, out, ha ha
(You wanna) Breathe, in, out, ha ha
(You wanna) Breathe, in, out, ha ha
(So let 'em breathe) Ha ha ha, ha ha ha
(Let 'em breathe) Ha ha ha, ha ha ha
(Breathe) Ha ha ha, ha ha ha
Breathe (breathe)
In (in)
Out (ha ha)Embed
