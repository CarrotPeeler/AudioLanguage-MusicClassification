2 ContributorsBlack Cat Blues LyricsI had a dream last night
God knows a black cat had crossed my trail
I had a dream last night
God knows a black cat had crossed my trail
You know I don't want you to
Sweep me with no broom
'Cause I'm afraid I might go to jail
When my right hand itch
People, you know I'm gettin' money for sure
You know when my right hand itch
People, I'm gettin' money for sure
You know when my
Left eye get to jumpin'
Somebody's just got to go
I went home last night
I lay down 'cross my bed
I woke up this mornin' God knows
Broken, hungry too, I said, oh
Lord, this black cat have crossed my dream
You know sometime I wonder B.G
What in the world's gonna happen to me
You might also likeWell, I went down to the cemetery
Got down on my bended knees
I asked the good Lord above
To take this spell off of me and I said, 'Woah'
You know a black cat have crossed my dream
You know I begin to wonder B.G
What in the world is gonna happen to meEmbed
