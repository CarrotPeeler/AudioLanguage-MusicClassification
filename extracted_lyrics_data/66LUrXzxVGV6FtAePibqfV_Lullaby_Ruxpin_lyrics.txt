1 Contributor18th Century Lullaby Lyrics
Don't be scared
It’ll be just fine
When we finally find a way
Out of the mazes in my mind

Sugar in the wind blowin'
18th Century Lullaby
Everybody sees you comin'
Just another reason to die

Don’t be scared
No one can hurt you in here
Although the distance is far
I know we'll make it in time

Sugar in the wind blowin'
18th Century Lullaby
Runnin' from the fake lovin'
Just another reason to dieYou might also likeEmbed
