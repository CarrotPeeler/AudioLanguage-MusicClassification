1 ContributorClimbing Towards Stars LyricsTake a walk
Take the last step
Towards the end
On the backbone of night
These might be the last steps we set
As we climb to the stars (to the stars)
As we climb to the stars
Towards the end
A depressive earth
With a depressive shape
They will tear holes into the ground
Then we will watch the world burn down (the world burn down)
The world burn down
It seems today
Has come for me
Please god
Come save me
Take a walk
Take a step forward
And don't look back
As the world burns in silence
No one's there to challenge

As we climb to the stars
It seems today
Has come for me
Please god
Come save me
Take a walk
Take a step forward
And don't look back
As the world burns in silence
No one's there to challenge
As we climb towards the stars
Take a walk
Take the last step
Towards the end
On the backbone of night
These might be the last steps we set
As we climb to the stars (to the stars)
As we climb towards the end
It seems today
Has come for me
Please god
Come save me
It seems today
Has come for me
Please god
Come save meEmbed
