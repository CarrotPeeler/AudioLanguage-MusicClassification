The girl next door said that your walks go too long
Oh, oh, air, oh, oh, air
While she was singing her favourite song
Oh, oh, air, oh, oh, air
Her smile hid behind the camera lens
Oh, oh, air, oh, oh, air
He tried not to laugh, but he chuckled like a hen
Oh, oh, air, oh, oh, air

And that love that we fatally made
And the doves that took it away
And the love that you said it can't stay
It went away

Our city of battle trees is curled up to sleep
We spent all of our money buying roses for the king
Oh, oh, air, oh, oh, air
And the shade may be breaking through your window
Oh, oh, air, oh, oh, air
Don't look for the answer, it's the question you don't know
Oh, oh, air, oh, oh, air

And that love that we fatally made
And the doves that took it away
And the love that you said it can't stay
It went away
You might also like
And that love that we fatally made
And the doves that took it away
And the love that you said it can't stay
It went away
It went away

It's the question you don't know
It's the question you don't know
It's the question you don't know2Embed
