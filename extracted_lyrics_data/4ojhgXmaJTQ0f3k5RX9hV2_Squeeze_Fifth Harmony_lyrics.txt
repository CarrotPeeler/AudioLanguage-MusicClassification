End of the night, looking at me, what do you see?
Wish I could read your mind
Dimming the light, here in the dark, going by feel
Only the moon to guide

When we're alone, I get so close
Give me your warmth I've never known
Face to face, caught in a wild embrace
This is the safest place I've ever known

Put your arms around me, baby
Put your arms around me, baby
And squeeze
Only you know how to save me
Put your arms around me, baby
And squeeze, squeeze

(Ooh)

Remember the night, talking to me, saying the words
I wanna hear the most
Gave me your heart, gave me your coat when I was cold
Taking me sweet and slow
You might also like
When we're alone, I get so close
Give me your warmth I've never known
Face to face, caught in a wild embrace
This is the safest place I've ever known

Put your arms around me, baby
Put your arms around me, baby
And squeeze
Only you know how to save me
Put your arms around me, baby
And squeeze, squeeze

(Ooh)

Put your arms around me, baby
Put your arms around me, baby
And squeeze
Only you know how to save me
Put your arms around me, baby (Baby)
And squeeze, squeeze

(Ooh)
(Ooh)
Would you squeeze me, hold me, baby?13Embed
