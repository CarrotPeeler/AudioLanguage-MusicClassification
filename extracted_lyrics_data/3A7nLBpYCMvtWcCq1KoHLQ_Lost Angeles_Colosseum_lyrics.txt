2 ContributorsLost Angeles LyricsThe truth that I bring and the words that I sing are all meant for you
Trees, they are full, the minds, they are bare and this time I care
Everyone has a car but they won't travel far
Well nobody here has the sunshine that I still have
Sad sad town, sad sad town in the buzzing desert
Shanty town, shanty town, shanty town of the millionaire
A man will awaken one morning, alone on the tall brown grass
A millionaire alone in the burning desert
Sad sad town, sad sad town in the buzzing desert
Shanty town, shanty town, shanty town of the millionaire
A man will awaken one morning, alone on the tall brown grass
There's a millionaire alone in the burning desert
Here am I alone in this city
Ain't that a pity
I just want to leave
And get away from Lost Angeles
Earthquakes and smog
Are driving me out of town
I don't want to be here
I don't want to be around
Take me away if you please
I do not want to live in Lost Angeles
I don't want to live here
Just want to get back home
I don't want to be here any more
I want to be on my own
Take me away if you please
Get me away from Lost AngelesYou might also likeEmbed
