Well, come on, baby do you wanna go, get down
Back to that live on line city, 
Sweet home Chicago
One and one is two, baby you know it
Two and two is four
I'll be back tomorrow night
Mama come  through the front door
Singing come on, baby do you wanna go

Back to that live on line city
Sweet home Chicago
Two and two is four
Four and two is six
I'll be back tomorrow night baby
You know I'ma gettin' my li'l business fixed, singin'
Come on, baby do you wanna go?
Come on, come on, come on
Baby do you wanna go?
