2 ContributorsDreamer LyricsSeasons, my friend
Color me so we can blend
Forbid me to go
I know so little about the wind when it blows
Dreamer, dreamer
I'm walking out of your dream
Take me off that parade
And place me somewhere
In your sense of a shades
Your night shuts my door
And I will not dream anymore
See if I can pass by that waiting hand
If I can pass by that wandering man
If I can leave to get on
See that it all makes sense pretty soon
Dreamer, dreamer
I'm walking out, while you go on
Dreamer, dreamer
I'll be where I belong
Dreamer, dreamer
Dreamer, dreamer
I'm walking out, while you go on
Dreamer, dreamer
But dreamers don't come along
Dreamer, dreamer
I'll be where I belong
Dreamer, dreamer
Stop me if I'm wrong
