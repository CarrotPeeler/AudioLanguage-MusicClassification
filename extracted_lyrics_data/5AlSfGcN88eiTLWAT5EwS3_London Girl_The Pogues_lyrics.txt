3 ContributorsLondon Girl Lyrics
A devil moon took me through the alley
Down by the Kardomah and the Centrale
To the mews running through the backstreets
Where the blacks sell fire and sleep

The devil moon took me out of Soho
Up to Camden where the cold north winds blow
Sucked along by a winter shower
To stand beside your shining tower

This could be our final dance
This could be our very last chance
The sound of your voice, wherever I may be
Changes everything and then the world's alright with me

You're my London girl, the way that you walk
You're my London girl, the way that you talk
You're my London girl, just the sound of your voice
I ain't got no choice

The lights were going out, the moon was dying
The night was turning to a fine spring morning
The dogs were barking and the kids were shouting
The sun was splashing in a crystal fountain
You might also like
When the cold winds come and find you
Blowing down from the top of the high rise
I'll come and take you back down to Soho
Away from all those mad men's eyes

This could be our final dance
This could be our very last chance
And if you cut me, don't you think I'll feel?
Is this body clay, is this heart made of steel?

You're my London girl, the way that you walk
You're my London girl, the way that you talk
You're my London girl, just the sound of your voice
I ain't got no choice

This could be our very last chance
This could be our final dance
And if you cut me, don't you think I'll feel?
Is this body clay, is this heart made of steel?

You're my London girl, the way that you walk
You're my London girl, the way that you talk
You're my London girl, take the rest of the world
You're my London girl
You're my London girl, you're my London girl
You're my London girl, you're my London girl
You're my London girl, you're my London girl
You're my London girl, you're my London girl
You're my London girl, you're my London girlEmbed
