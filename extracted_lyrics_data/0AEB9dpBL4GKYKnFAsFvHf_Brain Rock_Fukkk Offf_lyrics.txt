1 Contributor“0 To 100 GreenEnk Mix” Lyrics

Mad enough to poke holes in leather seats
Smokin quotes exhaling heat
Excelling at levels they'll never reach
Killedchildren of women that's bigger freaks than you'll ever meet
If ya street cred get settled for cheap
However brief, I murder a pack & let it breathe
Surgical slash reverent priest
Word to the last left in the breed
I'll turn to the bat you ever need
That, certain assassin expertise
The curtain retracts, I set the scene
Run tell that Cornell cat reppin the East
You might also likeIs back to wet his beak
And half steppers get clapped sweating the lead
Fast as the jag sped from police
0 to 100 and that's just on the beat
My raps is a mattress strapped with 100 racks and tippin sheesh
Bout to slip and bleed
Make niggas think they went to see the exorcism 3
Are you kidding me?



Load & lock the 40 for these cocky shorties
Thinkin they big shots like robert horry, knock it off B
She ride the Pony Horse jockey homie
Catchin da balls like a soccer goalie
Steamin broccoli plottin for da chicken teryaki homie
While these lame niggas still plottin on me
Drinkin Mango Margeritas with the mamacitas
Who know we all about our money like parkin meters
So when did you realize that nothing on the movie screens translates to these real lives
See How Sincere I've Kept It in Recollection
Do You see Everything you wanted to become in ya reflection?
If so its a blessin
Wondering what you see in me why you believe in me why our wavelengths travel the same frequency
The Vibrant Colors Of You Become Dull Grey As The Comfort Sets in & Your Mystery Fades. Something New is On the Horizon Again
Something new on da horizon again no one to blame
Man its so much on the scatterbrain i can explain
What the fuck happened concerned with cash & change
Came Off da Best Block
Shit on niggas like da Rest Stop
On demand out da Red Box
Feeling Like a Million Bucks with Da Fresh Socks
Tame The Disrespect Ahk
Or Pay a Visit to da Next Doc
Brain Trauma Off da Headshot
Still Official on da Refs watch
Get Money Nigga Eff Cops
I Promise we Gon Get Up & she Stays Down
Muthafuckin Class Act Modern Day Blade Brown
I just chopped da Braids & cut the Fade Down
These Young Hoes Yell da Name Proud. I think im in da Game Now
89 til infinity they'll remember me
& reminisce da G as they hit the weed sips of hennessy
Tell the homies keep it real for life & keep flossin
Be the number one stunna baby like Steve Austin
Tell da Kids to pick up the educationals
Hit the parks play ball do somethin recreational
Avoid the cages they say was handmade for you
Gotta keep ya head up & find a way to make it thru
Its no unity so if the teams scattered
Then the schemes dont add up & da dreams shattered & no thing matters
Thanks for makin Me handsome Lord
& to be blessed with game to lift skirts in these grandmama's
Vintage larry Johnsons or David Robinsons
Maybe iverson or da Mocassins
Dont Try to Imitate Emulate Wannabe Mock us Kid
I was In tech handling Tools an art Major in da Smock & shit
You niggas some candy ass Jabronis Like da Rock Suggests
Having Cents in Common is an oxymoron like common Sense
I stay thinkin in my wonderment i constantly wander in
I have ideas alot but i constantly sqaunder them
Good intentions but being mischievious with da squad & shit
I pick da flyest garments for my ancestors dat cotton picked
Fuck it im chillin imm just talkin shit
Me & yall niggas is opposites
I'm built off Remy Martin & False Confidence
Fake Bitches with Broken hearts & broken promises
Keep my head above water im losin oxygen
Fuckk it.. I'm chillin I'm just talkin shitEmbed
