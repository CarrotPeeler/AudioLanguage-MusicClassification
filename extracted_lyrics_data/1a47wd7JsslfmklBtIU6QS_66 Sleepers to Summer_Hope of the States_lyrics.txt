1 Contributor66 Sleepers To Summer LyricsBlind men saw
What no one ever saw before
Someone with nothing
Standing on the edge of the earth
All roads lead to somewhere else
I know I lost my way
Don't make me a leader
I'll lead you all wrong
Let me just sing sad songs
To right all their wrongs
There ain't a change coming soon
I couldn't even save us
No saviour am I
They sold us out for nothing
There's something to say
It's getting worse every day
Empty hearts
And winter riot hopeless blues
Ideas for falling:
Why don't you just hold on?
Don't make me a leader
I'll lead you all wrong
Let me just sing sad songs
To right all their wrongs
There ain't a change coming soon
I couldn't even save us
No saviour am I
They sold us out for nothing
There's something to say
It's getting worse every day
You might also likeI couldn't even save us
No saviour am I
They sold us out for nothing
There's something to say
It's getting worse every day
I know I'm lying
But I can't let you down anymore
I'm not the one to lead you allEmbed
