9 ContributorsWrong Victory Lyrics
Rose colored glasses
They couldn't shield anything
Golden flames that burn
But couldn't heal me from within
Disperse the heat
Let the cold sweep in, oh
Burst in languid light
As my head and body spin

When your skin doesn't feel like home, oh
And I don't wanna break down and feel alone, oh oh oh
This body only knows, oh
How to hold back more than it shows, oh oh oh

A superstition
That found itself in the way
Of a freed premonition
That could have helped me escape
It's the wrong kind of victory
Disguised as a breakthrough
It's hard when nothing
Fits like it used to
You might also like
When your skin doesn't feel like home, oh
And I don't wanna break down and feel alone, oh oh oh
This body only knows, oh
How to hold back more than it shows, oh oh oh

Hairs on my hand, stand on end
The spine of this truth, repel and suspend
Act like bars, but should help me transcend
Hairs on my hand, stand on end
The spine of this truth, like cracks in the wind
Act like bars, but should help me transcend

When your skin doesn't feel like home, oh
And I don't wanna break down and feel alone, oh oh oh
This body only knows, oh
How to hold back more than it shows, oh oh oh2Embed
