2 ContributorsEye to Eye Lyrics
All I want is reciprocation
Don't care where you spend your nights
There's no need for that conversation
As long as we see eye to eye
Tangled up in your hesitation
Thrown off by the space you keep
I'm all for a little recreation
So get out of the back of my mind

Doesn't matter how thick I build it
You break through when I turn around
And I'm left to deal with the absence
Can't help but be conscious of now
Can't tell you I'm a weaker rival
Shouldn't let my secret out
I'll just hang on to your arrival
Isolate my love from my doubt

Do you know what I'm always thinking?
Which way would it sway your mind?
I don't think that I want an answer
It's enough to be let inside
Do you know what I'm always thinking?
Which way would it sway your mind?
I don't think that I want an answer
It's enough to be let inside
You might also like
All I want is reciprocation
Don't care where you spend your nights
There's no need for that conversation
As long as we see eye to eye
Tangled up in your hesitation
Thrown off by the space you keep
I'm all for a little recreation
So get out of the back of my mind

Do you know what I'm always thinking?
Which way would it sway your mind?
I don't think that I want an answer
It's enough to be let inside
Do you know what I'm always thinking?
Which way would it sway your mind?
I don't think that I want an answer
It's enough to be let inside
Ooohhhhhhh..
Ooohhhhhhh..
Ooohhhhhhh..
Oooohhhhhh..
Oooohhhhhh..Embed
