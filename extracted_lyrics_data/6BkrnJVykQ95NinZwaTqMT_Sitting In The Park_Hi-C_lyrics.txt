11 ContributorsSitting in the Park Lyrics
At the tone, the time will be
8:59 and 10 seconds

Nine o'clock in the morning, yes, I got dressed
Thought about my girl with the big fat breasts
So I called her up and asked could I see her today
She said, "Okay," so I said, "I'll see ya, Shante"
Hung up the phone, then I threw on my clothes
I pulled some tissue off the roll to blow the boogers out my nose
Put on my chain and my boots and things
'Bout to step out the house and heard the telephone ring
I grabbed the telephone just to see what was up
She said, "Gimme the place and time and we could hook up"
I said, "Okay then, why don't you meet me in the park?
At a quarter to five, 'cause at six, it get dark"
She said she didn't mind, okay it's on
So I grabbed my Skanless jacket, then I hung up the phone
I stepped out the house, smilin' and grinnin'
Sayin' to myself, "Hot damn, I'm winnin'"

Oh what shall I, what shall I, what shall I do
Sittin' in the park, waitin' for you
Oh what shall I, what shall I, what shall I do
Shall I slap the trick and tell the tramp it's through?
I'm sittin' in the park waiting for you
You might also like
On the way to the park I had to stop at the store
When bums beg me for a quarter I usually say no
But that day I made all they but holler
Went in my pocket, gave the poor fellas a dollar
They couldn't believe it, they had to ask me, "What's wrong?"
I said, "Yo, just take this dollar and get your butt on"
I bailed five or six blocks with a skip and a hop
Mmh, what's that smell? Oh, the flower shop
Now I pulled a lotta girlies out they pantyhose
And never, never have I ever bought a chick no rose
But that day, I had to be the Life Saver
To top it all off, I rushed to 31 Flavors
The girl said she loved me, she said I was cute
But all I thought about was just knockin' her boots
I thought about doing it with no hesitation
Now I'm sittin' in the park just waitin'

Oh what shall I, what shall I, what shall I do
Sittin' in the park, waitin' for you
Oh what shall I, what shall I, what shall I do
Shall I slap the trick and tell the tramp it's through?
I'm sittin' in the park waiting for you

Now I'm sittin' on a bench with my back against the fence
Hi-C's not dumb, I got a gang of sense
Flowers in my hand, ice cream in a cup
I'm thinkin' to myself, "Won't this girl hurry up?"
I seen my homies comin' and my butt puckered up
They said, "There go the homie Crawf, hey Hi-C, what's up?"
I grabbed the roses, tried to hide 'em behind my back
But I was stuck in a—ouch—caught in the act
Then a old man walked up to me
He said, "You know, whatever will be, will be"
I said, "Excuse me sir, I don't mean to be rude"
Knowin' good and damn well I'm in a bad mood
He said, "Look like you got yourself a few problems
Why me, being a old man, maybe I can solve 'em"
"Pops, that sound familiar, what shall I do?"
"Well, just slap that trick and tell the tramp it's through"
Sittin' in the park waiting for youEmbed
