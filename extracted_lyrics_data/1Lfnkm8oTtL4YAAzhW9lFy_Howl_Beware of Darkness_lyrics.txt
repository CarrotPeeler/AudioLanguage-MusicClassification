You think you’re right, I think you can change
Draw some blood, I’m not going hungry tonight
Won't it be fun, to howl in the night?
Howl so that the angels can hear you
Yeah
Catch me if you can
My, my, my
I’m a hungry man
Oh, oh
Catch me when I fall
Baby girl I want to hear you howl
Cut strings, you think too much
I can't wait this long for a rush
A misery to be alone
How'd you want to be the lonely one?
Howl so that the angels can hear you
Oh child when will you see the light
C'mon make up your mind I've been here all night
Tick tock I know we can make it by dawn
So let's run away to heaven and never be foundYou might also likeEmbed
