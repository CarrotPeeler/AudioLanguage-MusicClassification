22 ContributorsGoodnight Lyrics
First place on a classroom wall
Every turn of the face can help to break
The fall from a domestic disgrace
Every rumour displaced, is lost and found

A lack of discipline, one hand to cut the other
So unprofessional, you're not a friend, you're just a lover
Nothing exceptional, this is correctional

Mirror on the wall, frame the picture
Reflect this kiss to wish us all goodnight

First day in a victim's chair
Every surface replaced can help to keep you
Fair for a corrected gaze
Every feature displayed will match your crowd

A loss of innocence, one hand to wash the other
Be a perfectionist, you're nothing if you're just another
Something material, this isn't personal

Mirror on the wall, frame the picture
Reflect this kiss to wish us all goodnight

We're all dancing to the same sad song
And we're not sleeping, but it won't take long
Illicit conviction, confessions incomplete
Correction, submissive restriction
Instructions will repeat, direction

Mirror on the wall, frame the picture
Reflect this kiss, to wish us all goodnightEmbed
