1 ContributorHeart of Gold LyricsYou think I'm a whore
But I got a heart of gold
You're lockin' your doors
You're leavin' me out in the cold
Well, I've been bought and baby
I've been sold and I
Need protection from the cold
You may think that my humanity
Has been the cause of all this insanity
This whole damn world's got so much uncertainty
I sure wish you'd see something in me
You think I'm a whore
But I got a heart of gold
You're lockin' your doors
You're leavin' me out in the cold
Well, I've been bought and baby
I've been sold and I
Need protection from the cold
You may think that my humanity
Has been the cause of all this insanity
The whole damn world's got so much uncertainty
I sure wish you'd see something in me
You might also likeYou think I'm a whore
But I got a heart of gold
You're lockin' your doors
You're leavin' me out in the cold
Well, I've been bought and baby
I've been sold and I
Need protection from the cold
I need protection from the cold
Yes, and I need protection from the cold
I need protection from the coldEmbed
