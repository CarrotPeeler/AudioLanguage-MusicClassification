1 ContributorFuture History LyricsClass, please open your books on chapter 3
About a period in time not that unique
The best intentions unveiled by history
The past has been written, let's try to read
Will you remember?
How we loved to play keep-away
Girls and gays were seen as a different race
Considering other races animals
Treating animals as bad as beasts
Will you remember?
That we forgot to put things in perspective
Future history, a past yet to come
Will you remember?
Progress was not us moving ahead
It only meant the rest was moving back
Having more future in front than past behind
What harms us most now never came to mindYou might also likeEmbed
