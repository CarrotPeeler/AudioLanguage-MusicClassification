1 ContributorHigher Ground LyricsPeople keep on learnin'
Soldiers keep on warrin'
World keep on turnin'
Cause it won't be too long
Powers keep on lyin'
While your people keep on dyin'
World keep on turnin'
Cause it won't be too long
I'm so darn glad he let me try it again
Cause my last time on earth I lived a whole world of sin
I'm so glad that I know more than I knew then
Gonna keep on tryin'
Till I reach my highest ground
Teachers keep on teachin'
Preachers keep on preachin'
World keep on turnin'
Cause it won't be too long
Oh no
Prayers keep on prayin'
Believers keep on believin'
Sleepers just stop sleepin'
Cause it won't be too long
Oh no

Cause my last time on earth I lived a whole world of sin
I'm so glad that I know more than I knew then
Gonna keep on tryin'
Till I reach my highest ground...Whew!
Till I reach my highest ground
No one's gonna bring me down
Till I reach my highest ground
Don't let nobody bring you down
Till I reach my highest ground
God is gonna show you higher ground
He's the only friend you have around
