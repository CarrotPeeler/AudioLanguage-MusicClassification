Now, now I'm gonna show you
Now, now I'm gonna show you how the West Coast smash kids
Now, now I'm gonna show
Now I'm, now I'm gonna show you how the
Now I'm gonna show you
Now, now I'm gonna show you how the West Coast smash kids
Yeah, uh, something classic
Now I'm gonna show you how the West Coast smash kids

That's the game in a word, play the game and get served
Leaving you laying on the curb, mumbling your last words
Catch birds and serve 'em, catch birds and serve 'em
Catch the words I'm slangin' like the birds I'm bangin'
You ever heard of a gangster? Ever heard of him bangin'?
Catch a G on CD, you turn it up and you crank it
That's the way that you thank him, for the work on the bang
You even thank the producer, and remembеr his name
I'm on my way to the future with somе juice and some drank
And some loosies and dank to set the mood for the bang
I play it cool with the bang, my shit hit like a wave
When you surfin' the ocean, locin' in front of babes
Still the boat when it float, feel the coast that I boast
Feel the steel that I peel, if you get up too close
We about to get us the coast
We got the boats all ready, we got the Coast all ready
Now it's just time to boast
Uh, now it's just time to boast
We got the Coast all ready, now it's, yo
You might also like
Now I'm gonna show you how the West Coast smash kids
Something classic (Now I'm gonna show you how the)

Pull a gun, dumb nigga, ya dumb, you get hung where I'm from
The Wild West, nigga, I'm Johnson's son
The wrong one to awake, I stay awoke to this day
The most devoted poet broke ya right over ya face
With a vase, Exile with a crate full of records
Wreck the stage right after we get paid for the effort
Eff the place up, the bass bump something triumph
Try 'em, Friday came and I had to fry 'em
Friar Tuck with the iron, tucked for the fire bust
Like I'm miced up, psych bitch, I'm never wired up
'Less I'm wired up off of that fire, fired up
Cutting rappers like red wires, expire your luck
This is blue blood, truer than love, doing my thug
Thizz, I put it up with the twist, for the dub
It's the win-win city, not to be confused with the Windy City
Where some of my blood still runs
Uh, some of my blood still runs
Yeah, some of my blood

Now I'm gonna show you how the
Now I'm gonna show you how the West Coast smash kids

Leave it up to F Dot, to show you how the West rock
Show you how the sket pop, we not the ones to test, ock
12s rattle the pavement, can feel it from the next block
Rob you for your Rolex watch, while Blu and Ex watch, only in Cali
Where we make a riot out a rally, make a scraper out a Caddy
Make a runner out your momma, make a dealer out your daddy
Some live in the lower bottoms, some niggas be living lav-y
Head to Venice, get a baddy with a fatty, send the addy
The left coast is bigger than California
Never traveling to Portland, never heard of Tacoma
And amazing marijuana, dispensaries every corner
The shit I smoke is the loudest, could wake you up out a coma
Ayy, with me, B&E stay
Gon' tell you, that bitch DJ, this shit deserves a replay
We run it like a relay, sometimes it feels like there's no escape
You know the place, meet the real warriors of the Golden State

Yeah (That's me, Blu, Exile)
Now I'm gonna show you how the West Coast smash kids
Something classic, uh (Know what I'm sayin?)
Now I'm gonna show you how the
Now I'm gonna show you how the West Coast smash kids
Now I'm gon', now I'm gonna, now I'm gonna
Now I’m gonna, now, now I’m gon, now I’m
Now, now I'm gonna show you how the West Coast smash kids
Now I’m gonna show you how the
Yeah, something classic, uh, in the making
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, something classicEmbed
