2 ContributorsLiquid Arms Lyrics
We are paired like two limbs
Not perfect, not in sync
I reach out into nothing
My voice evaporates
And leaves me, but I don't care
'Cause I know you're speechless too

The effect has taken on
Our senses all shut off
I surrender to liquid arms
In the ether, answers found

And I don't wanna leave
Or lose this peace
And I know who we are
And where we belong

I don't wanna leave this peace
I don't wanna leave this peace
I don't wanna leave this peace
I don't wanna leave this peace
Please don't wake upYou might also likeEmbed
