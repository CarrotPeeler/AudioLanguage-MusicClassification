16 Contributors1989 Lyrics
Goodbye, 1989
I wanna be the one in control
Rock my white shoes, bolo tie
The next big thing for five years running

It's not your turn
It's not your turn yet!

Back off, you little shits
Gnawing at my bits
I see they breed you by the boatload
Back off, you little whores
Get 'em on all fours
And let me beat you to the fucking punch

My body's not even cold!
My act is just getting old

Goodbye, 1989
I wanna be the one in control
Rock my white shoes, bolo tie
The next big thing for five years running
You might also like
It's not your turn
It's not your turn yet!

Back off, you little shits
Gnawing at my bits
I see they breed you by the boatload
Back off, you little whores
Get 'em on all fours
And let me beat you to the fucking punch

My body's not even cold!
My act is just getting o-o-o-old

Some babies wanna get down like this
We eat what we like
Oh, oh, oh, oooh!
Some babies wanna get down like this
We eat what we like

Back off, you little shits
Gnawing at my bits
I see they breed you by the boatload
Back off, you little whores
Get 'em on all fours
And let me beat you to the fucking punch
My body's not even cold!
My act is just getting old1Embed
