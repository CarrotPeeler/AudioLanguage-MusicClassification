3 ContributorsO Come, O Come Emmanuel Lyrics
O come, O come, Emmanuel
And ransom captive Israel
That mourns in lonely exile here
Until the son of God appear

Rejoice, rejoice, Emmanuel
Shall come to thee, O Israel

O come, thou rod of Jesse, free
Thine own from Satan's tyranny
From depths of Hell thy people save
And give them victory o'er the grave

Rejoice, rejoice, Emmanuel
Shall come to thee, O Israel

O come, O come, thou Lord of might
Who to thy tribes on Sinai's height
In ancient times did'st give the law
In cloud and majesty and awe
You might also like
Rejoice, rejoice, Emmanuel
Shall come to thee, O Israel
