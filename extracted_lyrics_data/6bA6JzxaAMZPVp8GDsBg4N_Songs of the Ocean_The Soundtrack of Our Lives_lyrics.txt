2 ContributorsSongs Of The Ocean LyricsHere we are floating again
Writing the songs of the ocean
Wondering who will be singing in your ear
Here we are floating again
Riding the sea of devotion
Wondering who will be with you while you're here
When we don't belong anymore
No we don't belong anymore
To the umbilical shore
Here we are floating again
Writing the songs of the ocean
Waiting to fill all the tracks of your tears
Here we are floating again
Breaking the waves of emotion
Hoping to make the ascension when it's clear
That we don't belong anymore
No we don't belong anymore
To the umbilical shoreYou might also likeEmbed
