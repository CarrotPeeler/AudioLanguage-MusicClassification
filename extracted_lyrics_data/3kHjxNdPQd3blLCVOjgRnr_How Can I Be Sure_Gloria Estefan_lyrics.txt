2 ContributorsHow Can I Be Sure LyricsHow can I be sure in a world tha's constantly changing?
How can I be sure? Where I stand with you?
Whenever I, whenever I'm away from you
I wanna die 'cause you know I wanna stay with you
How do I know maybe you're trying to use me
Flying too high can confuse me
Touch me, but don't take me down
Whenever I, whenever I'm away from you
My alibi is telling people I don't care for you
Maybe I'm just hanging around with my head up upside down
It's a pity I can't seem to find
Someone who's as pretty and lovely as you
How can be sure?
I really, really, really want to know
I really, really, really want to know
How's the weather
Whether or not we're together
Together we'll see it much better
I love you, I love you forever
You know where I can be found
How can I be sure in a world that's constantly changing?
How can I be sure?
I'll be sure with youYou might also likeEmbed
