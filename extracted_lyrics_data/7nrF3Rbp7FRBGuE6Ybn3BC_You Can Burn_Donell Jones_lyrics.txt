1 ContributorYou Can Burn Lyrics
I usually don't do this
But I gotta introduce y'all to Breese
Ah ah yeah, ah ah let's get it
Ah ah yeah, ah, yeah
Ah ah yeah, ah, yeah
It's Candyman Music, baby
Yo Breese, go get 'em
(You know I'm ready to rock this, let's go)

Baby, what you want, things ain't the same no more
I done closed the door 'cause I don't want you
Had your turn, lesson learned
Left me hurt, now it's your turn
You can burn
You can pack your stuff 'cause you know I caught you
But you won't leave with much, I'm gonna keep what I bought you
'Cause you had your turn, lesson learned
Left me hurt, now it's your turn
You can burn
Baby, check-check it, hit the curb 'cause it's over

Boy, I'm finished, gotta end this, I'm in control
Ain't no comin' back, baby, there goes the door
Had your turn, lesson learned
Left me hurt, now it's your turn
You can burn
You might also like
Man, it feels so good to see that you're lonely
'Cause I was faithful, baby, you were the only
'Cause you had your turn, lesson learned
Left me hurt, now it's your turn
You can burn
You done caught the vapors, baby, nothing can save ya
Acting like you did nothing wrong here's your walking papers
'Cause you had your turn, lesson learned
Left me hurt, now it's your turn
You can burn
Baby, check-check it, hit the curb

Boy, I'm finished, gotta end this, I'm in control
Ain't no comin' back, baby, there goes the door
Had your turn, lesson learned
Left me hurt, now it's your turn
You can burn, oh, hey

You're burning up, you're burning up, you're burning up
You played the game and you lost
You're burning up, you're burning up, you're burning up
Left me cold so I won't cool you off
Had your turn, lesson learned
Left me hurt, now it's your turn
You can burn, oh, hey
You can't have this love
Because you didn't know how to treat it right
Need a guy that I can trust
Keep it moving 'cause it's over
Said I'm giving up
Don't need a little boy, need a man in my life
This is a new beginning but for you this is where it ends

Boy, I'm finished, gotta end this, I'm in control
Ain't no comin' back baby there goes the door
Had your turn, lesson learned
Left me hurt, now it's your turn
You can burn, oh, hey
Boy I'm finished gotta end this I'm in control
Ain't no comin' back baby there goes the door
Had your turn, lesson learned
Left me hurt, now it's your turn
You can burn, oh, heyEmbed
