I told you how you hurt me, baby
But you don't care
Now, I'm cryin' and deserted, baby
But you don't care
Ain't nobody tell me this is love
When you're immune to all my pain
I need you to tell me this is love
You don't care? Well, that's okay

Well, I care (Ooh)
I know you don't care too much (Ooh)
But I still care (La-la-la-la-la)
Baby (La-la-la-la-la-la)
Oh, I care (Ooh)
I know you don't care too much (Ooh)
But I still care (La-la-la-la-la)
Baby (La-la-la-la-la-la), ow

Ever since you knew your power
You made me cry
And now, everytime our love goes sour
You won't sympathize
You see these tears fallin' down to my ears
I swear you like when I'm in pain, yeah
I try to tell you all my fears, huh
You still don't care? That's okay, hey
You might also like
Well, I care (Ooh)
I know you don't care too much (Ooh)
But I still care (La-la-la-la-la)
Baby (La-la-la-la-la-la)
Oh, I care (Ooh)
I know you don't care too much (Ooh)
But I still care (La-la-la-la-la, yeah)
Baby (La-la-la-la-la-la, yeah), ow

Boy, maybe if you cared enough (Maybe if you cared enough)
I wouldn't have to care so much (Wouldn't have to care so much)
What happened to our trust? (Happened to our trust?)
Now you're just givin' up (Now you're just givin' up)
You used to be so in love (You used to be so in love)
Now, you don't care no more

Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, oh, woah, woo, ooh

Well, I care (Ooh)
I know you don't care too much (Ooh)
But I still care (La-la-la-la-la)
Baby (La-la-la-la-la-la)
Oh, I care (Ooh)
I know you don't care too much (Ooh)
But I still care (La-la-la-la-la-la-la)
Baby (La-la-la-la-la-la)
I still care (La-la-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la-la)
I still care (La-la-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la-la)
I still care (La-la-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la-la)
Ow (La-la-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la-la)
I still care (La-la-la-la-la-la-la)17Embed
