1 ContributorGuns and the Young Lyrics
Police have no suspects yet
Both women have been shot twice in the head
Gang violence in Boston
No parent has planned that their children would leave them on this earth through violence
Arrrgghhh
Hey, what's the big idea? Why don't you look where you're
Police are on full alert

.357 Magnum, 9 millimeter handgun
AK-47 and an Uzi submachine gun
.357 Magnum, 9 millimeter handgun
AK-47 and an Uzi submachine gun
.357 Magnum, 9 millimeter handgun
AK-47 and an Uzi submachine gun
.357 Magnum, 9 millimeter handgun
AK-47 and an Uzi submachine gun

You see it on TV, you know it looks cool
All these actors going around, killin' thousands of people
In two or three minutes, it builds up in your head
And you say, "yo, I can do that"
Just stand facing a wall
Your enemies are all around you
You can feel the tension right behind you
You might also like
.357 Magnum, 9 millimeter handgun
AK-47 and an Uzi submachine gun

Everybody's tryin' to take (Take)
Take over my spot
People just tryin' to take (Take)
Take what I got
See if I'm strapped, they can't get to me
Everybody's afraid of each other
You make enemies so easily just hangin' on the corner

Gang violence in Boston
Gang violence in Boston
Gang violence in Boston
Gang violence in Boston
Nathan!
Chains snatched a couple of times, shoes off your feet
Feel like you've got to arm yourself to protect yourself
Chains snatched a couple of times, shoes off your feet
Feel like you've got to arm yourself to protect yourself
(Kill, kill, kill, kill)
Help, help, help, help
Help, help, help, help!
What do you do if someone's packin'?
(What the hell can one man do?)
What do you do if he's crackin'?
Hope he can't shoot straight?
.357 Magnum, 9 millimeter handgun
