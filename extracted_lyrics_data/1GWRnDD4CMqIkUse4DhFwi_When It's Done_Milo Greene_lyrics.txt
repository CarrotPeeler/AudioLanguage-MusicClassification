1 ContributorWhen Itâ€™s Done LyricsWhen it's over, when it's done
We'll be older just because
You can break me down, break me down, break me down
When it's colder than I thought
But just to hold you is enough
I won't make a sound, make a sound, make a sound
Give me a speed, I feel sick
Shine your boots, boy this is it
Don't you see, now we're free
We won't have to make believe
I'm not dying before I feel you again
I'm not dying before I feel you again
When it's over, when it's done
Will we know it was enough?
Just to wait around, safe and sound, breaking down
You feel closer than I thought
But consolation of your touch
Oh, don't take me now, take me now, take me now
Give me a speed, I feel sick
Shine your boots, boy this is it
Don't you see, now we're free
We won't have to make believe
I'm not dying before I feel you again
I'm not dying before I feel you again
I'm not dying before I feel you again
I'm not dying before I feel you againYou might also likeEmbed
