1 ContributorEmpty Words Lyrics
I chased a light in vain to guide my way
I hear a voice betray the things you say
Nothing was left by darkness in the eyes of all that stare
Nothing but empty hands I offer nothing left to share

The times you said believe you're the one I have to trust
Nothing by empty words you heard
That's not what I'm about

Here I am
I'm the man I claim to be
Does it seem I'm always fighting
Always fighting
On and on
Cause I'm still standing
And I believe I can save myself from you
Does it seem we're always fighting
Always fighting on and on

Soon you test my faith in every way
The promises you made the things you say
You might also like



Here I am
I'm the man I claim to be
Cause I'm still standing
And I believe I can save myself from you
Does it seem we're always fighting
Always fighting on and onEmbed
