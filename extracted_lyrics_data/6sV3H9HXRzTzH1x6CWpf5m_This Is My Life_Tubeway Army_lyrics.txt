4 ContributorsThis Is My Life Lyrics
I'm not so sure
I still want more of this
My mind's not quite
Behaving right at all
I'm not feeling like I'm told I should

This is my life
Welcome to me tonight
I don't feel too
Glad to be here for sure
I'm not feeling any more at all

This is my head
This is my face
It's all my fault
This is my place
I don't really think I wanna stayYou might also likeEmbed
