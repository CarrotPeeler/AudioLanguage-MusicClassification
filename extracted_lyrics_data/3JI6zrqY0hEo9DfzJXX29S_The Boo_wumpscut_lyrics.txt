1 ContributorThe Boo LyricsIt's sleep time in your room
A light shine it's your doom
The danger the closed door
There's the danger on the floor
Danger danger
He is the boo
A faint noise in your room
Your father is your doom
Keep yoour eyes wide open
The door now is open
Danger the danger
I am the boo
Father is here
Father Father I am the boo
Father Father I will kill you
Father Father Sadie kills youYou might also likeEmbed
