5 ContributorsLondon by Night LyricsLondon by night is a wonderful sight
There is magic a brawl in the air
I'm often told that the street turn to gold
When the moon shines on circus and square
Deep in the dark that envelops the park
There's a man and his cigarette's low
Down by the Thames, lights that sparkle like gems
Seem to wink at each girl and her boy
Up comes the moon when the city's asleep
He's not alone for it sings
Somewhere up there stands an angel to keep her watch
While each Londener dreams
My love and I saw the sun leave the sky
Then we kissed in the fast fading light
Most people say they love London by day
But lovers love London by night
Most people they love London by day
But lovers love London by nightYou might also likeEmbed
