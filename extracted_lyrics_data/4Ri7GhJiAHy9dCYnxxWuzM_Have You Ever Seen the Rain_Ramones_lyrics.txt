4 ContributorsHave You Ever Seen the Rain? Lyrics
Someone told me long ago, there's a calm before the storm
I know, and it's been coming for some time
When it's over, so they say, it'll rain a sunny day
I know, shining down like water

I want to know, have you ever seen the rain?
I want to know, have you ever seen the rain
Coming down on a sunny day?

Yesterday, and days before, sun is cold and rain is hard
I know, been that way for all my time
Until forever on it goes through the circle fast and slow
I know, and it can't stop, I wonder

I want to know, have you ever seen the rain?
I want to know, have you ever seen the rain
Coming down on a sunny day?You might also likeEmbed
