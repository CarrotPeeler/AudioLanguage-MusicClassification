Light up the heart, in slow motion, as much as possible
If this short night is our last, then I’m sure I’d go see you
That’s how even I feel, in a carefree way
Crying as we hold each other
We can’t even talk about the pain
I love you so much even with your weaknesses
Ah, you should do a sketch
And give it to me
Along with my feelings, before you laugh
“Please don’t go”
“I don’t want you to go, either”
We made carefree promises as we punched each other on the shoulder
Although one of us always failed to keep their end
And it wasn’t me this time either
Your shaking hands were a signal
Yet I missed it so many times
Hey, a promise is just something to “keep”
All I really want is to hold hands
The more I long to remain the closest to you
The more I realize I can’t stay, that’s just the way it is
You might also likeThere aren’t many of those that just keep taking kindness
Perhaps it wouldn’t hurt as much if you thought of yourself as someone else?
Ahhh, the sensitive
Beautiful patterns of your heart are what I see
Your face distorts in reaction to other people’s pain
When and where will you laugh
Too busy counting wounds
How could I have missed your pain?
We pretended to act selfishly but
We’re always thinking of others
There’s always some pain that comes with happiness, so
I can’t let you go just because of some unhappiness – you understand?
Wishing for another heart
Don’t say something so sad
Just like you can’t see your own face
You need a mirror to reflect your heart
So please…
“Don’t disappear on me”
“You too”
We made carefree promises as we punched each other on the shoulder
Although one of us always failed to keep their end
But love is about enveloping what we take for granted
It looks like I’m more likely to
Give you my sketch of you
It might surprise you a little
But see, this is how beautiful your smiles areEmbed
