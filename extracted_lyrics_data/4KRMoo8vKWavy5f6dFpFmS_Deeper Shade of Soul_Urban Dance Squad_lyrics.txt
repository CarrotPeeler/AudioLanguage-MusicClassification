5 ContributorsDeeper Shade Of Soul Lyrics
Mellow, that's my style

Surprise, surprise! So you rub your eyes
Never knew UDS, so cool as ice?
Hear the vibes man, they'll stupefy
Ducks categorize us as hardcriers
That's a lie, we know why we're occupiers
No blurs, but obscure style and these are higher
Profiles are low, as soon as we go
As a breeze straight from a deeper shade of soul

A deeper shade of soul, yeah
A deeper shade of soul (Took a long time)
A deeper shade of soul, yeah
A deeper shade of soul (To who?)

Five souls play the head role
Excite the middle between the two poles
The globe rotates from new to old
UDS take both to reach the souls
Narrow mind clydes (suckers!), still holding a pose
To what we pour 'n flow when we come close
To the contrary, they pinch their earlobes
They call it rogue-rock, but it's a deeper shade of soul
You might also like
A deeper shade of soul, yeah
A deeper shade of soul
A deeper shade of soul, yeah
A deeper shade of soul

We blend everythin', with the color of skin
Under the skin, we're in like Flynn
Ducks stare at us, as soon as we begin
To innovate the frame of thought they are in
Again, music's got to do with only feeling
It's not where you're from, it's "Can they yield in?"
The stuff we rock and that we are giving
A piece of the mind connects with rhythm

A deeper shade of soul, yeah
A deeper shade of soul
A deeper shade of soul, yeah
A deeper shade of soul (Let the martians relax)

She don't want my money (what I say)
And no Cadillac (what I say)
Just wants my lovin' (what I say)
And to love me back (all right)
A deeper shade of soul, yeah
A deeper shade of soul
A deeper shade of soul, yeah
A deeper shade of soulEmbed
