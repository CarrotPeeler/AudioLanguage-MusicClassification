Oh wonderful one why are you like that?
Glow in the darkness, that's how we do it
Glow in the darkness, that's how we do it
Just like the stars upon your ceiling that
Put you to sleep after
Oh wonderful one why are you like that?
Oh wonderful one why are you like that?
Glow in the darkness, that's how we do it
Glow in the darkness, that's how we do it
Just like the stars upon your ceiling that
Put you to sleep after
Just like the stars upon your ceiling that
Put you to sleep after
Put you to sleep after
Put you to sleep after
Cause the light in the darkness of your room
In your room
In your room
There's your head now damaged from your talk-talk-talk
Hanging with your fears
Hanging with your tears
Cause here
We are
Apart but not
Again
And again
Again
And again
And it doesn't make sense
So put away your two cents
You might also likeI’ll be at your door
Coming at your life
Let me show, you’ve died
And in the end they ask you for
Your reply
Don't you tell them
What you found out
