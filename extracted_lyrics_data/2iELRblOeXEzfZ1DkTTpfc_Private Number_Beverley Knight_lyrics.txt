3 ContributorsPrivate Number Lyrics
Since I been gone you had your number changed
But my love for you boy still remains the same
I’ve been loving you
You’ve been loving me for so long
Baby what’s wrong

So I’m asking baby baby baby
Please let me have your number
Baby baby baby
Please let me have your number yeah

I’m sorry you couldn’t call me when you got home
Other fella’s kept on calling while you were gone
So I had my number changed
Girl I’m good at acting strange
Welcome home
Nothing is wrong

So I’m saying baby baby baby
You can have my private number yes you can
Baby baby baby
Please let me have your number
Yes you can now
