8 ContributorsThe Burning Red LyricsI see the sun begin to rise
And I'm blinded too
I've seen the world through
Jaded eyes that I'm crying through
I've watched the darkness hypnotize
And can't fight it
Hold on, I'm falling, can't
Breathe any more
An ocean has opened
These scars need to
Heal over
Caress the needle prick in my eye
The tears fell like rain
I've rode the Phoenix as she glides
And I've gone insane
I've seen the light of suicide
And I'm dying
Hold on, I'm falling, can't
Breathe any more
An ocean has opened
These scars need to
Heal over
