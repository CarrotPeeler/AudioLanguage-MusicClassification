Ah-ah, ah (Ah, ah)
Ah-ah, ah (Ah, ah)
Ah-ah, ah (Ah, ah)
Ah-ah, ah (Ah, ah)

You're so sexy
When you drive, so glad
You're alive, empty
If I were you, I'd drive on, Malibu

All alone in the city, love is blind
All alone in the city, love's a fight (In the sunrise)
I don't care, baby, tell me what to do (I want that light)
Drag me, oh, drag me down to you (Got that sunny life)
Drag me, oh, drag me down to you

Ah-ah, ah (Ah, ah)
Ah-ah, ah (Ah, ah)

You're so sexy (Ah, ah)
When you drive, so glad (Ah, ah)
You're alive in the rest of me (I am lost in you)
What you'd do, I'd drive on, Malibu (I am lost with you)
Drag
If I were you, I'd drag me
Where were you?
You might also like
(Yeah, hey!)

All alone in the city, love is blind
I don't care, baby, tell me what to do (In the sunrise)
I'll never, ever dump you (I want that light)
Drag me, oh, drag me into you ( Got that sunny life)
Drag me, oh, drag me down to you (I want life)
Drag me, oh, drag me down to you

I pity all of you tonight
I pity everyone (I want that light)
I pity everyone alive (I want that light)
I pity all of you alive (I want that light)
I pity everyone
I pity everyone alive

Drive, baby, drive all the way to Malibu
Drive all the way to Malibu
Drop everything that wasn't you
Drive all the way to Malibu
Drop every dime that wasn't you
Drive all the way to Malibu
I pity everyone tonight
I pity everyone
(I pity all of you tonight)Embed
