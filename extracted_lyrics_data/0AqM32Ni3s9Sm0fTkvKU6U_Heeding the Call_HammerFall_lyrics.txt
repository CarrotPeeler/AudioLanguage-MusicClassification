A journey through time
The Templars are back on the streets
Guarded by prowess
And the will to survive
All led by the guiding light
Angels of mercy, guardians of time
Shackled and chained
Through the eternal flame
The Hammer will slowly arise
Heeding the call
One and for all
Never surrender, with glory we fall
Brothers unite, let's stand up and fight
Fulfilling our fate
We are heeding the call
One step ahead, revealing the past
United, together we stand
The call of the thunder
The sign to begin
This final crusade we will win
Angels of mercy
Our journey must proceed
With hearts all filled up with chivalry
The lifeblood that we all need

We are heeding the call
Heeding the call
One and for all
Never surrender, with glory we fall
Brothers unite, let's stand up and fight
Fulfilling our fate
We are heeding the call
Heeding the call
One and for all
Never surrender, with glory we fall
Brothers unite, let's stand up and fight
Fulfilling our fate
We are heeding the callEmbed
