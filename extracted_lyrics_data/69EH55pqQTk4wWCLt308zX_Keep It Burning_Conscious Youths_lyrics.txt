1 ContributorKeep it Burning Lyrics
I burn keep-it-keep-it burn keep-it (keep it burning)
I burn wide awake I burn sleepy (keep it burning)
I burn keep-it-keep-it burn keep-it (keep it burning)
All I ever asked for is to be free

I’m a put C.Y. in my CV / paper tiga dem rocking MTV
Burn CDs and MP3s / not the kinda Paleface that burn teepees

They call me L-I-L-R-E-D / they say my language is graphic banging in 3D
So if you jammed to the traffic or if you baggin’ that baggage
I’ll give you half of my sandwich ’cos I ain’t greedy

They call me Cape to the N-A-P-E / got a TV but I don’t watch the BB
For really / that don’t appeal to me / that shit is fake, bro / that ain’t real to me
Ay yo, it’s clear to see what we really need is liquid unity served in bottles distillery
It’s killing me / agony and the misery / but the breath of the dragon just keeps sizzling


Keep keepin’ on in Afghanistan and wherever King George is steppin’ on
Iran, Lebanon, Vietnam, Falun Gong / On and on bang the drum til the early morn
Keep keepin' on in Khalistan / Uzbekistan, Kurdistan, Pakistan
Tajikistan / Turkmenistan / on and on bang the drum til Ramadan
You might also like
They say Redrama gone but I keep keepin’ on
The wrong day, the wrong song to be sleepin’ on
I went from tired to on fire from weak to strong
Mental battle I’mma take the Grim Reaper on
During the week it’s on but when the weekends gone
You right back to square one like that PF song
If you think life’s a bitch you the peeping tom
See I know life’s a gift so I’m keepin on

You can see me flippin’ on / when the beat is on
You thought I never would / now I bring it on
Street music’s on / not a silly song / sayin’ everything is everything / we killin’ ’em
King size papes we be fillin’ up / ring side Napes we be chillin’ out
You think we sit around / your feet will hit the ground
Don’t you worry yourself / so get the picture now
