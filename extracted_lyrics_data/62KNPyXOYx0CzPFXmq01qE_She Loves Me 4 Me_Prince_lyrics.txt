3 ContributorsShe Loves Me 4 Me Lyrics
With this one I can be what I want to be
I don't have to live up to no one's fantasy
I could write another three hundred melodies
To her it's just three, cause this one
She loves me for me
With this one I don't even have to comb my hair
I can wear what I want to or nothing, she don't care
I don't even have to take her on the rollercoaster, see

Cause this one, this one
She loves me for me

In the morning
When I rise and see her eyes
Look deep into mine
I find a better place
This one I can tell all my secrets to
I don't need to make her swear, she would never tell any who
Besides I'm the only one she ever wants to see

Cause this one, this one
She loves me for me
You might also like
When the night falls
And she calls
I run to her side
'Cause she got the ride that I like to ride
I like to ride it

This one I can take over my mamma's house
And I don't have to worry what goes in and out her mouth
All she needs is a little gratuity
She don't like no beef

She just loves me for me
She just loves me for me

This one, this one, ooh
She loves me for meEmbed
