Will it be the same tomorrow or will we have regrets
Will we still be on our minds
Will the need be this easy to find
After the feeling is gone, oh will you want me, will I still want you, baby
After the feeling is gone, oh will things still be the same
What seems right for now tomorrow's sun may show in a different light
Will there be a second time around in another life
Will we leave what we've done behind
Can the need be this easy to find
After the feeling is gone, oh will you want me, will I still want you, baby
After the feeling is gone, oh will things still be the same
Will we leave what we've done behind
Can the need be this easy to find
After the feeling is gone, oh will you want me, will I still want you, baby
After the feeling is gone, oh will you want me, will I still want you, baby
After the feeling is gone, oh will you want me, will I still want you, babyYou might also likeEmbed
