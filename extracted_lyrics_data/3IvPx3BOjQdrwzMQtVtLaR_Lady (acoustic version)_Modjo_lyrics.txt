3 ContributorsLady (Acoustic Version) Lyrics
Lady, hear me tonight
'Cause my feeling, is just so right
As we dance, by the moonlight
Can't you see, you're my delight
Lady, I just feel like
I won't get you, out of my mind
I feel love, for the first time
And I know that it's true, I can tell by the look in your eyes

Lady, hear me tonight
'Cause my feeling, is just so right
Lady, I just feel like
I won't get you, out of my mind

Lady, hear me tonight
'Cause my feeling, is just so right
As we dance, by the moonlight
Can't you see, you're my delight
Lady, I just feel like
I won't get you, out of my mind
I feel love, for the first time
And I know that it's true, I can tell by the look in your eyes
You might also like
Lady, hear me tonight
'Cause my feeling, is just so right
Lady, I just feel like
I won't get you, out of my mind
Lady, hear me tonight
Can't you see, you're my delight
Lady, hear me tonight
I feel love, for the first time
Lady, hear me tonight
'Cause my feeling, is just so right
