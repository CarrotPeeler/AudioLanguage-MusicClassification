5 ContributorsThe Devilâ€™s Crayon Lyrics
This truly is the Devil's crayon
Tracing your shoulder blades aglow like rayon
This truly is the Devil's crayon
That all his children can use to draw

And we are so many tiny pieces
And we are so many tiny pieces

This truly is the Devil's answer
Carved from the tongue of this romancer
This truly is the Devil's answer
That all his children use to kiss

And we are so many clambering hands
And we are so many clambering hands

The way you say her name I want mine said the same, Devil!
Devil! Devil! Devil!
The way you say her name I want mine said the same. Devil!

This truly is the Devil's shoulder
Your arm draped around ten times over
This truly is the Devil's shoulder
That all his children will use to throw
Their loads, their loads on you
To throw their loads on you
You might also like
And we are so much moulded dough
- And we are so much moulded dough
Used to throw their loads on you
Used to throw their loads on youEmbed
