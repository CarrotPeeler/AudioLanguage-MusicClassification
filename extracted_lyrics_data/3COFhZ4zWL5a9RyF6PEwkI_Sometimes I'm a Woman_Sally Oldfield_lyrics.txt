If you're ever gonna make me cry
If you're ever gonna run and leave me
Don't tell me why
Just leave early in the morning, leave me at the break of day
Just leave me in the silence, I can find my way
Sometimes I'm a woman, sometimes I'm a child
Sometimes I let my feelings run away and I'm acting strange and wild
But when you take me in your arms it feels so right
I wanna tell you tonight I will be with you until the very end
Sometimes I get the feeling, that I don't know what to do
Sometimes I want to run and hide, want to run to you
Sometimes I feel like laughin' at the stories that we tell
The only thing I really know is we know each other well
Sometimes I'm a woman, sometimes I'm a child
Sometimes I let my feelings run away and I'm acting strange and wild
But when you take me in your arms it feels so right
I wanna tell you tonight I will be with you until the very end
Sometimes I'm a woman, sometimes I'm a child
Sometimes I let my feelings run away and I'm acting strange and wild
But when you take me in your arms it feels so right
I wanna tell you tonight I will be with you until the very end
I let my feelings run away
I'm a woman, sometimes I'm a childYou might also likeEmbed
