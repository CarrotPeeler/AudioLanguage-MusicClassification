1 ContributorCreep Along Moses LyricsDidn't old pharaoh get lost, get lost, get lost
Didn't old pharaoh get lost, yes, tryin' to cross the Red Sea
Ol' Satan wears an old iron shoe
Tryin' to cross the Red Sea
If you don't mind he'll slip it on you
Tryin' to cross the Red Sea
I wonder what the devil keeps grumblin' about
Tryin' to cross the Red Sea
He's down in hell and he can't get out
Tryin' to cross the Red Sea
Creep along, Moses, Moses creep along
Creep along Moses, I thank God
Creep along, Moses, Moses creep along
Creep along Moses, I'm going home
Didn't old pharaoh get lost, yes, tryin' to cross the Red Sea
I went down in the valley to say a little prayer
Tryin' to cross the Red Sea
When I got there, ol' Satan was there
Tryin' to cross the Red Sea
And I fell down upon my knees
Tryin' to cross the Red Sea
I cried "Lord have mercy, if You please"
Creep along, Moses, Moses creep along
Creep along Moses, I thank God
Creep along, Moses, Moses creep along
Creep along Moses, I'm going home
Didn't old pharaoh get lost, get lost, get lost
Didn't old pharaoh get lost, yes, tryin' to cross the Red SeaSee Mavis Staples LiveGet tickets as low as $105You might also likeEmbed
