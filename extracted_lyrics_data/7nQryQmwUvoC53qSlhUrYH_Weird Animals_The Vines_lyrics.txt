1 ContributorWeird Animals LyricsI don't wanna live
I don't wanna die
I ain't gotta give
I ain't gonna try
All my spirit gone
Fade into the sun
What's it gonna take
'Til we all become
Weird animals
Hey!
Walkin' down the street
Second time again
Lookin' for a sign
Lookin' for a friend
All my spirit gone
Fade into the sun
What's it gonna take
'Til we all become
Weird animals
Weird animals
