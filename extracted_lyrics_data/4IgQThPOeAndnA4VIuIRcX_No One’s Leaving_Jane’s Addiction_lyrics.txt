11 ContributorsNo Oneâ€™s Leaving Lyrics
Ooh, I'm a white dread, I'm a white dread, so?
I'm a got a ring and I hang it from my nose
Got a little game, I take it to the park
I don't care who plays, as long as the game is on

My sister and her boyfriend slept in the park
Had to leave home because he was dark
Now they parade around in New York
With a baby boy, he's gorgeous!

Ain't nobody leavin'
Let's go!
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
No one is leavin'

Blacks call each other brother and sis'
Count me in because I been missed
I've seen color changed by a kiss
Go ask my brother and my sister

My sister and her boyfriend slept in the park
Had to leave home because he was dark
Now they parade around in New York
With a baby boy, he's gorgeous!

Ain't nobody leaving!
And why?
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
No one is leavin'


No is leavin'

Yeah, that's right
Yeah, that's so, go!

I wish I knew everyone's nickname
All their slang and all their sayings
Every way to show affection
How to dress to fit the occasion
And I wish we all waved, all waved
All waved
I wish we all! Wish we all!
Wish we all waved1Embed
