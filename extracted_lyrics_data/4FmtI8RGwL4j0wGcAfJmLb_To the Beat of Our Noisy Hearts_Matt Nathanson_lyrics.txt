5 ContributorsTo The Beat Of Our Noisy Hearts LyricsShe don't lie in bed at night
Staring at the ceiling
She don't wait to begin
She bets on long shots
She wants what they've got
She skates where the ice thins

On and on, we keep going
Crowded like subway cars
On and on, to the beat of our noisy hearts
Our hearts
She was her mother's secret
She was daddy's girl
She brought weekend boys home in her curls
She said, "My love is a fever
Come on, touch my skin
They all think I'm easy
I'm easy, cause I let them win."

On and on, we keep going
Crowded like subway cars
On and on, to the beat of our noisy hearts
On and on, we keep going
Crowded like subway cars
On and on, to the beat of our noisy hearts
To the beat of our noisy hearts

Cause I need to get more alone
And your voice drives me crazy."

On and on, we keep going
Crowded like subway cars
On and on, to the beat of our noisy hearts
On and on, we keep going
Crowded like subway cars
On and on, to the beat of our noisy hearts, hearts, hearts
On and on, we keep going
Crowded like subway cars
On and on, to the beat of our noisy heartsEmbed
