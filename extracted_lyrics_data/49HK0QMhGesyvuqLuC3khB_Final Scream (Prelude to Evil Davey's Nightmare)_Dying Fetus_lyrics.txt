2 ContributorsFinal Scream (Prelude to Evil: Daveyâ€™s Nightmare) Lyrics(Instrumental)
Davey!
Yes daddy?
It's 8:30 boy it's time you were in bed!
But daaaad!
Don't argue with me Davey!
But dad! I'm 26 years old!
Physically yes Davey, but you're not like other 26 year old boys are you? You're a god damn child in your own mind!
Oh please daddy!
Don't push me boy!
(Davey gets his ass beat and cries)
I warned you Davey GET TO BED NOW!
Oh, goodnight daddy!
Goodnight Davey, pleasant dreams! (laughs evilly)
