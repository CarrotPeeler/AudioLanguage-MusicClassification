At the dark end of the street
That's where we always meet
Hiding in shadows where we don't belong
Living in darkness to hide our wrong

You and me
At the dark end of the street
You and me

I know time's gonna take its toll
We have to pay for the love we stole
It's a sin, and we know it's wrong
Oh, but our love keeps comin' on strong

Steal away (Steal away)
To the dark end of the street
Mm-hmm

They're gonna find us
They're gonna find us
They're gonna find us, oh some day
You might also like
You and me
At the dark end, the dark end of the street
You and me

And when the daylight rolls around
And by chance we're both downtown
If we should meet just walk right on by
Oh darling, please don't cry

Tonight we'll meet (We'll meet)
At the dark end of the street
Mm, mm-mm-mm, mmEmbed
