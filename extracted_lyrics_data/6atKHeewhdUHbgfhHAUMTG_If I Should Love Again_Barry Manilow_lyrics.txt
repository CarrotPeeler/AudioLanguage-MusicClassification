6 ContributorsIf I Should Love Again Lyrics
Oh, my love, you were the only one
Now you're gone, and I'm alone
All my friends
They say what's done is done
I pretend, but deep inside, I know

If I should love again
If I find someone new
It would be made believe
For in my heart, it would be you
And though I hold her close
And want her now and then
I'll still be loving you if I should love again

All day long, I keep remembering
All the night, I think of you
All my life, you'll be the song I sing
I'll get by, but this I swear is true

If I should love again
If I find someone new
It would be make-believe
For in my heart, it would be you
And though I hold her close
And want her now and then
I'll still be loving you if I should love again
If I should love again
If I find someone new
It would be make-believe
For in my heart, it would be you
And though I hold her close
And want her now and then
I'll still be loving you if I should love againYou might also likeEmbed
