Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Take good care of yourself
Take good care of yourself
I worry 'bout you
When you're gone
When you leave my arms
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I feel so bad
I just think about
The good times we had
And when we kiss goodnight
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, I wanna cry
I can't wait 'til you're back
Back in my arms again
Ooh baby
Take good care of yourself
Take good care of yourself
I worry 'bout you
Ooh, when you're gone
You might also likeI wish there could be
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
A way for us
To be together
Both day and night
When I see you leave
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
How thoughtful, aren't we
Call as soon as you
Walk in that door
And I won't have to
Worry no more
Take good care of yourself
Take good care of yourself
I worry 'bout you
Ooh-ooh, when you're gone
Ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh
So baby, baby
Take good care of yourself
I worry 'bout you, 'bout you
Take good care of yourself
Take good care of yourself
Take good care of yourself
Take good care of yourself
Take good care of yourself
Take good care of yourself
Take good care of yourself
Take good care of yourself
Take good care of yourself
Take good care of yourself
Take good care of yourself
Take good care of yourself
I worry 'bout you, 'bout you
'bout you, 'bout you, 'bout you, baby
I worry 'bout you, yeah
I worry 'bout you, 'bout you
'bout you, 'bout you, 'bout you, baby
Don't you worry 'bout me
I worry 'bout you, 'bout you
'bout you, 'bout you, 'bout youEmbed
