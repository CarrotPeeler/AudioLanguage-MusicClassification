8 ContributorsAll I Ever Wanted Lyrics
I lie here, alone and wonder why
That I come alive, just before I have to hide
'Cause I believe I'm losing my nerve
But could I ever do, better than this?

'Cause all I've ever wanted, was a place to call my home
To shelter me when I am there, and to miss me when I'm gone
All I've ever wanted, was a place to call my own
Where stars will dance and sun still shines, and the storms feel free to roam

I listen, if only for a while
But I can't decide, if I'm aware that I'm on trial
'Cause I believe I'm losing my nerve
But could I ever do, better than this?

'Cause all I've ever wanted, was a place to call my home
To shelter me when I am there, and to miss me when I'm gone
All I've ever wanted, was a place to call my own
Where stars will dance and sun still shines, and the storms feel free to roam

If there's a way to a remedy then lead me straight to it
If there's a path or a door I missed, then show me now, well show me this

'Cause all I've ever wanted, was a place to call my home
To shelter me when I am there, and to miss me when I'm gone
'Cause all I've ever wanted, was a place to call my own
Where stars will dance and sun still shines, and the storms feel free to roam

Feel free, when I am goneEmbed
