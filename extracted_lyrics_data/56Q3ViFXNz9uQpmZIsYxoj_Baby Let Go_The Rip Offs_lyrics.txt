1 ContributorBaby Let Go LyricsWhoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa, baby let go
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa, baby let go
Na-na-na-na-na-na, don't say no
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa, baby let go
Just wanna see you smile
Like you used to do
Let's do it doggy style
And get a free shampoo
(One, two, three, four!)
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa, baby let go
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa, baby let go
Na-na-na-na-na-na, don't say no
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa, baby let go
Don't know how it started
Know how it's gonna end
Don't change your attitude
Or at least pretend
(One, two, three, wha!)

You are the way you are
Same thing goes for me
Let's give it one more try
Or maybe two or three
(One, two, three, four!)
