2 ContributorsMonday Monday Lyrics
I wake up, every day starts with a phone call
Phone Paul with a problem day what's-her-face forgets her name
Man how you gonna forget your name
Same illusion, it's just a different day
Misread the roster, rocking up a little late to work
Flirting with the barista instead of serving customers
Nah fuck it, I ain't having it
A losing battle whenâ€”when the customer
Is mad and plans to take a rant to Urbanspoon
Order two Nasi Gorengs expecting German food
What you want me to say?
Kill 'em with kindness, rather get my grenade
Lemons to lemonade, say the customer is always right
Well Christ, what if the customer is nothing but a bitch?
I can't keep doing this
Can't keep doing this, man
Rather give her a bag of dicks, I ain't meaning Japanese cuisine
There ain't no delicacy, yep yep yeah you can can leave
(What?!) I said would you like a receipt
(Oh, yes please) Yo, I can't stand you fucking people
(Excuse me?) I said come back again
I even saved your favourite table, it's always a pleasure to see you
Deepak told me I gotta breathe
Instead I fall apart at the seems
You might also like
'Cause every day's been a Monday
For so long
Then you know, you know, you know
I seem to blink and the day is over
Then you know, you know, you know
It's Monday again
Again, again
It's Monday again, yeah
Just another Monday again, again

I know
Man, I shouldn't take their pain personal
Like murder-ball, they're killin' you
Without a leg to stand on and I know you can't feel your feet
'Cause you steppin' all over my toes when they are underneath
End of my tether with everyone
Living in civil unrest, no security like I'm Lebanon
Forget 'em all Paul, go and live on an island in Thailand
No finance, just me, myself and I and my guitar
Serenading my lady under the stars, nothing but fucking love
Ah, no alarms in my luggage
A groundhog day without Bill Murray is fucking rubbish
Love it, hate it, messing my being
Yelling at these kids it wasn't part of my dream
Thich Nhat Hanh told me to breathe
Instead I fall apart at the seems
'Cause every day's been a Monday
For so long
Then you know, you know, you know
I seem to blink and the day is over
Then you know, you know, you know
It's Monday again
Again, again
It's Monday again
Just another Monday again, againEmbed
