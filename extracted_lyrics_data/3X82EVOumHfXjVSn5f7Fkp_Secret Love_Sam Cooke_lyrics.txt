3 ContributorsSecret Love Lyrics
Once I had a secret love
That lived within the heart of me
All too soon my secret love
Became impatient to be free
So I told a friendly star
The way that dreamers often do
Just how wonderful you are
And why I'm so in love with you

Now I shouted from the highest hill
Even told the golden daffodils

At last my heart's an open door
And my secret love's no secret anymore


At last my heart's an open door
And my secret love's no secret anymoreYou might also likeEmbed
