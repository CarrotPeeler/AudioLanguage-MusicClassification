It's getting colder
And darker every day
And all the bloodred flowers
Slowly turn to grey

We need some wind to blow the clouds away
We need a sun to dry the rain
We need to break the chain of yesterday
We need a storm to kill the pain

I don't remember
Nothing but a minor chord
There's still some ember
Of the fire you adored

We need some wind to blow the clouds away
We need a sun to dry the rain
We need to break the chain of yesterday
We need a storm to kill the pain
We need some wind to blow the clouds away
We need it today, we need it today
We need a sun to dry the rain
To kill the pain, to kill the pain
You might also like
And when the thunder opens Hell
Walking down the border of farewell
I'd cut your hand off so I'd never let it go
Is this the final, the climax of the show?

We need some wind to blow the clouds away
We need a sun to dry the rain
We need to break the chain of yesterday
We need a storm to kill the pain
We need some wind to blow the clouds away
We need a sun to dry the rain
We need to break the chain of yesterday
We need a storm to kill the pain
We need some wind to blow the clouds away
We need it today, we need it today
We need a sun to dry the rain
To kill the pain, to kill the painEmbed
