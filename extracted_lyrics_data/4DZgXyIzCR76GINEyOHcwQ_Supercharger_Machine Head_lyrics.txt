Charge

Electricity is pulsing
Through our veins a charge is racing
A chain reaction through the four of us to you will make
The transformers begin converting into overdrive
Power surge now exploding through
Energy, filling the ominous void within you
No need to live your life in that gap
Got what you need right here on lightning tap, so

Charge me, charge you
Charge us, charge through
Amplify, terrify
Supercharger electrifies

Getting under skin, we're like a rash
Spreading over your body
We are the itch you scratch
That doesn't seem to go away
Protons, neutrons, electrons
Synchronizing into one
See Machine Head LiveGet tickets as low as $42You might also likeIn sheer power, all will pale
Heaviness of the Richter Scale
Forever crushing the competition in their tracks
One hundred thousand volts we blast, so

Charge me, charge you
Charge us, charge through
Amplify, terrify
Supercharger electrifies

Oh my fuckin' god!

You're little sticks of dynamite
We're the fuse and we're the light

Electricity is pulsing
Through our veins a charge is racing
A chain reaction through the four of us
To you, has made
It's crystal clear we'll win this war
Destiny... victory
Braveheart-mindset, full attack
Kamikaze, never look back
In this war, a victory is if you feel this too
You feed off us and we feed off you, so

Charge me, charge you
Charge us, charge through
Amplify, terrify
Supercharger electrifies
Charge me, charge you
Charge us, charge through
