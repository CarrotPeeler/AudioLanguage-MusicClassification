1 ContributorToo Late LyricsToo late too late too late
Tired of your deceiving and
I can't stand your grieving I'm gone
Too late too late too late
Tired of all your fussing and
I can't stand your cussing I'm gone
Tired of all your fussing and
I can't stand your cussing I'm gone
Do you know I love you
I don't know just why
I thought though I love you
But today I say bye bye bye bye
Too late too late too late
I can't stand your cooking and
You ain't good looking I'm gone
I can't stand your cooking and
You ain't good looking I'm gone
Moving on, so long, I'm gone
Do you know I love you
I don't know just why
I thought though I love you
But today I say bye bye bye bye
Too late too late too late
You might also likeI can't stand your beating
And I'm tired of all your cheating I'm gone
I can't stand your beating
And I'm tired of all your cheating I'm gone
I can't stand your cheating
And I'm tired of all your beating I'm gone
I can't stand your cooking and
You ain't good looking I'm gone
I can't stand your cooking and
You ain't good looking I'm goneEmbed
