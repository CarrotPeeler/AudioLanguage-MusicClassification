She's a dumb little girl
Who pushes to get higher
She's a teaser - and she's a squeezer
You gotta get away from her
'Cause she's a cheater
Don't wanna be loved by you
(Loved by you…)
She has made your brown eyes blue
(Brown eyes blue…)
Gotta leave her alone 'cause she's a liar
Baby she's a liar!!!
Don't let her get down on you
(Down on you…)
Don't let her pull tricks on you
(Tricks on you…)
She's a girl who likes to play with fire…
She's a dreamer - and she's a screamer
She's not the kind of girl
Like people see her
She's a looser - and she's a boozer
She likes to get it done her way
So she can use ya
You might also likeDon't wanna be loved by you
(Loved by you…)
She has made your brown eyes blue
(Brown eyes blue…)
Gotta leave her alone 'cause she's a liar
Baby she's a liar!!!
Don't let her get down on you
(Down on you…)
Don't let her pull tricks on you
(Tricks on you…)
She's a girl who likes to play with fire…
She's a dreamer
Liar - yeah she's a crier
She's a dumb little girl
Who pushes to get higher
She's a looser - and she's a boozer
She likes to get it done her way
So she can use ya
So try to understand she's no good for you
She'll be always looking for some one new
