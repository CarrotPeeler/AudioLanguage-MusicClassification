8 ContributorsTonight (We Need a Lover) Lyrics
Ninety-thousand screamin' watts
Honey drippin' from her pot
Fill the cup to the top, tonight
This deadly sin is all we know
Pleasure victim, who's next to fall?
The question is, will you please us all tonight?

Tonight, tonight, tonight
We need a lover tonight
We need a lover tonight
We need a lover tonight
We need a lover

Stand tall an' ring the bell
The final stroke sends you to hell
Take your body like a hammer and a nail
The taste of love, it might be yours
Slide down my knees and take my sword
Can you feel the power inside, tonight?

Oh, tonight, tonight, tonight
We need a lover tonight
We need a lover tonight
We need a lover tonight
We need a lover
You might also like

(Tonight, tonight)
(Tonight, tonight)
(Tonight, tonight)
(Tonight, tonight)
Ooh, tonight

We need a lover tonight
We need a lover tonight
We need a lover tonight
We need a lover


Tonight, tonight
Tonight, tonight
Tonight, tonight
Tonight, tonight
Tonight, tonight
Tonight, tonight
Tonight, tonightEmbed
