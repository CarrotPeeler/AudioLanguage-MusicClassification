Put your hands up
This is a stash up
Pull the trigger and you're gonna get mashed up
Put your hands up
This is a stash up
Pull the trigger and you're gonna get mashed up
Put your hands up
This is a stash up
Pull the trigger and you're gonna get mashed up
Put your hands up
This is a stash up
Pull the trigger and you're gonna get mashed up

Check your ass up
Smoke grass up
And if you in the back then you gonna get passed up
Mateo, better pass me that bong
The night is short and I've been waitin' too long
To enter into another dimension
Pull the smoke into my lungs
And release the tension
And by the way, did I happen to mention
Stash operates so start the dissection
You might also like
One, two: Don't forget your crew now
Three, four: Sit facin' the door
Five, six: Never know when it hits
Seven, eight: It's gonna be too late

Put your hands up
This is a stash up
Pull the trigger and you're gonna get mashed up
Put your hands up
This is a stash up
Pull the trigger and you're gonna get mashed up
Put your hands up
This is a stash up
Pull the trigger and you're gonna get mashed up
Put your hands up
This is a stash up
Pull the trigger and you're gonna get mashed up

Now I don't give a fuck
Not a single fuck
Not a single solitary fuck
'Cause I don't give a fuck, motherfucker
I don't give a fuck
Not a single fuck
Not a single solitary fuck
'Cause I don't give a fuck, motherfucker
Ring the alarm
And now the sound is dying, whoa
Ring the alarm
And now the stash is creeping, whoa

Psychological
Past diabolical
Encrypted in code biological
Rejected
Genetically defected
Or maybe just slightly misdirected
Murder by numbers
Straight undercover
Step into my cypher and you're six feet under
Do a dance and let her know that you're feelin' it
Locked up 'cause you know I was dealin' it

Hydroponic, super bionic
My HK is chrome and my bombs are atomic
Step to the back with your monkey ass
Better take cover 'cause we're ready to blast
(Blakka, blakka, blakka, blakka)
Now I don't give a fuck
Not a single fuck
Not a single solitary fuck
'Cause I don't give a fuck, motherfucker
I don't give a fuck
Not a single fuck
Not a single solitary fuck
'Cause I don't give a fuck, motherfucker
I don't give a fuck
Not a single fuck
Not a single solitary fuck
'Cause I don't give a fuck, motherfucker
I don't give a fuck
Not a single fuck
Not a single solitary fuck
'Cause I don't give a fuck, motherfucker
I don't give a fuck
Not a single fuck
Not a single solitary fuck
'Cause I don't give a fuck, motherfucker
I don't give a fuck
Not a single fuck
Not a single solitary fuck
'Cause I don't give a fuck, motherfucker
I don't give a fuck
Not a single fuck
Not a single solitary fuck
'Cause I don't give a fuck, motherfucker
I don't give a fuck
Not a single fuck
Not a single solitary fuck
'Cause I don't give a fuck, motherfuckerEmbed
