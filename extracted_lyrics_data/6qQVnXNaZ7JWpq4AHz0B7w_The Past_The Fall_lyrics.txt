4 ContributorsThe Eternal Sea LyricsWe carry memories
Of mass disembarkment
From Spirit-ships
Thoughts of the past
The Fall of The Explorer
The Tears of the Seamen
We dream of what is coming
Fading shapes will be rewritten
Endless Light from peaceful sleep
Thoughts of what is to come
The stars who shone when we broke
Will be our beacons
Let us take you over limbic waters
On winds who still speak
The tongues of old blue yonders
Let us be your craft
Sails unfolded outside of time
Beyond the reach of our brethren's demise
We are of the waters
Carrying the Countless Names
Above, below, absorbed and besung
We are of the Eternal Sea
