10 ContributorsWorld Ablaze Lyrics
Can you feel it?
The expectancy
Of our deepest desires
In one moment
In one second
Watch it all burn

You and I
Will stand as one
You and I will be transformed
This is the promise
This is the gift
We hold this truth
Go

Shed the weight of this world
The burden has been lifted
Let it all fall
Let it all fall

Set this world ablaze
We alone remain
Don't fear what awaits
We alone remain

You and I (You and I)
Will stand as one
You and I will be transformed
Go

Shed the weight of this world
The burden has been lifted
Let it all fall
Let it all fall

Set this world ablaze
We alone remain
Don't fear what awaits
We alone remain

Let the skies turn black
Let the infection burn
This is the new beginning
Embrace eternity
Let it all fall

Set this world ablaze
Let it all fall
Set this world ablaze
Let it all fall
Set this world ablaze
Let it all fall
Set this world ablaze
Let it all fall
Set this world ablaze
Let it all fall1Embed
