2 ContributorsSort Me Out LyricsCome around these city streets
Like a dead and lonely been set free
Did my time under my head stone
Wanna be another broken ghost
Come sort me out
Come and sort me out, oh yeah
Come and break me down, oh yeah
I've been in pieces since you've gone
No one else but you can right this wrong
So come and sort me out
Restless sin with a careless heart
Help me up to watch me fall apart
Forcing me upon this dirty floor
I curse your name while I beg for more
Come sort me out
Come and sort me out, oh yeah
Come and break me down, oh yeah
I've been in pieces since you've gone
No one else but you can right this wrong
Tell myself that I keep moving on
So come and sort me out
Come around these city streets
Like a dead and lonely been set free
Did my time under my head stone
Wanna be another broken ghost

Come and sort me out, oh yeah
Come and break me down, oh yeah
I've been in pieces since you've gone
No one else but you can right this wrong
Tell myself that I keep moving on
So come and sort me outEmbed
