1 ContributorFlesh and Blood LyricsAaaah come sit beside me
That'll do for now
The night has come and left me
Just the light that you allow
Come speak my name
Fill my head with all such foolish dreams
My flesh and blood is no more real to me
Than what they seem
My love for you is burning
Like a sparkle along a fuse
I feel your mark upon me now
As surely as the hand that leaves the bruise
Life is for the living
And life comes hard for some
The rest of us, with flesh and blood
Make it hard all on our own
All I ever wanted
Was the freedom to refuse
Or something of my own to love enough
To hate to lose
The fever in my brain is leaving
Smoke behind my eyes
When the part of me that wants to change
Fights the part of me that tries
You might also likeNow you see a golden light
Because Iâ€™ve turned a gold light on
Sometimes, God knows, you've got to
Learn to shine shine shine shine all on your own
I stepped out of darkness
And for a moment I'm only living by your kiss
Your kiss, your kiss, your kiss, your lips, your kiss, your kiss
And now, just for now our flesh and blood
Is no more real than this
More real than this
More real than this
More more more more more more more more more more more more real than this
Flesh and blood is more real than this
More real than this
More real than this
Flesh and blood
Flesh and blood
More real than this
More real
More real than thisEmbed
