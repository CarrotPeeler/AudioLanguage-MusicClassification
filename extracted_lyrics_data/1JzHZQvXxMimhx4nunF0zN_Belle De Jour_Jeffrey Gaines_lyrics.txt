1 ContributorBelle De Jour LyricsYour time is now
Don't let it pass
My beautiful flower
For it won't last
You can be sure
That time will take its toll
What's new today
One day grows old
Youth is like fuel
It propels the world
Survival is cruel
And you're a sweet little girl
Watch how they adore you
For they're drawn to your light
Condemned to recall
How they once burned bright
There's nothing you can do
Just let them follow you
There's nothing you can change
It's always been the same
It's your beauty, nothing more
Like a glamor galore
Of one thing I'm sure
You're the belle de jour
You must realize
The gift you possess
They're all drawn like flies
To bear witness
Just like the birth of spring
You thaw the frost
But like everything
There comes a cost
There's nothing you can do
Just let them follow you
There's nothing you can change
It's always been this strange
It's your beauty, nothing more
Like a glamor galore
Of one thing I'm sure
You're the belle de jour
Your time is now
Don't let it pass
My beautiful flower
For it won't last
You can be sure
That time will take its toll
What's new today
One day grows oldYou might also likeEmbed
