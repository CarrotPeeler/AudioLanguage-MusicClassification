2 ContributorsIf There’s Black Smoke Over A Bridge, It’s Over LyricsI'm awake but I'm dreaming
You kept me alive screaming
No tears for me tonight
I'm awake but I'm dreaming
You kept me alive screaming
Can't see straight, nothing but miles of smiles
Trade your logic
Trade it all for fun
I am not growing up at all
Trade your logic for life
I'm awake but I'm dreaming
You kept me alive screaming
No tears for me tonight
I'm awake but I'm dreaming
You kept me alive screaming
Can't see straight, nothing but miles of smiles
Stay poor and you
Will stay happy
Stop counting
You will stay free
Stay dirty, stay pretty
I see alternatives
Alternatives

What you call wasting time, I call working
What you call working is a waste of time
The dirty kids are changing the world tonightEmbed
