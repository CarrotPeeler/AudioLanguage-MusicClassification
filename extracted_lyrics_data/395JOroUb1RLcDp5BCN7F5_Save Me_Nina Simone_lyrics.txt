8 ContributorsSave Me Lyrics
Save me, somebody save me
Save me, somebody save me

I promised myself after the last romance
That I wouldn't give it a second chance
They say to you seek, you're sure to find
And I know how true that is
'Cause the closer I get to you, baby, yeah
You're driving me clean out of my mind

I say save me, somebody save me
Anybody save me, somebody save me

Those who love always give the most
We're cryin' together from coast to coast
'Cause love makes me cold and hurt inside
These tears of ours are justified

Beggin' ya to save me, hey Lord, somebody save me

Those who love always give the most
We're cryin' together from coast to coast
'Cause love leaves us cold and hurt inside
These tears of ours are justified
You never said you needed me
You abused my love, so set me free
You didn't need me, you didn't even want me
Somebody help me, this man wants to taunt me
You might also like
Calling the Caped Crusader, Green Hornet, Batman, Kato, too, anybody
I'm in so much trouble, I don't know what to do, yeah
If you think anything about me
If you love me at all
If you love me at all
Please now, please now
Please now, please now
I said save me, wow
Hey, hey, hey, save, me
Save-save-save-save save me
Save-save-save-save save meEmbed
