Happy birthday, happy birthday
Happy birthday, happy birthday
Happy birthday, happy birthday

Happy, happy birthday in a hot bath to those nice, nice nights
I remember always, always, I got such a fright
Seeing them in my dark cupboard with my great big cake

If they were me, if they were me
And I was you, and I was you
If they were me, if they were me
And I was you, and I was you
If they were me and I was you
Would you've liked a present too?

Happy, happy birthday in a hot bath to those nice, nice nights
I remember always, always, I got such a fright
Seeing them in my dark cupboard with my great big cake

If they were me, if they were me
And I was you and I was you
If they were me, if they were me
And I was you and I was you
If they were me and I was you
Would you've liked a present too?

Happy birthday, happy birthday
Happy birthday, happy birthday
Happy birthday, happy birthday
Happy birthday, happy birthday
Happy birthday, happy birthdayEmbed
