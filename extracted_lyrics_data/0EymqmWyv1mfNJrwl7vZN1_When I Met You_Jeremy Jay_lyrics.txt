1 ContributorHow Bout Now (Don’t Save Her) LyricsHow bout now, How bout now
How bout now
What about now
How bout now, how bout now
How bout now
Cause I'm up right now now
And you suck right now
How bout now, how bout now
What about now
How bout now, how bout now
How bout now, how bout now
What about now , how bout now
Cause I'm up right now now and you suck right now
When I first met you
Damn I  thought that you was special
Almost lost my mental
To a chick that was mental
Damn it girl I love you but I’d be stupid to trust you
Snakes in my circle you Eve baby they want you
And you is down to listen never could see the vision
Always say that I’m cheating but you was the one out creeping
No tender love and care the way you was out here scheming
Out here selling dreams but on me girl you sleeping
Karma is alive like Vader you hear the breathing
Always said we twins but that talks "Deceiving"
Girl you on a mission to do mе like Scottie Pippen
Girl I seen thе future I’m Jay HOV with pimping
Young HOV with spitting
J HOV my witnesses
You reap what you sow So right now don’t play victim
Turn good men into dogs
I wonder who did you wrong
Cause you out here selling dreams
'Almost slipped' is my song
Maybe it’s just for fun but when it 'all falls down'
Girl you looking dumb and we Shining like the sun
I gave it all to you really could have been wife
But you let them lames gas you got caught up in the hype
Don’t save her she don’t wanna be saved
I can see the hurt I don’t wanna be Jay
I’m balling out of control put it on a replay
I had to watch my love for you wither  and decay on god
You might also likeHow bout now how bout now
What about now
Cause I'm up right now and you suck right now
Now
How bout now
How bout now, how bout now
Cause I'm up right now and you suck right now
Don't save her she don't want to be saved
Don't save her don't save her
That girl for the streets she don't want to be saved
Don't save her she don't want to be saved
Don't save her don't save her
That girl for the streets she don't want to be saved
You could never see the vision I tell you about my business
You rather get drunk and throw all the dirty dishes
You brush it off for clubbing
Drinking dancing you love it
So many sides you afraid to be seen out in public
I know you felt something maybe you felt nothing
Had the Continental jumping down In La we fussing
At T house we laughing, Beer Festival macking
In me awoke passions I was digging yo fashion
You a soul child a hippie forming attachments
Sign the contract in 2020 back at it
Hammering Jack rabbit
That Bobby Whitney crack addicts
Your loving I had to have it
Them other hitters was practice
Cause I could never hate you
Just wanted to let you know you hurt me
Pissed me off you irked me
Gave me the herkie jerky
When it should been Slurpee Slurpee's
Shoulda retired my Jersey
King like James but I don't think you Worthy
So scriptures flow from Trinidad
Gold chains  feeling Earthly
I know I violated and I got some  toxic traits
But so do you we just spewing that  toxic waste
Had to flee before I pulled a Juice and catch a case
I ain’t gone lie no chick ever got me that mad
Or had me that glad that glad that bagged
I wanna say like Drake you the 'best I ever had'
But when I look back it endedjust  like 'back to back' on god
How bout now how bout now
What about now
Cause I'm up right now and you suck right now
Now
How bout now
How bout now, how bout now
Cause I'm up right now and you suck right now
Don't save her she don't want to be saved
Don't save her don't save her
That girl for the streets she don't want to be saved
Don't save her she don't want to be saved
Don't save her don't save her
That girl for the streets she don't want to be savedEmbed
