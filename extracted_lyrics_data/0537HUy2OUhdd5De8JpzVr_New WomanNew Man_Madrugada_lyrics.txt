4 ContributorsNew Woman/New Man Lyrics
She hits me like a jetstream
Burning everything, sets a torch to my bone dry soul
And all that once laid dead and cold
Now swings and rolls
And the cartwheels and the cartwheels and the windmills knock them down
I don't want no one else around
Just want to play around with this new friend I found

I want her over me
I want her alone with me
I want her to see all of me
A homeless child screams at me
Oh this is who I am
Old woman
New woman, new man

Well, it happened once again
The same thing that happened time and time again
And I should look the other way
But my eyes they just want to stare
Her hips and thighs and eyes
And yellow, shiny hair
She is the feature and the promised land
Just a new woman
New woman, new man
You might also like

I think of her against me
How we wrestle in white sheets
Her body calling out to me on broad, wide winter streets

I've seen her eyes, I've seen her face
Now I won't sleep with no one else
A woman ripe against my hand
And any old fool will understand
New woman, new man

New woman, new manEmbed
