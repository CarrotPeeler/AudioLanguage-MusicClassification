1 ContributorThis Will Remain Unspoken LyricsI find it hard to find the simple way
When the simple way
Is an ocean
I find it hard to justify these days
When all our days
Are a token
I hope you hear the things I need to say
As they will remain
Unspoken
So read my mind
It's crying out for love, to find
This is the start for me
As the end for me
Is not over
And everyday's a little more to see
A little more to be
When its over
So read my mind
It's crying out for love, to find
