2 ContributorsHead Down LyricsLovesick, lost and cold and lonely
With a gutful of nothing
And I’m long since past my limit
By my fuse is just a string
Friend you’ve shown me ever lonely
Trapped and pinned beneath your wing;
Fear that takes the heart and shakes
And now has left its hooks in me
Lay my head down
Breathe the dream the darkness on its way -
But I’m not afraid
Put my head down
Just believe the scars were worth the pain
'Cause I’m not afraid
Life and love and ever after
All I’d say and all I’d sing;
Wash it down and starve it back
To sleep tonight and not to dream
Death and taxes forth and back
We go from sin to deadly sin
And I don’t know what the attraction is
But I don’t see an end
Lay my head down
Breathe the dream the darkness on its way -
But I’m not afraid
Put my head down
Just believe the scars were worth the pain
Cause I’m not afraid
You might also likeLay my head down
Breathe the dream the darkness on its way -
But I’m not afraid
Put my head down
Just believe the scars were worth the pain
Cause I’m not afraid
Lay my head down
Breathe the dream the darkness on its way -
But I’m not afraid
Put my head down
Just believe the scars were worth the pain
Cause I’m not afraidEmbed
