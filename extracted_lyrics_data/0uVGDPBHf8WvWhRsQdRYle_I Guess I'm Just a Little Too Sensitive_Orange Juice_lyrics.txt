Until the day it hit me like a kick in the teeth
In the sensitivity stakes you're less than a non-starter
You don't need a lover you need a sparring partner
I guess I'm just a little too sensitive
Guess I'm just a little too sensitive
Guess I'm just a little too sensitive
For you
When you say your love is as bold as a flag
I say all I've got to show's a tattered rag
I guess I'll never learn to take the rough with the smooth
I'll never learn to live with that much abuse
Cause I guess I'm just a little too sensitive
Guess I'm just a little too sensitive
Guess I'm just a little too sensitive
For you
(Sensitive)
I come home from work each evening (just a little)
To collapse in a heap at your knees (a little bit, too sensitive)
Now I'm gonna take a rest cure (just a little, sensitive)
I'll rent a cottage by the sea (a little bit, too sensitive)

Guess I'm just a little too sensitive
Guess I'm just a little too sensitive
For you
A little bit, too sensitive
A little bit, too sensitive
For you
Too sensitive
A little bit, too sensitive
For you
Too sensitive
A little bit, too sensitive
Too sensitive
For you
A little bit, too sensitive
Too sensitive
For you
A little bit, too sensitive
A little bit, sensitive
A little bit, too sensitive
A little bit, sensitive
A little bit, too sensitive
A little bit, sensitive
A little bit, too sensitive
