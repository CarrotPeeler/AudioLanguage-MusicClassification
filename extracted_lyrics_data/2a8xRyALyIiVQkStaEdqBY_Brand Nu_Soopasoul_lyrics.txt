I want surprises
Your sweet nature darling was too hard to swallow
I've got the solution I'm leaving tomorrow
And now as I stand and stare into your eyes
I see safety there I want surprises
What I really need to do is
Find myself a brand new lover
Somebody real nice to me who
Doesn't notice all the others
What I really need to do is
Find a brand new lover
When you wake up tomorrow you'll be all alone
All the love that we had I have quickly outgrown
I wanted to stay but I just couldn't do it
Couldn't stand there and put you through it
What I really need to do is
Find myself a brand new lover
Somebody real nice to me who
Doesn't notice all the others
What I really need to do is
Find myself a brand new lover
Somebody real nice to me who
Doesn't notice all the others
My other loves will tell you that
I'm nothing but a pleasure-seeker
Everyone's I really must agree
I need to leave you by yourself
And go in search of someone else
To satisfy my curiosity
Your sweet nature darling
Was too hard to swallow
I've made my decision
I'm leaving tomorrow
I want surprises
What I really need to do is
Find myself a brand new lover
Somebody real nice to me who
Doesn't notice all the others
What I really need to do is
Find myself a brand new lover
Somebody real nice to me who
Doesn't notice all the others
What I really need to do is
Find myself a brand new lover
Your sweet nature darling
Was too hard to swallowYou might also likeEmbed
