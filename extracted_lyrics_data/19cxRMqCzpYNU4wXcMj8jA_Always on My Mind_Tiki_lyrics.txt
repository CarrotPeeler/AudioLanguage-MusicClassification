5 ContributorsAlways On My Mind Lyrics
Yeah
You're always on my mind, girl
Don't you know that you're always--

I remember when
When I first met you
I knew just what to do
I had to get to know
To get to know you right
Through the darkness, you're my light
You're always on my mind
Now the wait is all gone
For you, I wrote this song, girl
You don't know what you've got
Until your world has gone
This is why our love is strong

And girl you got me singing with some melody
You're always on my mind, this is what you do to me
Girl, you got me singing with some harmony
Forever you're my queen
And baby girl I'm your king, yeah
You might also like
I am not afraid, afraid to say the words
Even if my brothers heard
Because of what you made
And what you mean to me
You have given everything
You have changed my life
More than you'll ever know
This is why I have to show, girl
That you are everything
And everything to me
Baby girl, I hope you'll see

And girl you got me singing with some melody
You're always on my mind, this is what you do to me
Girl, you got me singing with some harmony
Forever you're my queen
And baby girl I'm your king, yeah

You're always on my mind, girl
Oh don't you know that you're always
You're always on my mind, girl
Yeah, you're always on my mind, girl
Don't you know that you're always
You're always on my mind, girl
Yeah1Embed
