You walked with a limp
And I was worried about that
But it turned out alright
Turned out that you were okay

And they pulled the car up
They helped you to the ground
Never met anyone like you
That wasn't always so fucked up and blue

And I know
I know that I can feel that way too
I won't get so bleak and I won't feel so through
And I know that I can feel that way too
Already know what it's like to feel so through
To feel so through
Now I just gotta figure out how not to

But can't you just come down
Can't you just come down
Can't you just come, can't you just come down
You might also like
The three of us left
I was trailing behind
With it all set up like
You know I never thought I'd see you again

You can find me in the corner or in the back
Under any sort of red light
But I can make it outside
You know I can make it there all right

And I know
I know that I can feel that way too
I won't get so bleak and I won't feel so through
And I know that I can feel that way too
Already know what it's like to feel so through
Feel so through
Now I just gotta figure out how not to

But can't you just come down
Can't you just come down
Can't you just come down
Can't you just come, can't you just come down
Come downEmbed
