10 ContributorsNever Dead Lyrics

Killers lie in wait for innocent blood
To swallow alive some harmless souls
Walking a crooked path, their wicked names will rot

Evil lives in the dark (its right is doing wrong)
The torment never ends (it never ends)

The fire that burns inside
That's blistering their brains
That makes them sacrifice
That's driving them insane
Trapped in this "no man's land"
Where angels dare to tread
Forever banned
To the realms of the Never Dead

There's no one you can trust from this grave
Die with those they swear to defend
Feeding on the ones they'll feed off in the end
You might also like
Evil lives in the dark (its right is doing wrong)
The torment never ends (it never ends)

The fire that burns inside
That's blistering their brains
That makes them sacrifice
That's driving them insane
Trapped in this "no man's land"
Where angels dare to tread
Forever banned
To the realms of the Never Dead

Death sits before you
To press on is suicide
Life spills out of your body
You wither and die
For the rest of your life
In the realms of the Never Dead

The fire that burns inside
That's blistering their brains
That makes them sacrifice
That's driving them insane
Trapped in this "no man's land"
Where angels dare to tread
Forever banned to the realms
Forever banned
To the realms of the Never DeadEmbed
