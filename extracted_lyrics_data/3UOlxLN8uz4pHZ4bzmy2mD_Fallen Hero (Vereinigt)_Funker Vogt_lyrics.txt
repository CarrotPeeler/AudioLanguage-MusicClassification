1 ContributorFallen Hero (Vereinigt) LyricsThey called me the tragic hero
They avoided my company
My names were only whispered
Just a tale for a moonless night
Fallen hero fits much better
To describe my true fate
Once a fighter for the light
Reduced to an observer
And again I hear the voices
A distant thunder through the night
The angel of destruction
Summoning her fellows for the fight
Now the time has come and yet you stand alone
The enemy is mighty and too strong
Without any help you will lose on your own
So you call out for me to come along
Now this can turn my fate
Revive my true confession
To be a fighter once again
Standing here by your side
This might be my last mission
The final fight for mankind
Reunited on the eve of the apocalypse
You might also likeAnd again I hear the voices
A distant thunder through the night
The angel of destruction
Summoning her fellows for the fightEmbed
