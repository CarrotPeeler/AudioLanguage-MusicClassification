3 Contributors.44 Pistol Lyrics
Well I wore my .44 so long
That it made my shoulder sore
Well I wore my .44 so long
That it made my shoulder sore

The woman I'm loving by the morning was no more

Got up so mad this morning
I don't know where in the world to go
Got up so mad this morning
I don't know where in the world to go

The woman I'm loving by the morning was no moreYou might also likeEmbed
