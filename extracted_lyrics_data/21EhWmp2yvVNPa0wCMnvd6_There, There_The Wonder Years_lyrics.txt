24 ContributorsThere, There Lyrics
You're just trying to read
But I'm always standing in your light
You're just trying to sleep
But I always wake you up to apologize

I'm sorry I don't laugh at the right times

I know how it seems
When I always sing to myself in public
I babble on like a mad man
I know how it seems
When I'm always staring off into nothing
I'm lost in my head again

I'm sorry I don't laugh at the right times
Is this what it feels like?

I've got my heart strung up on clothing line
Through tenement windows, in mid-July
I've got my heart strung up on clothing line
Through tenement windows
You might also like
I'm sorry I don't laugh at the right times
Is this what it feels like, with my wings clipped?
I'm awkward, and nervous
I'm awkward and nervous5Embed
