3 ContributorsGo On Without You Lyrics
Before you left me
I had it all
You were with me
And that was enough
He came along
And I forgot all about you
I was a fool
But I'm wiser now

Because you left
My world came to an end
(I tell you my world came to an end)
Then you came back again
(Then you brought it all together again)
Now I know
(Ooh)
There is no (There's no way) way
(There's no way)
I can go on without you
(I can go on without you)
You

A precious love
You took from me
Opened my eyes
And now I can see
A one night affair
Can be so unfair
But I paid the price
So I'm wiser now
You might also like
Because you left
My world came to an end
(My world came to an end)
Then you came back again
(And then you brought it back together again)
Now I know
(Ooh)
There is no (There's no way) way
(No way)
I can go on without you
(That I can go on, that I can go on without you, baby)
You
Because you left
My world came to an end
(My world came to an end)
Then you came back again
(Then you brought it, brought it all together again)
Now I know
(Right now I know)
There is no (There's no way) way
(No, no, no, no, no way)
I can go on without you
(I can go on without you)
You
Never again
Will I let you go
Now that you're home
I missed you so
Mhm, I love you forever
'Cause you've earned my love
And I just wanna say it's because of you
I'm wiser now

Because you left
(Because you left)
My world came to an end
(You see, my world came to an end)
Then you came back (Nobody but you) again
(Oh, you came back again)
Now I know
(I want the whole world to know)
There is no (You see, there's no way) way
(No-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no way)
I can go on
(I can't make it without you)
You left
(Oh, oh, ho)
My world came to an end
(Came to an end)
Then you came back again
(Then, oh, then you came back again)
Now I know
(You see, I know)
There is no (There's no way) way
(No-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no way)
I can go on with you
(I can go on without you, you)
I can't go on without you1Embed
