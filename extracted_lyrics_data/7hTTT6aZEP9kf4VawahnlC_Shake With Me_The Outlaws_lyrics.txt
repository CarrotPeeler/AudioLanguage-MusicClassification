1 ContributorWest Of California LyricsI hear there’s a place where promises don’t break
And the ground won’t shake you off your feet
I been longing for a town
Where the outlaws hang around
Where The lost go to get found and free
Come ride with me
CHORUS
On some hidden highway
Out there on the ocean
Where your give up just keeps goin
And your too lates right on time
Where the fast slows down
And the Past all stays behind you
Where that lonesome road runs out loneliness
Just wеst of California
I bet we find a bar
Wherе We can just be
Who we are
And they wave when you walk in
And the whiskey don’t run out
A little place to call our own to finally park this rolling stone
Right where we belong
Sure feels good getting gone

Won’t you ride with me
