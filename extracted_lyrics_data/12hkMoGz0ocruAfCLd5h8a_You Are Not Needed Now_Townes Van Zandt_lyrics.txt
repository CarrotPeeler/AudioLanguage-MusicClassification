7 ContributorsYou Are Not Needed Now Lyrics
Well, the birds were talking all at once
And the old man mowing down his lawn
He didn't look like much too bad a guy
And I was thinking, hang on, man, something's wrong
Your blues, they do seem to be gone
Heaven ain't bad, but you don't get nothing done

Lay down your head awhile
You are not needed now
You are not needed now

Well, Allison laid an egg on me
And every time I turn around
It's swimming through the air above my bed
I told Miss Hicks and she said, "Fine
As long as you're back in your room on time
I'll keep you clean and the girls will keep you fed"

Lay down your head with mine
You are not needed now
Ah and we got things to do
You might also like
Well, between the blankets made of wool
The trains go by every half an hour
And a body can't get no resting done, it's true
So I spend my time as best I can
Thinking big and making plans
And wondering where them trains are rolling to

Lay down your head, poor boy
Feel how the ground does move
Hear how them drivers sing

Well, goodbye, friends, it's time to close
Everybody knows that's the way it goes
Where was it you lived in case I'm ever there?
Well, three doors down and two behind
And it gets a little bit out of hand sometimes
Don't let it fool you into thinking you don't care

Lay down your head and fly
And I'll quietly pass you by
You won't even see me go
Well, if I thought about it long enough
I just might make some kind of move
Watchful eyes are too hard on the soul
With the smokehouse just across the way
And this fog upon the light of day
I'd be hard put coming up with where to go

Lay down your head, poor boy
And feel how the ground does move
Hear how them drivers sing

And what now, my darling one?
Go find a little fun
You are not needed nowEmbed
