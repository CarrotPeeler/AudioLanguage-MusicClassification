2 ContributorsEmergency House Party LyricsIt's been a long time coming
Trying to get our fun in
Working hard and almost done in
But tonight, we're gonna make it happen
We only need a song to dance to
We only need a chorus to sing along to
Pabst tall boys and all of our friends
And everything will be alright if only for tonight
If only for tonight
Drink and dance and sing along
Everything will be alright
If only for tonight
Well, it's been cold and dreary
And you've been sad and lonely
Why the fuck have you not phoned me?
Grab your stuff, we're getting shitty
We only need a song to dance to
We only need a chorus to sing along to
Pabst tall boys and all of our friends
And everything will be alright if only for tonight
If only for tonight
Drink and dance and sing along
Everything will be alright
If only for tonight
You might also likeDrink and dance and sing along
Drink and dance and sing along
Drink and dance and sing along
Everything will be alright, if only for tonightEmbed
