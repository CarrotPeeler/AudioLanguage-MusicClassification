3 ContributorsSon Of The Morning LyricsThere's no doubt he's back in town
Can't you feel he's sneakin' around again
The shepherd of all guilt that brought us
To the verge of a massive meltdown
Meltdown
Are we all too blind to see
He's around again round again
We're falling deeper into sin
Here he comes again comes again
In the absence of light he took over our lives
Trying to make us belive he doesn't exist
Another crash the black box not found
We're on the verge of a massive meltdown
Meltdown
Are we all too blind to see
He's around again round again
We're falling deeper into sin
Here he comes again comes again
(you'd better be ready)
(you'd better be ready)
(you'd better be.........ready)
Stop believing he doesn't exist
We'll hit rock bottom
This is the downfall
Another crash the black box not found
We'll hit rock bottom
This is the downfall

He does it like judas did
Not brave enough to take the sword
Look what we have become
He has got us on our balls
This is the massive meltdown
Meltdown meltdown
Meltdown
(he does it with a kiss)
Are we all too blind to see
He's around again round again
We're falling deeper into sin
Here he comes again comes again
Are we all too blind to see
He's around again round again
We're falling deeper into sin
Here he comes again comes again
(you'd better be ready)
(you'd better be)
(you'd better be ready)
