1 ContributorPostcard From California LyricsDear Pete
Don't know if you got my letter, but I think it explained everything alright. Sorry again about running out on the rent and pawning the TV and your folks' wedding rings. I woke up the other night in the backseat of my uncle's car somewhere in California and I swear I was shaken from a nightmare. Your dad was in it and he had a gun in my mouth and he was about ready to throw me out of a window, so I guess I got everyone pretty damn pissed at me, both living and dead
Sorry again
Your friend WalterYou might also likeEmbed
