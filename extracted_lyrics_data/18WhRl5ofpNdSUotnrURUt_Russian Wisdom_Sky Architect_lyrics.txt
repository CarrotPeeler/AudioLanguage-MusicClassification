1 ContributorRussian Wisdom LyricsGreen olives are closing in on me
It’s a Sunday at a party in a morgue
Some russian died, I don’t care
Chance is I don’t want to dare
To take that last green olive
Meteors will light the sky
Heavens will fall oh my
Please don’t tell me I’m just scared
Russians all around
You’ll have to take a chance
Because you lost a game
Of wisdom
The universe will stop
Little things will fall at once
Because you lost a game
Against your gods
Everyday I see that pretty bird
I carry
A photograph as a talisman
The old owl is russian wisdom
Even as he is as old as I am
Always speaking to my imagination
They’re having their talkshows
About the weather and about
How I’m gonna die tomorrow
Everywhere I look
I notice the presence of his act
Inspecting, judging
Making me go back
Is it just a conspiracy
Or a lie against my pain
Everlasting superstition
Russians

You’ll have to take a chance
Because you lost a game
Of wisdom
The universe will stop
Little things will fall at once
Because you lost a game
Against your godsEmbed
