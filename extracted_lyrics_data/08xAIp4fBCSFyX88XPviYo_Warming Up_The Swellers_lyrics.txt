It's dependency every second you're asleep
This bitter night is just a dream
So I'll sleep it off
Will I wake up if I sleep it off
And I wanted to see it coming true
And I wanted to see it
Every day I find a way to make you wait for me
It feels better in the heat
You said, just go inside
It's good to think while you're warming up
I'll still be here when you're warm enough
And I wanted to see it coming true
And I wanted to see things like you do
And I wanted to see it coming true
Cause I'll never be me without you
You're good for me
Yeah, you're good for me
You're good for me
Yeah, you're good for me
You're good for me
You're good for me
You're good for me
You're good for me
And I wanted to see it coming true
And I wanted to see things like you do
And I wanted to see it coming true
Cause I'll never be me without you
No, I'll never be me without youYou might also likeEmbed
