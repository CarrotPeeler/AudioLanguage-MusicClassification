1 ContributorThe End LyricsWaiting for Silence
Waiting for the night
Where is my heaven?
Suddenly there's a light
I wake from a nightmare
Every night's the same
A garden of pleasures
I see my soul in flames
Searching for silence
Searching for the night
Dreams of salvation
I'm determined to give up
I pray for an answer
Every night's the same
A tear for my memories
My life is passing by
In silent moments, lost in dreams
So tired of this endless pain
Where is my sun, where is the light?
A stranger is always by me side
He kills my heart, my inner flame
Is this the end? I wanna die
I hear the angels call my name
I spread my wings and try to flyYou might also likeEmbed
