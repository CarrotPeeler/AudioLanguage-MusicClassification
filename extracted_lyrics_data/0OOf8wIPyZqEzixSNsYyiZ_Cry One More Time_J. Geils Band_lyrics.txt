I really got it bad
Cry one more time for you
I lost the best I had
Everything's gone all wrong
I need another beer
She's got her mind on leavin' me
That's what I'm doin' here
Ain't no sense in talkin'
I don't know what I'd say
Ain't no sense in trying
She just don't wanna stay
Cry one more time for you
I really got it bad
Cry one more time for you
I lost the best I had
I tried to call her last night
I knew she wasn't in
I don't want to go around town
I know she'll be with him
So sad to be alone at night
So sad it didn't work out right

I really got it bad
Cry one more time for you
I lost the best I had
I lost the best I had, I lost the best I had
I lost the best I had, I lost the best I hadEmbed
