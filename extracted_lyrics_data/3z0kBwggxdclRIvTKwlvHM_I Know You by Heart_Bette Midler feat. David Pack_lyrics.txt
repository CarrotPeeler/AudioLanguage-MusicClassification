4 ContributorsI Know You by Heart Lyrics
Everybody wants to find a love
Somebody, somebody who will always care
But we get locked up in our own worlds
With feelings and secrets we're afraid to share

But all I have to do is see you smile
Or maybe, just maybe if I brush your hand
Something happens I cannot explain
And somehow, oh, somehow I can understand

I, I think you're gonna find (I'm gonna find you)
I'm gonna find you (I really don't know how), oh

I know you by heart
You're so much a part of me
I know you by heart
Can't you see?

It's no wonder I can love you the way that I do
I can finish any sentence you start
Woah, I know you, I know you by heart
You might also like
I know every time you're gonna call
I pick up the phone before it ever rings
And when you need some lovin', I'll be there
Beside you, anticipating everything

Oh, it's like I always said (You're the one I want)
And all I want is you (I'm the one, I'm inside your head)

I know you by heart
You're so much a part of me
I know you by heart
Can't you see?

It's no wonder I can love you the way that I do
I can finish any sentence you start (Hey, woah)
I know you by heart (I know you by heart)

So much a part of me
It's no wonder I love you the way that I do
I can finish any sentence you start
I know you, I know you by heart
I know you by heart
So much a part of me
I know you by heart
So much a part of me
I know you by heart
So much a part of me (So much a part of me)
I know you by heart

Yeah, I know you by heart
You're so much a part of me (So much a part of me)
I know you by heart (You're so much a part of me)
I know you by heartEmbed
