5 ContributorsGabby Mid’s First Day at Camp Boneyard Lyrics
Oh my god
I feel something changing
I really think I do
I know something feels different
It kinda feels great
Is this the circle of life? (Yea-)
Yeah?
I fell in love with a pessimist

Welcome to the plant cell bath. (Check it up-)
I've been plotting, a giant revenge scheme, I've been working
Way too much, I'm starting to see things
I'm planning a trip to New Mexico
Something is telling me to get up and go
I've been making all kinds of crazy moves
Like all these connections, my network is trough the roof
But I want something more, I wanna be fucking real
You can't get everything you want from one record deal

We turn up, yeah we do it for fun
All these kids on computers know how to have fun
Design Americana, yeah that's how we gon' run
Because a bunch of fucking kids are gonna get this shit done
You might also like
Yellow level thinking
That's what Randy told me, we gotta
Put the work and make the effort to see
He said we're all connected and I'm thinking it's true
But if I ain't got a platform, it ain't got nothing to use
The orange level plan, that's what Devon's all about, she was on a scheme when she figured it out
Well, it must become that temple, the plant cell bath

We turn up, yeah we do it for fun
All these kids on computers know how to have fun
Design Americana, yeah that's how we gon' run
Because a bunch of fucking kids are gonna get this shit done
We did this, yeah we did it ourselves
Nobody's really sure whether it's heaven or hell
Design Americana, put that book on the shelf
'Cause what we made is history, needs someone to tell
(Design Americana)
(Design Americana)
(Come on now, dog)
(Design Americana)
(Design Americana)
(Come on now, dog)
(I can't focus on both, there's two of them, there's one over here, and there's one right here)

(Ahem, get outta the car, get off the phone)
(You better look at what's coming to you baby, you better look right now!)
(It's almost like, it's the new rock music, or something like that, yeah)
Who am I?
Unproductive conversations
We're gonna die
So where's your hesitation?
(You don't do shit, you never do anything with your fucking life)

So when the coins turn up and your lighter runs out
You better make the right choice like you like yourself
Gonna clean up, I think you'll like me less
Shoulda known better, started smokin' cigarettes

And here we are again
Pretendin' that we're nothin' but friends
And it's weird, but tonight
You're only here for the night
You're only here for the night
You're only here for the night
A big night for the boys to come out
A block away and you're hearin' him shout
Your name, babe, it felt like a mile away
And you're scared because you think the boy is gonna come out
So you call me and we talk about a rock at the couch
I comment on your posture and your shoulders are slouched
You told me that you think you're losin' half of your mind
I tell you get the fuck out of the city in time

So when the coins turn up and your lighter runs out
You better make the right choice like you like yourself
Gonna clean up, I think you'll like me less
Shoulda known better, started smokin' cigarettes

And here we are again
Pretendin' that we're nothin' but friends
And it's weird, but tonight
You're only here for the night
You're only here for the night
You're only here for the night
And here we are again
Pretendin' that we're nothin' but friends
And it's weird, but tonight
You're only here for the night
You're only here for the night
You're only here for the n—

(Happy Valentines Day, man! Just wanted to know that you're the love of my life!)
(Oh for real?)
(This is the Farnsworth House, designed by Mies van der Rohe in 1945)

Babe, you're stuck in your head
And since the party last week, you're going off of the grid
I been grinning my teeth and you been dodging my calls
Just tell me what you regret

I have a theory that the purpose of life is when you feel really weird and you don't know why
I have a theory that God is playing some kind of massive joke on us, it sucks
What's in it for the rest of us?
I said, what's in it for the rest of us?
What's in it for the rest of us? (Yeah)
What do you believe in?
I think I'll never stop
The perfect kind of prison
Where time's cut in a knot

Babe, you're stuck in your head
Since, the party last week, you're going off at the grid
I been grinning my teeth and you been dodging my calls
Just tell me what you regret

Just tell me what you regret
Is it getting kinda scary just to keep up the guess?
I know, I'm worried too
Are you getting kinda used to being used?
Flash forward two months and I'm outta here
I can't pickup on any single plot

Boys never give up
Boys never give up
Boys never give up

I'll love you, if you ain't got nobody to love
And I'll adore you, if there's no one to adore
And I'll show you, if there's no one to show
And I'll know you, if you want somebody to know

Every time you come around
You put a lightning bolt on my face
Baby, every time you come around
Girl, you take my breath away
And I just wanna breathe until I take you in
Cause I want you to breathe until you take me in
But the truth is

She has no idea, no idea
That I'm even here, I'm even here
She has no idea, no idea
I'm standing in here, I'm standing in here
I'm standing here
I'm standing in here!
I'm standing in here
I'm standing in here!
I'm standing in here

(It's just good music, that's all
You don't do shit, you never do anything with your fucking life)

Do you remember that night?
It was like 2018, those people got in a fight
Yeah, they were making a scene
The four of us were chilling, yeah, just passing the time
We were passing the blunt, like it's the
Circle of life (Enaturalist)
Seeing fractals
Losing touch over time
Somebody's gotta call them, I don't know
You're alright
Cause when your best friend is the love of your life
You gotta put the effort into CII

(Check it up)
(Check it up)
(Check it up)
(Check it up)
(Check it up)
(Check it up)
(Check it up)
(Check it up)

You're all alone
I'm getting stoned
I'm waiting for packages at my door
I just moved in
You're on your phone
I think we both been asking for-

More than we should
I woke up in the woods
What if I never get what I want, what I want?
(Want, want.)

I can't believe I got sick of in this past
Are you dead or are you stoned?
Are you scared or do you know?
Come on just
Check it up, check it up
Check, it up, check it up

These are the type of thing we live up to-
My mama's gonna take away my-
If everything is easier, then what you think?
I swear to god
I see everything went better
We see everything in ways that-

More than we should
I woke up in the woods
What if I never get what I want, what I want?
(Want, want)

I can't believe I got sick of in this past
Are you dead or are you stoned?
Are you scared or do you know?
I think-

You're feeling weird about it
Too bad I'm falling in love with you
Will this shit never end?
Will I be here forever?


Until I panicked, I spent my life behind the screen
You made me worried, I could never be exactly like you
I couldn't stand it, packed up next to everything
Left in a hurry, never did nothing to cross, despite you

But then I found out about source
I fill my lungs out with choice
In my throat, I was sore
Standing my vocal chords
Are we in this together, or we just bored?

I'm here for you now
I'm here for you now
I'm here for you now (Don't start, don't fret)
I'm here for you now (Don't start, don't fret)

At some point, or another
I know you'll get back at me
Deteriorating my very own anatomy
And if I'm gonna tackle this shit independently
I think I may need to tap into a sense of unity
(Kay) Sense of unity
(Yeah)
Are you gonna give it your all?
I'm here for you now
I'm here for you now
I'm here for you now
I'm here for you now


Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, what's up?
We're spinning another one from your favorite Rainbow Bridge here at-
OFTK, it's in the mix

I saw your shinin' eyes and for the first time in ages, I felt relief
I haven't seen the sky and I've been traveling for weeks
I was guided by my best friend and I learned that he's the love of my life
But the mountain's insurmountable, good grief, I sure was living a lie

It's not even love, it's just all that I want
Seven new reasons to never change what I got
It's not even love, it's just all that I want
Seven new reasons to never change what I got

My path got blocked by my wrath for I envy the dead, because they got to sleep
I lie down with those strange officious avaricious, I need something to eat
Pride rocked, shell-shocked, well-stocked, Stockholm syndrome again
I'll see you in the clouds when this all comes to an end

It's not even love, it's just all that I want
Seven new reasons to never change what I got
It's not even love, it's just all that I want
Seven new reasons to never change what I got
It's not even love, it's just all that I want
Seven new reasons to never change what I got
It's not even love, it's just all that I want
Seven new reasons to never change what I got


Never have I ever, no I haven't and I bet I probably won't
(Oh)
Don't ask me how I'm doin', how I do it, chances are I probably don't (Ah yeah)
I let admiration get to my head
Fuck celebrities, I might as well just copy my friends
And if only I knew who it is they think that I am
Shed some confidence 'cause I don't wanna have to pretend
(Anymore)

Hey, I think I'm full of it
Hey, I must be full of it
Hey, I think I'm full of it
Hey, I must be full of it

So wait, who is Gabby Mid?
Yeah, I'm not really sure
I think today might be the first day, that we really got to know each otherEmbed
