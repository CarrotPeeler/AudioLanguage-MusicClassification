1 ContributorThat Lucky Old Sun LyricsUp in the morning out on my job work like a devil for my pay
And that lucky old sun ain't got nothing to do but roll around heaven all day
Fuss with my woman toil with my kids sweat till I'm wrinkled and gray
And that lucky old sun ain't got nothing to do but roll around heaven all day
Lord above can't you see I'm crying tears are in my eyes
Sending down my cloud with that silvery lining take me to paradise
Show me that river lead me across take all my troubles away
And that lucky old sun ain't got nothing to do but roll around heaven all dayYou might also likeEmbed
