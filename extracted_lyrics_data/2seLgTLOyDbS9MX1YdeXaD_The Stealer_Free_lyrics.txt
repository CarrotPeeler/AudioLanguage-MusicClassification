1 ContributorThe Stealer LyricsI went down to the center of the town
And my feet was a burnin' ground
She stood on the corner merrily as can be
I said, "Hey good lookin', won't you come with me?"
She said, "Yeah"
I'm the stealer
I'm the stealer
The sun was shining, the world was right
I said, "Tell me, baby, wha'cha doin' tonight?"
"I'm goin' 'round the corner where the music's loud
I'm tired of the city, won't you come on 'round?"
I said, "Yeah" Ah yeah
I'm the stealer, come to steal your love
Steal your lovе, oh yeah
"Goin' 'round the corner whеre the music's loud
I'm tired of the city, why don't you come on 'round?"
I said, "Yeah"
I'm the stealer, come to steal your love
Got to steal your love
Steal your love
Steal your love, baby, yeah yeah
I am going to steal your love away
I am going to steal your love away
Steal your love

Steal your love
Got to steal your love
Steal your love
Steal your love
