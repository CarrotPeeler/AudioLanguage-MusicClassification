2 ContributorsShoot First and Run Like Hell LyricsKick it
I don't know what I'm talking about so you better listen to me
All the way from Mobile, Alabama I'm the madman from Tennessee
And I'm so hungry and I'm still here
Like they said, fucked in my head
Let's get one thing clear
Shoot first and run like hell
Shoot first and run like hell, yeah!
Kick it
Moses came down from the mountain with two big blocks of stone
God forever said, "Fuck these things, I'll figure it out on my own"
Hey everybody, come gather 'round
It's a fact Jack, you're never talking back
Six feet underground
Shoot first and run like hell
Shoot first and run like hell, yeah!
