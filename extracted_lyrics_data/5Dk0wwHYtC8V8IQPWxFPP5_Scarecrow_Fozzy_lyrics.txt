Never thought I'd see this day
Tossed up pride into the fire
Nothing to keep the crows away
Scarecrow
Scarecrow
With the fields left all alone
The crows blackened out the skies
Claimed the farm as their own
Destroy the man they all despise
Oh scarecrow we need you back again
You been gone much too long and the world has gone bland
Oh scarecrow we need you to defend
Oh scarecrow we need you back again
The feeding frenzy is complete
The dirt stripped of all it's life
Hungry all the crows leave
Another farm to occupy
Oh scarecrow we need you back again
You been gone much too long and the world has gone bland
Oh scarecrow we need you to defend
Oh scarecrow we need you back again
