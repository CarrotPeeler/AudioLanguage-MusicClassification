All-embracing
Worldwide
Abolishing death
Playing god
Low-born docile
Amiss servile
If you can afford it there is no limit
If you can afford it there is no limit
Endlessly breeding
Freeze drying
Kind-hearted kind
Deserved to be preserved
Plain, obvious, clear
With us you'll be above the human
Beyond the human
You'll make history
Deceived, mislead, deluded
If you can afford it there is no limit
If you can afford it there is no limit
