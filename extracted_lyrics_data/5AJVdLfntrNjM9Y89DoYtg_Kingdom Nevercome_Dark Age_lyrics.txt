3 ContributorsKingdom Nevercome LyricsAn interfering link connects with the unstable
My scatterred eye is used to fake the worst
I am giving in to a plastic cash return
Working the daydream until my muscles burn
While falling through measures
It's sucking me in raising doubt
All sense bleeding empty
It's hard to begin
To break out
I am dying while tying
I am so close to get a life like all others
Fall back on regret
Will I ever be myself again
After bulding my kingdom nevercome
Watch a life collapse for things not to come
The helpless try to compensale this life
While falling through measures
It's sucking me in raising doubt
All sense bleeding empty
It's hard to begin
To break out
You might also likeI am dying while tying
I am so close to get a life like all others
Fall back on regret
Will I ever be myself again
After bulding my kingdom nevercome
The visonary lies to himself
Not to others
Not to others
Rise to ill
But whi has proven life to be alright?
I am dying while tying
I am so close to get a life like all others
Fall back on regret
Will I ever be myself again
After bulding my kingdom nevercomeEmbed
