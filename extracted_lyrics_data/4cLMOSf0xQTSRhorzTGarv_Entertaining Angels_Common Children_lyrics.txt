2 ContributorsEntertaining Angels LyricsIt's getting late in the evening (and I really don't mind at all)
And I'm grateful one more time
Wish I could freeze this feeling (before the stars burn out and fall)
Photograph this state of mind
Sometimes I know
We're entertaining angels
In all the letting go
We're entertaining angels
The world has almost turned now (and I really don't mind at all)
The first glimpse of morning light
Raise my hand to the sky now (before the stars burn out and fall)
Throw the past out with the night
Sometimes I know
We're entertaining angels
In all the letting go
We're entertaining angels
Sometimes I know (The stars will come out this evening)
We're entertaining angels (Let go of the fear inside)
In all the letting go (This love is the only reason)
We're entertaining angels (Raise your hands to the sky)
Entertaining angels (Raise your hands to the sky)
