2 ContributorsSo Many People Lyrics
Where do you want to go?
Are you sure of the road that you're on?
Who do you want to be?
All I know is the world deserves to be free
Let's pretend
We're staring from the moon
Love is not only for the human

Look at the world you know
Do you believe it will go on?
Where do you want to go?
The things we take will only last for so long
In the end
You know it's up to you
Love is not only for the human

Oh man, we are so many people
Living different lives under turbulent times
Oh man, we don't know good from evil
Looking through our eyes is the burden of our lives

Na na na na na

Say can we tell for sure
The North and South will keep their snow on?
Say can the Earth endure
Do you really believe we can go on?
In the end
You know it's up to you
Love is not only for the human

Oh man, we are so many people
Living different lives under turbulent times
Oh man, we don't know good from evil
Looking through our eyes is the burden of our lives

Ba ba ba ba

In the end God is the Universe
And the Universe is you

Oh man, we are so many people
Living different lives under turbulent times
Oh man, we don't know good from evil
Looking through our eyes is the burden of our livesEmbed
