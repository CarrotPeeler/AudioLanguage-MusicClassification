One, two, three, four"

Ooh, we're gettin' ready
Yeah, ready
Here we go
Ha ha-ha
Get ready
Ooh yeah

Ooh, we're gettin' ready to rock
We're gettin' ready to roll
I'm gonna turn up the heat
I'm gonna fire up the coal

I gotta keep that motor turnin'
I gotta keep that engine clean
I gotta keep those tires burnin'
I've got the best you've ever seen

And I'm a heatseeker
Chargin' up the sky
And I'm a heatseeker
And I, I don't need no life preserver
I don't need no one to hose me down
To hose me down
You might also like
Ooh, we're gettin' ready to break
Gettin' ready to go
Get your shoes off and shake
Get your head down and blow

You gotta keep that woman firin'
You gotta keep that circuit clean
You gotta make her sound the siren
You gotta hear that lady scream

'Cause I'm a heatseeker
Burnin' up the town
And I'm a heatseeker
And I don't, I don't need no life preserver
I don't need no one to hose me down
Don't hose me down
Aw, here it come
Yeah

Ready?
Heatseeker
I want to see you get up
And see the whites of your eyes

And I'm a heatseeker
(Heatseeker)

Yeah
I'm gonna measure you up
I'm gonna try you for size

And I'm a heatseeker

Gotta keep that motor turning
Ya gotta keep that engine clean
Ya gotta keep those tires burning
I've got the best you've ever seen

And I'm a heatseeker
And I don't need no life preserver
I don't need no one to hose me down
Whoa, I'm a heatseeker
And I'm a heatseeker
Heatseeker, whoa
Out on the street, feel the heat
Ow!2Embed
