3 ContributorsSaint Judas Lyrics
Saddle up the horses and wear your Sunday best
Sing your sacred harp, you'll be holier than the rest
Fill up the room with a grand and a thunderous song
Let it rattle out the windows, let it spill out on the lawn

As you shout, shout your praises to the man who kissed the lord
To the back-stabbing brother that betrayed all of this world
Your Judas!

Yea, you may walk in the valley in the dark
There's no greater evil than the darkness in your heart
Your sun gods, bloodhounds, needle, and your razor wire
Your nylon-shackle whipping post and your high-tech burning tire

Judas
Judas
Judas

Whiplash crack across the back, across the arms
Although you bound his feet, he running fast, he running hard
Through the crickets in the corn and them horses in the field
Hear the caw-caw of the crows, see the devil at the wheel, y'all
