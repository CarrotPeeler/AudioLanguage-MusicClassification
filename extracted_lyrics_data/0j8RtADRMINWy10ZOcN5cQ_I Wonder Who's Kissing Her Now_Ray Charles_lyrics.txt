4 ContributorsI Wonder Whoâ€™s Kissing Her Now Lyrics
I wonder who's kissing her now
I wonder who's teaching her how
I wonder who's looking into her eyes
Breathing sighs and telling lies

I wonder who's buying the wine
For lips that I used to call mine
I wonder if she ever tells him of me
I wonder who's kissing her now

I wonder who's buying the wine
For lips that I used to call mine
I wonder if she ever tells him of me
I wonder, I wonder
Pretty baby, how I wonder
I wonder who's kissing you nowYou might also likeEmbed
