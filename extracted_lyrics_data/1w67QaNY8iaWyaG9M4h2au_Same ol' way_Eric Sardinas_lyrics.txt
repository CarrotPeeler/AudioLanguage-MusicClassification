1 ContributorSame Olâ€™ Way LyricsI'm getting weary
I'm going blind
'Cause you mistreat me baby so unkind
One thing I know honey
Love is blind
'Cause you find your heart and then loose your mind
I keep crying the same old way
I keep on trying the same old way
Feels like I'm dying baby...
The same old way....yeah
Your kind of loving, Can't be found
You pick me up just to tear me down
But here I am baby, On my knees
Still trying to give you love and everything
I keep crying the same old way
I keep on trying the same old way
Feels like I'm dying baby...
The same old way....yeah
So you don't love me
Let me tell you that's no surprise
I see so clearly, I can see it's lost in your eyes
Your heart breaks coming, It's gunna cut you baby...down to size

Look Out!
The time has come I can't
Take no more
I got to leave this killing floor
You've done me dirty
You've done me wrong
It's been too hard baby, way to long
I keep crying the same old way
I keep on trying the same old way
Feels like I'm dying the same old way
Feels like I'm dying the same old way
Feels like I'm dying...
Oh baby, oh lord
Keep me crying baby
Keep me crying babe
Oh lord
Oh lord
Ohhhhh Oh baby
Can't take no more of this same old wayEmbed
