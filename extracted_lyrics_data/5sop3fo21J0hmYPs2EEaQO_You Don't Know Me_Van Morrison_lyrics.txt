3 ContributorsYou Donâ€™t Know Me Lyrics
You give your hand to me and then you say hello
And I can hardly speak, my heart is beating so
And anyone can tell
You think you know me well
You don't know me

Now you don't know one who longs for you each night
And longs to kiss your lips and longs to hold you tight
You know I'm just a friend
That's all I've ever been
You don't know me

I never knew the art of making love
'Til my heart yearns with love for you
Afraid and shy
I let my chance go by
The chance you might have loved me too

You give your hand to me and then you say goodbye
I watch you walk away beside some lucky guy
To never, never know
The one who loves you so
'Cause you don't know me
You might also like

I never knew, I never knew, I never knew
I never knew, I never knew
I never knew the art of making love
'Til my heart yearns with love for you
Afraid and shy
I let my chance go by
The chance you might have loved me too

You give your hand to me and then you say goodbye
(Then you said goodbye)
I watch you walk away beside some lucky guy
To never, never know
The one who loves you so
'Cause you don't know meEmbed
