1 ContributorKnock Me Out LyricsNothing I've said before makes any sense now
I love you
Nothing I've ever done, no one I've ever met
No one I've kissed matches up to you, no
I catch your eye in the rear-view mirror
With one hand on your chin
Stroking your cheek with one finger
How I wish you were mine
You knock me out, you knock me out
So I'll never have another
You knock me out, you knock me out
No I'll never have another lover
Hit me like a hurricane
Hit me like a bomb, bomb
Hit me like a hurricane
Hit me like a bomb, bomb
Nothing I've bought before has any worth now
I want you
No match I've ever won, no money I've ever bet
Nothing I've risked can thrill me like you do
I catch your eye in the rear-view mirror
With one hand on your chin
Stroking your cheek with one finger
God I wish you were mine
You might also likeYou knock me out, you knock me out
So I'll never have another
You knock me out, you knock me out
No I'll never have another lover
Hit me like a hurricane
Hit me like a bomb, bomb
Hit me like a hurricane
Hit me like a bomb, bomb
And our love has never been better
And our love won't fall apart
And our love has never been better
And I've loved you from the start
There's only you for me
Yeah, it's you
You knock me out, you knock me out
So I'll never have another
You knock me out, you knock me out
No I'll never have another lover
You knock me out, so I'll never have another
You knock me out, no I'll never have another loverEmbed
