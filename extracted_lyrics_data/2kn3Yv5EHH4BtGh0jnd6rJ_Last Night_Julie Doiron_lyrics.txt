2 ContributorsLast Night LyricsLast night, I held you in my arms and
I started to cry
And you looked up and squeezed your hands
Onto my head like you knew why
Today I fly across the ocean
I will be away 20 days
And I didn't know I would be like this
'cause I'd be away 20 days
Tomorrow, I'll be on a stage and
I will sing the words from all of the pages
I will close my eyes in front of all the people
I will close my eyes thinking of you
But, last night, I held you in my arms and
You might also likeI started to cry
And you looked up and squeezed your hand
Onto my head like you knew why
And it was so rightEmbed
