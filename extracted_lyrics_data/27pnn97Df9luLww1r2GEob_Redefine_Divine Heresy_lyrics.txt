The deep end is just too far for my reach
Eyes filled with dirt, buried in this shadow
Maybe someone will pull me out
Pull me out
Ripping its way inside of me
Tortured the shell that confines me
Is burning and redefining me
I try to be free away from this place
To rise above the ruins and take a breath
Sinking under the ocean of hatred
Can I swim to the surface?
Ripping its way inside of me
Tortured the shell that confines me
Is burning and redefining me
I will murder the negativity
Take back the strength that it's given to me now
I'm redefining it all
So long inside this place of solitude
I scratch the walls until my fingers are bleeding
The stains never seem to go away
No matter how much I rub, they stay the same
You might also likeFrail from all this place has given me
The cuts and the bruises burn like the blood stains
Crawling on the floor, slowly to the door
I try to open it up, but it seems too far
Ripping its way inside of me
Tortured, the shell that confines me
Is burning and redefining me
I will murder the negativity
Take back the strength that it's given to me now
I'm redefining it all
Take back the strength that it's given to me now
To redefine
Take back the strength that it's given to me now
