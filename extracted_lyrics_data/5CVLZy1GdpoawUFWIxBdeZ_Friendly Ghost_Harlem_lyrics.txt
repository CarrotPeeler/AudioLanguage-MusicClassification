4 ContributorsFriendly Ghost Lyrics
I live in a graveyard
I wanna go out, but it's too hot
Yeah, I'm just as see-through as Casper the Ghost
Oh, I hope you know I wanna get outta here
Help me get outta here

I can't stand it
I'm so possessive
The more you keep, the closer you get to love
The cops, who's business, double to exert
Who feels just, but I can't drop it
You cop it?
I wanna disappear all the time
Help me disappear
Tonight!

You're only happy when you win
You're whipping gold, we'll get all killed
Whatever happened to me?
Whatever happened to me making you happy?

I can't stand it
I'm so possessive
The more you keep the closer you get to love
The cops, who's business, double to exert
Who feels just, but I can't drop it
You cop it?
I wanna disappear all the time
Help me disappear
Tonight!

Did I do something bad?
'Cause you're in the worst mood I think you ever had
Did I do something wrong?
'Cause it's been a long long long time

I can't stand it
I'm so possessive
The more you keep the closer you get to love
The cops, who's business, double to exert
Who feels just, but I can't drop it
You cop it?
I wanna disappear all the timeEmbed
