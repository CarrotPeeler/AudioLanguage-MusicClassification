8 ContributorsHold On Lyrics
With aversion
This assertion came so swiftly
Cut the cord from
This day forward
We'll be drifting
No direction
No affection
Watch the soul dive
You're dissected
Resurrected
Still don't know why
This illness is like a monster that is
Eating us alive

Hold on! Be strong!
So right! So wrong!
With all of our senses!
All of our defenses!
Hold on! Be strong!

New arrival
Our survival
Still not certain
Once a virtue
Where to go to
When you're hurting
It's a weakness
It's a sickness
In the gene pool
Show no mercy
People here say
Kill the damn fool
This illness is
Like a monster that is
Eating us alive

Don't ever let me go, no!
Don't ever let me go, no!
And I'll never let you go, no!
I'll never let you go, no!

Hold on! Be strong!
So right! So wrong!
With all of our senses!
All of our defenses!
Hold on! Be strong!2Embed
