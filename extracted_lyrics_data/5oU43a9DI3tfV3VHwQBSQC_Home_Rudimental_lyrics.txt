Mama always said I’ll find my way back
Back home
So tell me why am I still lost in limbo
With nowhere to go

God knows I’m trying, I’m fighting to get out of here
Oh but sometimes it’s hard not to give into fear
I build myself up ‘cause I want it so much
I need to break free

Headed for somewhere else
‘Cause it’s a long way home
Courage to carry on
I’ve got to be oh so strong
‘Cause it’s a long way home

Mama always said I’ll find my way back
Back home
So tell me why am I still lost in limbo
With nowhere to go

God knows I’m trying, I’m fighting to get out of here
Oh but sometimes it’s hard not to give into fear
I build myself up ‘cause I want it so much
I need to break free

Headed for somewhere else
‘Cause it’s a long way home
Courage to carry on
I’ve got to be oh so strong
‘Cause it’s a long way home

I’m headed for somewhere else
I’m guessing the time will tell
‘Cause it’s a long way home
Courage to carry on
And now I got to be oh so strong
‘Cause it’s a long way home

Headed for somewhere else
‘Cause it’s a long way home
Courage to carry on
I’ve got to be oh so strong
‘Cause it’s a long way homeEmbed
