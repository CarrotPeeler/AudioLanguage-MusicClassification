Where do we go? (Where do we go?)
And all the people, they sure don't want you to know
They don't want you to know, oh-oh
Livin' in chains, thoughts rearrange
You got a worried mind, all of the time
Now tell me I'm right, oh-oh

And I got a thing I really can't say
Oh, oh, oh, oh

You've got a worried mind
I got a worried heart
You don't know what to do
I don't know where to start
You let this beat us down
Well get up off the ground
One day, I know we've got to go, oh

Where is your mind? (Where is your mind?)
The street is beatin' you down and taking its time
It's taken its time, oh-oh
Nowhere to run (Nowhere to run)
I told you to get, but you were havin' your fun
Now you're under the gun, oh-oh

And I got a thing I really can't say
Oh, oh, oh, oh

You've got a worried mind
I got a worried heart
You don't know what to do
I don't know where to start
You let this beat us down
Well get up off the ground
One day, I know we've got to go, oh-oh8Embed
