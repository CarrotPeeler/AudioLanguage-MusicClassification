My telephone rang one evening, my buddy called for me
Said the bankers are all leaving, you better come 'round and see
It's a startling revelation, they robbed the nation blind
They're all down at the station, no banker left behind

No banker, no banker, no banker could I find
They were all down at the station, no banker left behind

Well the bankers called a meeting to the White House they went one day
They was going to call on the President in a quiet and a sociable way
And the afternoon was sunny and the weather it was fine
They counted out our money and no banker was left behind

No banker, no banker, no banker could I find
They were all down at the White House, no banker was left behind


Well I hear the whistle blowing, it plays a happy tune
The conductor's calling all aboard, we'll be leaving soon
With champagne and shrimp cocktails and that's not all you'll find
There's a billion dollar bonus and no banker left behind

No banker, no banker, no banker could I find
When the train pulled out next morning, no banker was left behind
No banker, no banker, no banker could I find
When the train pulled out next morning, no banker was left behind
Hallelujah band


No banker, no banker, no banker could I find
They were all down at the station, no banker was left behind
No banker, no banker, no banker could I find
When the train pulled out next morning, no banker was left behind1Embed
