1 ContributorWalkinâ€™ Home LyricsCrowds on the sidewalk
Taxis on the street
Ol' man at the bus stop
Hope he finds a seat
Trucks on the turnpike
Freight trains on the track
I'm leavin' this mean ol' city
I won't be comin' back
I'm just walkin', walkin' home
I'm just walkin', walkin' home
Cane in the field
Crows on the wire
Woman by the roadside
Changin' a flat tyre
Sunrise on the bayou
Young boy fishin' in a catfish pond
Tugboats on the river
River's rollin' on
I'm just walkin', walkin' home
I'm just walkin', walkin' home

Didn't send a telegram
Couldn't pick up a telephone
Just wanna say, "Here I am"
I been walkin, walkin' home
Temperature's risin'
I got Fats on the box
With gravel in my shoes
An' sand in my socks
I'm just walkin', walkin' home
I'm just walkin', walkin' home
Comin' home
Walkin', I'm walkin' homeEmbed
