6 ContributorsAutumn Sun LyricsMy youth stood by the harbour
Her hands set in a wave
The light now more evening than day
Now I see the beauty I failed to see when she was me
Life undressed me of her, step by step
Like a silk dress, she fell to my feet
She brought me flowers
Said she liked my work
I thought she couldn't do us any harm
He never liked that kind of charm
But how could he resist
When her dress let in the autumn sun?
I used to watch the sparrows
Perched on electric wires
Like notes of a song waiting to be sung
For you, I wrote them down
He laughed that laugh that kept me sane
In a world of dark dark games
She brought me flowers
Said she liked my work
I thought she couldn't do us any harm
He never liked that kind of charm
But how could he resist
When her dress let in the autumn sun?

And played with the kids
For her birthday, let her try on
His wedding ring
She brought me flowers
Said she liked my work
I thought she couldn't do us any harm
He never liked that kind of charm
But how could he resist
When her dress let in the autumn sun?Embed
