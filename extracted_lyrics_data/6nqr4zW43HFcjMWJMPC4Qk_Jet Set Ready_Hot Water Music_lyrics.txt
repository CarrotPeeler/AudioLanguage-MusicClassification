2 ContributorsJet Set Ready Lyrics
So I ask myself are we too far gone
Because ever since we put our hands on the mill
We've been cutting strong
Blind to life
And the consequences of taking life

We're not jet set ready
We're sinking with the ship that we built too quickly
But we'll shift and re-shift the blame
To keep it off our conscience that we helped to build it

So long to the simple song the balanced one
That's long gone forgotten by more than some
Minds burned while young
Pioneers gone wrong
Who won't cease to live without oppressing life

And so long to the ways that we knew fit
With the world we lived in
We can generate enough wealth or power
We can take and take until we have it
All

We lived in gracious world a forgiving world
And show our thanks with industry open eyes can see
While open mouths can speak to change or rearrange
What should not fade
So long, so long
So long, so longEmbed
