1 ContributorAudaxious Lyrics
When I break through I will make you irrelevant
They will never forget me like an Elephant
Glowing like beams and it seems so evident
Don’t know my name yet? Soon it will be prevalent
Thought I was gone but you see I never went
I’m so blessed they say I’m heaven sent
And the call to my prayer they gave Seanen M
-magine writing all these hits with a John Lennon pen
I single-handedly
Give them goods, more than the economy
Orion
A prominent constellation, astronomy
Guess I’m made of a million stars
And I’m red hot shit I’ve been living on mars
And if I really am made of a million stars tell me
Where the fuck is my academy?
Oh stop, enough with the flattery
Torn like Natalie, fire hot anatomy
I need to recharge, battery
In this public mess I am dressed for the
Anarchy apparently I’m mad for the insanity
And someone set a cannon free, tragedy! calamity!
I wanna be the remedy better be my charity
And hopefully this melody’s a method for some clarity
S’appening B
You might also like
It’s an audaxious revolution quick!
I’ll show you the real definition of sick
It’s an audaxious revolution quick!
You know we’re your ear nutrition
So flirtatious, good gracious, patience
Outrageous, can’t change us, natures
Arranged us to deflate the nations knees
No fallacious, mordacious, too
Expiditious, fugacious, spacious
Contagious, it’s an audacious disease

Ergh, you make me vomit
Shh, silence Gromit
I’m running away, top speed like Sonic
Somebody better hand me a Gin and Tonic
Playing with spirits a board of ouija
Mario caught me with Princess Peach we
Banged on a beach, kinda looked like Fiji
Told me that I'm bigger than Luigi’s plunger
The pink power ranger
Put a spell on herrrr-mione Granger
Made her so high her life was in danger
I said to down this plane I’ll have to Nicholas Cage ya
But we fly through a million stars
One day I’ll be bigger than Kardashian’s Arse
Wonder if I’ll ever be as trashy and farce-like
Call my kid Saint and lay him down in a manger
It’s an audaxious revolution quick!
I’ll show you the real definition of sick
It’s an audaxious revolution quick!
You know we’re your ear nutrition
So flirtatious, good gracious, patience
Outrageous, can’t change us, natures
Arranged us to deflate the nations knees
Don't enrage us, predacious, may just
Need majors to cage us, dangerous
Courageous, can't tame us, at stations please

Mon-row the neuro flow I'll Marilyn your adrena
When I’m down I get right back up you can call that trial and error
Verified Lord of the atmosphere watch as I style the weather
Sinister mist this Mr. coming for the top on Insta and I’ll hear you say x2
(Who’s Kylie Jenner?)

It’s the audaxious revolution quick!
I’ll show you the real definition of sick
It’s the audaxious revolution quick!
You know we’re your ear nutrition
Don't enrage us, predacious, may just
Need majors to cage us, dangerous
Courageous, can't tame us, at stations please
No fallacious, mordacious, too
Expiditious, fugacious, spacious
Contagious, it’s an audacious diseaseEmbed
