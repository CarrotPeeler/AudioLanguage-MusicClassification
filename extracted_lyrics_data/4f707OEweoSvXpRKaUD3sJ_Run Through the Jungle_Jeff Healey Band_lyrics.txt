2 ContributorsRun Through The Jungle LyricsWell I Thought It Was A Nightmare
Well Lo, It All Seemed So True
They Told Me Don't Go Walkin' Slow
The Devil's On The Loose
Better Run Through The Jungle
Better Run Through The Jungle
Better Run Through The Jungle
Ohh Don't Look Back To See
Well I Thought I Heard A Rumblin'
Calling Out My Name
Two Hundred Million Guns Are Loaded
And Satan Cries Take Aim
Better Run Through The Jungle
Better Run Through The Jungle
Better Run Through The Jungle
Ohh Don't Look Back To See
Now Over On The Mountain
Thunder Magic Spoke
Said Let The People Know My Wisdom
Fill The Land With Smoke
Better Run Through The Jungle
Better Run Through The Jungle
Better Run Through The Jungle
Ohh Don't Look Back To See
