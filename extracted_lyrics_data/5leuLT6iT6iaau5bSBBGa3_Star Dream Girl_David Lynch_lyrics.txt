They're coming from all around, flying down that wide highway
Coming like crowds, like never before
Her being the one they can't wait to see
Every night they come to dream of her
Every night they come to dream of her
Star dream girl, star dream girl
Crank up that radio
Every night they come, flying down that wide highway
They're coming from all around
Coming like crowds, like never before
Her being the one they can't wait to see
Her being the one
Her being the one they can't wait to see
Star dream girl, star dream girl
Star dream girl, star dream girl
Every night they come to dream of her
Every night they come to dream of her
Star dream girl, star dream girl
Star dream girl, star dream girl
