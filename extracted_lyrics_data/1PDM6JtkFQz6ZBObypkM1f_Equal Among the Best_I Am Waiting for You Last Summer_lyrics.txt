1 ContributorEqual Among the Best LyricsIf you want me just to wound me and lick open sores of my soul
You need me as a meal, as an animal haunting its victim
I don't agree, no, not anymore
You called me just to make me feel cold again, I don't agree
My dear friend, we're different
Blackminded boy with a wonderful heart
Let me know why you're all torn apart
Understanding will save you
You will stay alive and light
Time is not linear, I let go my fear
I am love, you're the sun, shine bright
Time's not linear, I let go my fears
I am the goddess, went thru pains –
Everyone has to on this planet…
Callouses lead to callousness, of course
But now it's getting better more or less
Everyone's equal among the best
Everyone's equal among the best
The faults I see in others' lives
Are often true of me
So help me, Lord, to recognize
My own hypocrisyYou might also likeEmbed
