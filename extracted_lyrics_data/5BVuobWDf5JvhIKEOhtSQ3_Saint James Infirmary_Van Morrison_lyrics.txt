2 ContributorsSaint James Infirmary Lyrics
Ah
Ah

I went down to St. James Infirmary
For to see, for to see my baby there
Man, she was laid out on a long white table
She was so cold and so cool and so fair

Let her go, let her go, God bless her
Wherever she might be
Lord, you can search this whole, search this whole wide world over
But she ain't never gonna find another lover man like me

When I die, I want you to dress me in straight lace shoes
I want a box back coat and a Stetson hat
I want a twenty dollar gold piece on my watch chain
So everybody gonna know that I died standing pat

Ah
