Until nothing
Until nothing
Until nothing
We come from a place where we count the days
Until nothing
Until nothing
Until nothing
Keep walking...
Keep walking...
Keep walking...
We're running down the street in our underwear
We're running up the hill, it's over there
We're running down the street in our underwear
We're running up the hill, it's over there
Cause nothing ever happens here
Cause nothing ever happens here
Where everyone keeps off the grass
No littering, no loitering
No nothing
No nothing
No nothing
We're running down the street in our underwear (cause nothing ever happens here)
We're running up the hill, it's over there (Oh my Lord)
We're running down the street in our underwear (Oh my Lord, cause nothing happens here)
We're running up the hill, it's over there (Oh my Lord)
We come from a place where we count the days
Until nothing
Until nothing
Until nothing
We come from a place where we count the days
Until nothing
Until nothing
Until nothing (Oh my Lord)
We're running down the street in our under wear (cause nothing happens here)
We're running up the hill, it's over there (Oh my Lord)
We're running down the streets in in our underwear (Oh my Lord, cause nothing happens here)
We're running up the hill, it's over there (Oh my Lord)You might also like1Embed
