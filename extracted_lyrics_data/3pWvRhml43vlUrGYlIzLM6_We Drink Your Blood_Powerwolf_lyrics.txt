Oh mother God, we hold the sword in holy time
We are the war, never see the light
Beyond our call, we all will take more human wine
And we toast to the night

We fold our hands, we keep the Bible in our minds
Oh father God, we are the hordes of Cain!
And though you run, we will take you and we find
Any type, any vein

We drink your blood
When the midnight sky is red
We drink your blood
And we call the sanguine saints
We drink your blood
When the midnight sky is red
We drink your blood
And we open your veins

Oh father Lord, we are the demons of the wild
When all we pray, stand and fight as one
We tame the storm, we are the martyrs in the light
Take your soul when you run

We are the dark, we are the saints of blood at night
We hear the call, when the moon shines red
We grab your body, in the morning all we are
Satisfied and you're dead

We drink your blood
When the midnight sky is red
We drink your blood
And we call the sanguine saints
We drink your blood
When the midnight sky is red
We drink your blood
And we open your veins

Roro-soyo-rono
Royo-sono-royo-so-nono
Royo-rono-soyo-roro-roro-soyo-rono
Royo-sono-royo-nodo-to
We drink, we drink
We drink your blood!
Kyrie Eleison
We drink, we drink
We drink your blood!
Kyrie Eleison
We drink your blood
When the midnight sky is red
We drink your blood
And we call the sanguine saints
We drink your blood
When the midnight sky is red
We drink your blood
And we open your veins8Embed
