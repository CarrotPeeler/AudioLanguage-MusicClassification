1 ContributorOne Love Lyrics
Ever since you been gone
Got me wonderin', baby
Why it's takin' me so long
To make you my baby
Now I know we said weren't gonna rush
I was the first to say it
But I been thinkin' 'bout your touch
My mind keeps replayin' it

(And everything I once stood for)
I take it all back for your love
(I realize that I want you more)
Talkin' 'bout maybe gettin' serious
'Cause baby, it's time we talked
So that we could just discuss
Where we gonna try and go from here
'Cause baby this here ain't enough

Baby, what about us? (Baby, what about us?)
We could be just one love (We could be just one love)
Baby, what about us? (We could be)
One love, one love
We're lucky to just have just one-one
(All I need is one)
You might also like
And ever since you left that night
I can't stop thinkin' 'bout you
Seems like somethin' just ain't right
Spendin' days without you
Now I tried my best to hold my tongue
But it's time to get indignant
Baby, we should just be one
So sugar say, "I'm with it"

(And everything I once stood for)
I take it all back for your love
(I realize that I want you more)
Talkin' 'bout maybe gettin' serious
'Cause baby, it's time we talked
So that we could just discuss
Where we gonna try and go from here
'Cause baby this here ain't enough

Baby, what about us? (Baby, what about us?)
We could be just one love (We could be just one love)
Baby, what about us? (We could be)
One love, one love
We're lucky to just have just one-one
(All I need is one)
Baby, I need you
'Cause I adore you
You're the only one I'm kissin', babe
You be the only one I'm missin', baby
You hold my heart and soul
Makin' plans, settin' dates, kinda let me know
If I'm the one for you, my one and only love

Baby, what about us? (We could be, we could be, yeah)
We could be just one love (Baby, what about us? What about us?)
Baby, what about us? (We could be, yeah)
One love, one love (we could be)
We're lucky to just have just one-one (we could be)
(One love, oh yeah)
Baby, what about us? (Woah)
We could be just one love (One love)
Baby, what about us? (Ah yeah, ah yeah, we could be, yeah)
One love, one love (ha)
We're lucky to just have just one-one
(All I need is...)Embed
