3 ContributorsCrying Just for Show LyricsFeelin sick like everybody is
Holdin up the wall like it could fall in
Waited with your arms all night
You know how to feel alright
And you love all everybody here
Even when you want some all to disappear
Thought of doin somethin right
I do
Give me some was and to find alone
Know that it's a bit to make ya swallow
Tryin to make you drive all night
Tryin to put up all the fights
But you love this any way you know
When you come clean you're crying just for show
Maybe half of all the time
And every once in a great while
They will catch you when you smile
They know how to feel alright
I do
Do
