Cultivating the anomalies
Alterating in depth perception
Expanding upon reality
Improving enhancing pervading progress
Retracting codes of morality
A flawless unit of inherent perfection
Correcting the faults of humanity
Our elements become one
Endorse the transition
No lack of comprehending
Specifics of the philosophy
Attributions of human error
In contrast with proficiencyYou might also likeEmbed
