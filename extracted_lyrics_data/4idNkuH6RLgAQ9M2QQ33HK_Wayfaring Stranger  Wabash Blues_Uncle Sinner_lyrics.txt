I'm a-travellin' through this world of woe
There ain't no sickness, toil, or danger
In that bright world to which I go
I'm goin' there to see my father
He said he'd meet me when I come
I'm only goin' over Jordan
I'm only goin' over home
I know dark clouds will gather around me
I know my way be rough and steep
The beautiful song of those who've fallen
Are just before this world to see
I'm goin' there to see my mother
I'm goin' there, no more to roam
I'm only goin' over Jordan
I'm only goin' over home
I'll soon be free from earthly trials
My own body rest in the old churchyard
I'll drop my cross of self-denial
And I'll journey to my great rewardYou might also likeEmbed
