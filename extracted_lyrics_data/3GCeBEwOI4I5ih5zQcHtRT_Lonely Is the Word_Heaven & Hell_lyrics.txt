1 ContributorThe Ghost of Ronnie Dio (Rephlummoxed) LyricsThe ghost of Dio comes to our practice space every midnight
& with his help, a tasty jam is what we're sure to write
I hope he helps us write something like "I" or "Holy Diver"
With amplified technology, his words we'll decipher
But after all what do you say
To the dead king warlock of rock n' roll?
Look for the sign: the last in line
The words that will reveal you to your soul
A sage, or mage, of ancient age who died a little too young
Of dragons, & devils, & ancient beasts he primarily sung
To say his ghost is haunting us seems frightfully absurd
I'd demonstrate some actual proof, but lonely is the word
Through rainbow eyes the wizard flies
To legions of the brave to save again
The chosen ones, the bastard sons
The mob rules to follow the tears away
Look away from the sea
Those evil eyes staring at you & me
This is some southern sign
They’ll burn the sun and drown the children at sea
If you truly have a spark, don’t lock it all up
Or you’re just a rainbow in the dark
You might also likeEvery time I climb upon a mountain
I see the silver lighting in the black
Those who shine won't be borne to heaven
Those facing hell better turn backEmbed
