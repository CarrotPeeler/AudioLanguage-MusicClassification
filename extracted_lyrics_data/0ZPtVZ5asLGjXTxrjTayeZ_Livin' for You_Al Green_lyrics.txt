5 ContributorsLivinâ€™ For You Lyrics
I guess there's no good reason, for livin'
But I'll keep on livin' for you, baby
There's nothing else to do, babe
But spend my life holding and lovin' you
Oh

If I ask you more than one million times to forgive me
You think of a reason why
That you should make me cry (Don't make me cry, baby)
Walk out and say goodbye away from me
Oh, hey

I'm tired of the bright ideas about leavin' me
When you know you're not goin' nowhere but here with me
Here with me

Let me tell you one thing
Stop and think of just how good I've been to you baby, please
I'm not causin' no trouble for you baby
This story just can't be true, baby (Just can't be true, baby)
How can I convince you, baby
But just tell you the truth
You might also like
I'm livin' for you, givin' for you, waitin' for you
(Lemme tell you what I'm doin')
I'm layin' for you, prayin' for you, workin' for you
(Livin' my life, I tell you that)
I'm livin' for you, givin' for you, givin' for you
(Oh, my, my, my)
Layin' for you, prayin' for you, workin' for you
(Everything I do, everything I do I still)
Do with you (Something to) do with you
Do with you
That's why I keep on saying, livin' for you, workin' for you ...Embed
