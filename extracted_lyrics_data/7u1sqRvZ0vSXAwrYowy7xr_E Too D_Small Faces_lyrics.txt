3 ContributorsE Too D LyricsSometimes I feel
Like a frustrated child
I got everything I want
There's nothing that I need
I can't stop my brain from runnin' wild
Runnin' wild (runnin' wild)
My brain
My brain is runnin' wild
Sometimes I look inside me
And I don't like what I see
Seems like my soul is made of paper
So I took a look outside myself
Tryna get myself together
Now I'm fine
I've just been missin'
Missin' of my mind
So now my troubles are all over
But no peace to find
I was right and they were wrong
I have messed up my mind
You see those colors
Hear those voices
What's those voices?
Woah those voices
I can't take any voicesYou might also likeEmbed
