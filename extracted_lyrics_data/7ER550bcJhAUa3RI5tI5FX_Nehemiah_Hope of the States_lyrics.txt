1 ContributorNehemiah LyricsNehemiah, last survivor
In this cynical world
Sparks come from anywhere
It's the fire that matters
Nehemiah sing to the storm
Make it turn around
It's all decided before you're born
Hear us singing we sing:
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
No self pity we sing:
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Friendly fire, burn the liars
Don't feel like you're alone
Let them all hide behind
Dead flags and old lies
Nehemiah you were the leader
We all just followed
Sparks come from anywhere
It's the fire that matters
Hear us singing we sing:
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
No self pity we sing:
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

People come on make a stand
Come on people if you try you can
You're not alone when the lights go off
We stand together when it all stops
Hear us singing we sing:
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
No self pity we sing:
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
People come on make a stand
Come on people if you try you can
You're not alone when the lights go off
We stand together when it all stopsEmbed
