4 ContributorsSeptuagint LyricsI assume a true above and below
One more and first of all
I endeavor the deadly uniformity
That erudition brought into this world
I doubt wherever the earth's gravity
That is boldly presumed to extend
Over the whole structure of the world
Effective beyond a certain radius
Aeon, uniformity, divine
This empty space extending on all sides
Where the suns of the suns are subordinated
I thought of a great manifold of different ones
Where double stars moving alternately
Round each other but not round a third one
A whole that does not tolerate a middle
As masses of light flow into each other
If this universe increased to its extremity
When the other side transists into a black hole
A downward spiral of the corporeal masses
Our existence is complete in both directions
I assume a separation of powers that be
Of purely demonic divine chaos
I endeavor the deadly uniformity
That erudition brought into the world
You might also likeWhen we can pass over into the other
A world, pure and silent through death
This empty space extending on all sides
A true above, a true belowEmbed
