3 ContributorsSick Salvation Lyrics
Foul-Foul-Foul-Foul prayers rise
Staring through the eye of the chasm
Still at rest but breathing
Enemy be born
Grant us knowledge of the opposition
Spew forth from the earth
Contagious is the one from which the wisdom comes
So sworn
Hibernation draws to a close
Lacerating wings unfold
Hunger will cease
Abominations speak from the dark
Now seek only death

Antichrist, rise before us
Pain from inside
Release them, souls in slavery
Come, my saviour, now!

Face is the one of a reptile
Rotting teeth and lips
Speaking words of sick salvation
Whispering eclipse
You might also like

Antichrist, rise before us
Pain from inside
Release them, souls in slavery
Come, my saviour, now!Embed
