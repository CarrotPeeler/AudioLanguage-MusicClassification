1 ContributorLittle rider Lyrics***
From the start, I told you everything
And I know, that I'm not right
And I drink and it makes me cruel
I've broken everything inside
Keep your hands on the bar
Keep your eyes on the road
Ride on, little rider, ride on
Ride on, little rider, ride on
Wouldn't you know it, I'm broke again
And the leaves are falling on London fields
This is where I taught you, how to ride, your bicycle
And now you're the greatest thing on wheels
So bottom down your collar
And buckle up your shoes
Ride on, little rider, ridе on
Ride on, little rider, ridе onYou might also likeEmbed
