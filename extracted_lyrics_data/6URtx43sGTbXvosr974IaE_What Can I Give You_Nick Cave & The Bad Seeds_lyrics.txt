6 ContributorsWhat Can I Give You? LyricsAll my life I failed to see
One good thing standing in front of me
And the planets gravitate around you
And the stars, the stars surround you
And the angels in heaven adore you
And the saints, the saints all stand and applaud you
What can I give you?
What can I give you in return?
The shadow came creeping, a criminal
That you chased, babe, from my life
And sometimes when I’m sleeping I see him shuffle against the night
Oh, he’s waiting, yeah he’s waiting to return
And each step I take moves me one step below you
And you must do in order to console me
Help me, help me, help me, baby, reach down and collect me
What can I give you?
What can I give you in return?
Galaxies collide, they shower down around you
And I searched, I stumbled and then I found you
In your robe, in your crown, reaching low, babe
Reaching low down to the ground
What can I give you?
What can I give you in return?See Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds LiveGet tickets as low as $59You might also like2Embed
