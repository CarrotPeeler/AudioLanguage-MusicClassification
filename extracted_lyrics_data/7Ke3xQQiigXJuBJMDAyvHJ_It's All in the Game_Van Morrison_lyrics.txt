5 ContributorsItâ€™s All in the Game Lyrics
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Many a tear has to fall
But it's all, it's all in the game, child
Said all in the wonderful game, alright
That we know as love (Whoo, yeah)
You had words with him
And your future's looking dim
But these things your heart can rise above
Once in a while he won't call, he won't call
But I heard you, it's all in the game
Soon he, soon he will be there
With a small, a small bouquet, he will
And he will kiss your lips
And caress you and just like that, touch you
And your heart will, yeah, fly away

You had words, words with him
And your future was looking, but don't you worry 'bout it
These things your heart, these things can rise above
Once in a while he won't, he won't, he won't call
But you gotta be patient
Soon he will be there
With a small, with a small bouquet
And he will kiss your lips
And caress your waiting fingertips, just like that
And your heart will fly away
You might also like
Listen, listen, listen, listen, listen
He will kiss your lips
And touch you
And you will feel, you will feel like
You're gonna fly, flyEmbed
