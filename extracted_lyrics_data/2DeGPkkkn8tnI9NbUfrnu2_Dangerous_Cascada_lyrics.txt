4 ContributorsDangerous Lyrics
Don't know anything about you
So close, just a touch away
Your love hits me like no other (Hits me like no other)
They say I'm a true believer
I know, something's taking over now
I wanna run, but I don't know how
You just crossed my border now
Just a kiss away

Give me a break, I'm melting away
You're so dangerous
Or is it too late?
Gotta know what's on your mind
I'm outta control 'cause you want it all
You're so dangerous (Dangerous)
My biggest mistake
I'm blinded by your eyes
(Dangerous)
I'm outta control
(Dangerous)

Don't you push it to the limit
'Cause you know, I'm hungry for your touch
No doubt, I wanna be your lover (I wanna be your lover)
They say, just a pretender
I know, something's taking over now
I wanna run, but I don't know how
You've just crossed my border now
We're standing face to face

Give me a break, I'm melting away
You're so dangerous
Or is it too late?
Gotta know what's on your mind
I'm outta control 'cause you want it all
You're so dangerous
My biggest mistake
I'm blinded by your eyes (Dangerous)
(Dangerous)

I'm outta control 'cause you want it all
You're so dangerous (Dangerous)
My biggest mistake
I'm blinded by your eyes (Dangerous)1Embed
