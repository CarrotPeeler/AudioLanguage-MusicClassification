1 ContributorRest His Soul LyricsWe were living proof of a dying dream
The truth is no one saw us coming
There's always one more song left to sing
So we hit the ground running
It was all for the light, the spark
And the moment for our miracle point
The needle raised up
And the record stopped spinning
But the music kept going
Bless his soul and lay him down
The spirit is willing but the flesh cannot be found
Unencumbered by the tedium of other men's ways
Our path was our own
Mindless, endless nights and days
Were the best that I've known
It was all for the reason for the pure simple truth
For those that have come and have gone
Sometimes I just don't know what to do
But just keep on
Bless his soul and ley him down
The spirit is willing but the flesh is in the ground
My brother, my brother won't you go on home
Your loved ones miss you and we've been gone too longYou might also likeEmbed
