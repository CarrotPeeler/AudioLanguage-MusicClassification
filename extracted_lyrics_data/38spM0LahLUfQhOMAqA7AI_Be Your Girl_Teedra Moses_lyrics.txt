13 ContributorsBe Your Girl Lyrics
Don't know if you got a girl
Don't mean to disrespect
But thoughts of you rule my world
I even dream of you, I swear
Visions of you and I
See you all around my way
Been meaning to say hi
But I'm just way too shy
I gotta make you see this is
More than just a silly crush

(And I) Wonder if you even notice me
(At all) You gotta feel me
(And I) Will love you good
(Just wanna be your girl)

All alone at night
I harbor feelings for you
Holding my pillow tight
Sometimes I even touch myself
Imagin' your pleasure baby
Next time I see you I'm
Gonna walk right up to you and
Say what's on my mind
I gotta make you see
This is (more) than just a silly crush

Just wanna be your girl

I wonder if you even notice me and

I will love you good

Your girl

(And I) Wonder if you even notice me
