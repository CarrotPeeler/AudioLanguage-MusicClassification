2 ContributorsCry LyricsOoo yeah ooo
Between my mind and a broken heart
Nobody enters, baby don't give up
I - I could start it, but I can't begin
Scared of what happens if I et you in
Would you make me cry
Would you hurt me, break me inside (oh yeah)
Would you love me or hurt me (yeah)
Caught in my mind when I want to fall
Hangin' to something, but I lost it all
I - I've been standing on a windy night
Hoping you'll call me afraid you might
Would you make me cry
Would you hurt me, break me inside (oh yeah)
Would you love me or hurt me (yeah)
Ooo we could be lovers oh baby
What was broken love could now mend
But I can shatter so treat me tenderly
Where my heart's been can't go again
Would you make me cry
Would you hurt me, heal me inside (oh yeah)
Would you make me cry
Would you love me, love me
Would you make me cryYou might also likeEmbed
