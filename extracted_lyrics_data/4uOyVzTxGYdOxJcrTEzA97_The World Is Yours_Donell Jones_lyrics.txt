1 ContributorThe World Is Yours Lyrics
Yo, it's your boy D. Jones
Hah, the rebirth of hip-hop and R&B
Yeah, I know it's been a moment
But I got to get it
Nobody holdin' me back now

Get out the way D Jones coming
Yeah the one that your girl loving
You wanna hate but you gotta love him
Plus hate will get you know where homie
Still a lot of y'all don't know me
Highly underrated but I get money
I don't front like I'm a superstar
Cause ain't no Maybach parked in my garage
But I'm the kinda guy that'll get the girls hot
Got the universal key to the g spot
It's D's season I'm a give you the reasons why I think
The world is mine

The world is yours

It's yours
It's yours
And everything in it
The world is yours
It's yours

Gotta bring back the break beats I loved it
When hip hop and R&B became first cousins
Check your boy's status sure I got flow
You can throw the hate out the window

And a lot of you'all still ain't up to no good

About to take it to a level that these cats can't reach

The world black and white about to make it all colorful
