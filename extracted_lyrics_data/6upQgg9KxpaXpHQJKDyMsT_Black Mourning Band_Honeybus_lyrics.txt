1 ContributorBlack Mourning Band LyricsMany people try to tell me that it don't matter
If you live or die or what you do between
But I wonder if they listen or if their eyes are closed
But what I find I see it's a big mystery
Put on your black mourning band my friend
And weep for those who are lost, who are dead
There's not a moment to lose you fool
Ah, you fool
Use your bucket and your spade, electric drills
And anything that you  may find on the way
But don't listen to a word that anybody says
Cos they don't realise, they just get in the way
Put on your black mourning band my friend
And weep for those who are lost, who are dead
There's not a moment to lose you fool
You fool
Put on your black mourning band my friend
And weep for those who are lost, who are dead
There's not a moment to lose you fool
Put on your black mourning band my friend
And weep for those who are lost, who are dead
There's not a moment to lose you fool
Ah, you foolYou might also likeEmbed
