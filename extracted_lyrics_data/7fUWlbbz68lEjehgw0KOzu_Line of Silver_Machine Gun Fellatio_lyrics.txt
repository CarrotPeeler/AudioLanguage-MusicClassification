2 ContributorsLine Of Silver LyricsTake a line of silver, take a line of coke
Take a line of silver, take a line of coke
Take a line of silver, take a line of coke
Take a line of silver
Don't forget your favourite things
Don't forget your favourite things
Booty in the crib on the non-stop summer's day
It's good, getting better, getting better in so many ways
Take a line of silver, take a line of coke
Add it up together Kylie Minogue
Shake it up together on a non-stop summer's day
Don't forget your favourite things
Don't forget your favourite things
There is a bar out on Neptune
There's a bar where nobody has to pay
And up above the storm clouds
There's blue, blue skies today
Just don't forget your favourite things
Don't forget your favourite things
You might also likeBooty in the crib on the non-stop summer's day
It's good, getting better, getting better in so many ways
So, take a line of silver, take a line of coke
Take a line of silver, take a line of coke
Take a line of silver, take a line of coke
Take a line of silver
Don't forget your favourite things
Don't forget your favourite things
Don't forget your favourite thingsEmbed
