1 ContributorEp LyricsThis is barely a word
If I can hold on to a page
And if I don't, will pass soon
You might forget it again
And you're so careful with the terms
But they slipped in your hands
'Cause you wrote 'Love' and I know you mean it
Yeah, you wrote 'Love' and I know you mean it
And do you hold on to it too?
And do you curse the way I go
Is every new street that you move to
Just an empty road
Well, I don't care about the past
And if we made a mistake then I wanna repeat it
'Cause it's not gone and I wanna repeat it
It's just a second of your time
Gone like a casual sign
Just to know I'll never shake it off so easily
I'll never shake it off, shake it off in time
And if you're staring at the screen
Still deciding how to say what you mean, yeah you can
All the things that you mean, yes, you can
You might also likeBut should I try to put it off?
'Cause when I try to be cool, well, I just can't fake it
I'm making things worse when I just can't fake it
But if you wanted me to stop
You never say the things you do
Up, in the middle of the night, yeah
'Cause you know just what it leads to
That I can never hold my tongue
'Cause I love you so bad and I wanna repeat it
I love you so bad now I'm gonna repeat it
I love you so bad and I wanna repeat it
I love you so bad and I wanna repeat it
I love you too bad 'cause I'm gonna repeat it
I love you so bad and I'm gonna repeat it
I love you so bad and I wanna repeat it
I love you so bad and I wanna repeat it
I love you too bad 'cause I'm gonna repeat it
I love you so bad, so bad
It's just a second of your time
Gone like a casual sign
Just to know you'll never shake it off so easily
Come on, now, baby, don't deny it
I see your eyes and now I'll prove it
'Cause we know we'll never shake this off and why should we?
It's a dream
You don't need to change nothing at all
There's no 
Time could change nothing at all
There's no Embed
