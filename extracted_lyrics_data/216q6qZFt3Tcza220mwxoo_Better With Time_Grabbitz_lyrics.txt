10 ContributorsBetter With Time Lyrics
You don't look back when I call you
But does that mean that you're not there?
Go back to when I saw you
A beautiful time in a deadly year
You think I'm stupid but I get it now
How long can we make this go?
Just hurry up and spit it out
Baby, 'cause I gotta know

Don't break away
'Cause I want to stay
'Cause I want to stay
Don't break away
'Cause I want to stay
'Cause I want to stay
'Cause I want to stay
Don't break away
'Cause I want to stay
'Cause I want to stay
Don't break away
'Cause I want to stay
'Cause I want to stay

I let it consume me
I let it control me
I'll always be lonely
I'll never be fine
If life is a movie
It's always so boring
Where is the story?
I hope it gets better with time
Yeah, I hope it gets better with time
Yeah, I hope it gets better with time
You might also like
Yeah, I hope it gets better with time

You don't look back when I call you
But does that mean that you don't care?
Go back to when I saw you
Your beautiful eyes with a deadly stare
You think I'm stupid but I get it now
How long can we make this go?
It won't hurt to let it out
Baby, 'cause I gotta know

Don't break away
'Cause I want to stay
'Cause I want to stay
Don't break away
'Cause I want to stay
'Cause I want to stay
'Cause I want to stay
Don't break away
'Cause I want to stay
'Cause I want to stay
Don't break away
'Cause I want to stay
'Cause I want to stay
I let it consume me
I let it control me
I'll always be lonely
I'll never be fine
If life is a movie
It's always so boring
Where is the story?
I hope it gets better with time
Yeah, I hope it gets better with time

Yeah, I hope it gets better with time
Yeah, I hope it gets better with time
I hope it gets better with time
I hope it gets better with time
I hope it gets better with time, time
Yeah, I hope it gets better with time
I hope it gets better with time
I hope it gets better with time

I let it consume me
I let it control me
I'll always be lonely
I'll never be fine
If life is a movie
It's always so boring
Where is the story?
I hope it gets better with time
Yeah, I hope it gets better with time1Embed
