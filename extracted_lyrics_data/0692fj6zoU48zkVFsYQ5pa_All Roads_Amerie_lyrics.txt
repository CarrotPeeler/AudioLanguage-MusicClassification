4 ContributorsAll Roads Lyrics
When I least expect it
The unexpected
When I wasn't looking
When I had no hope
When I stop believing
When I lost my place
It was there, I found you
And I found my way

(Oh) All roads lead to you
No matter where I am
I know that you are standing by my side
(Oh) All roads lead to you
No matter where I've been
I know you've always been my guiding light

And how'd you know that
I'd be here with you (Here with you)
How did you see that nothing could replace ya
(Nothing's gonna replace you)
'Cause no matter where I turn
Yes, it all came back to you (You)
And no matter what may come
I know that you'lll be here to see me through, ooh
You might also like
(Oh) All roads lead to you
No matter where I am
I know that you'll be standing by my side
(Oh) All roads lead to you (Oh, yeah)
No matter where I've been
I know that you have been my guiding light

I search to find high and low (Search to find, high and low)
For something that was missing
It took some time for me to see (Took some time for me to see that)
Just where my life was leading
No looking back (No looking back)
A new beginning's waiting (A new beginning)
And now I know I never ever have to be alone (Never, no)

(Oh) All roads lead to you (No, no)
No matter where I am
I know that you'll be standing by my side
(Oh) All roads lead to you (Oh, yeah)
No matter where I've been
I know you've always been my guiding light

(Oh) All roads lead to you (All roads)
I know you've always been by my side
(Oh) All roads lead to you (I know, I know well)
I know you'll always be my guiding light
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah
All roads lead to youEmbed
