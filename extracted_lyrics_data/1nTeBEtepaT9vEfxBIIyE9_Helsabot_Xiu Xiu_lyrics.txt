I did something bad
Start again, and just do a little bit slower

I did something bad
I got in a fight
About drugs
Kicked him in the neck

I am Helsabot
I am all you're not
But you wish you were
I am working hard
Don't you laugh at me
I am Helsabot
Alcohol fueled robot

I take off my clothes
Then I say to Joe
"Do your pants ever just fall off, off, off?"
A menage-et-trois' fine

I am Helsabot
I am all you're not
But you wish you were
I am working hard
Don't you laugh at me
I am Helsabot
Alcohol fueled robotYou might also like1Embed
