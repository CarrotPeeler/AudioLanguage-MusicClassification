Electric lips that shock me to the bone
When I turn my back, she's gone in flash
I've gotta find her, been working on that
I know when I catch her I ain't gonna let her go
I'm gonna make my way on back up down the road
Gonna tell her that I need her, tell her I love her so
Lord where did she go?
Don't go wasting lightning, don't go wasting time
That girl down the road, she ain't the waiting kind
She ain't dancing on the bar at the Buccaneer
She ain't drinking with the boys underneath the pier
Now she ain't at her sister's, she ain't at the tracks
I'm gonna find her, gonna bring her back
I know when I catch her I ain't gonna let her go
Gonna make my way on back up down the road
Gonna tell her that I need her, tell her I love her so
Lord where did she go?
Don't go wasting lightning, don't go wasting time
That girl down the road, she ain't the waiting kind
She was on fire, I remember the kiss
In the car there beside her, with the sparks from her lips
And the way that she looked, like a storm on the rise
Wind in her hair, rain in her eyes
I remember so, like a thunderbolt
And the fire in her kiss and the sparks from her lips
And the look in her eyes like a storm on the rise
Gonna make my way on back up down the road
Gonna tell her that I need her, tell her that I love her so
Lord where did she go? I said Lord where did she go?
Don't go wasting lightning, don't go wasting time
That girl down the road, she ain't the waiting kind
I said don't go wasting lightning, don't go wasting time
That girl down the road, she ain't the waiting kind
I said that girl down the road, she ain't the waiting kind
I said that girl down the road, she ain't the waiting kindYou might also likeEmbed
