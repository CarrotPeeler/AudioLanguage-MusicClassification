I find a certain comfort in searchin' through the
Darkness on my quest to find the light
And as I'm digging through the ruins, that line these city streets
A sense of hope walks with me

Still I hold onto this dream of a scarless heart and a spiteless mind
No longer shall I try to find a name-less ghost nor provide
A shelter for my-

Demons, there's so many I smell brimstone
Comin' through family, I'm seein' all of the sin shown
Kin grown into enemies, then it be your friends gone
Ain't you very lonely, but a sanctuary when grim's home
Got rules but I dig it, God knows that I'm wicked
Or does it, 'cause when I tug it, it never shows that I visit
Tell the judge, y'all make me feel like it's hell to love
So stand not amazed when I let loose on my Beelzebubs
My spirit needs jumper cables, never know love but I want ya label
I'm comfort-able
Nothing lately makes me feel they worthy of trustin'
So I load my gun with the intentions of bustin'

Still I hold onto this dream of a scarless heart and a spiteless mind
No longer shall I try to find a nameless ghost nor provide
A shelter for my demons

Shelter for my demons ...to hide

I'm, cool with the trauma now
'Cause it's abundant, ever since I laid my mama down
Some members talked me so bad, 'til my persona found
No mercy, go earthly, cock and make the llama sound
'Cause that's the language they know, deep in anguish they grow
To people without rules, and make you doubt who
Should love you forever 'cause they gave you some hateful mouth ooze
I was so effin' true, but I became the person to shout to
Now that I'm lonely, I don't give no Pho like Laos food
And I'm such a meanie, wanna come and see me? Reroute dudes
I'm chillin' in Hell in hot water sittin' on my couch fools
So it ain't no problem walkin' through yo' hell in my house shoes

I find a certain comfort in searchin' through the
Darkness on my quest to find the light
And as I'm digging through the ruins, that line these city streets
A sense of hope walks with me
Still I hold onto this dream of a scarless heart and a spiteless mind
No longer shall I try to find a nameless ghost nor provide
A shelter for my demons

(...to hide
Shelter for my demons ...to hide
Shelter for my demons
Shelter for my demons)

I'm good where I am in the dark, been in dark for so long
I'm comfortable with it
Bring it, if you got it to bring10Embed
