2 ContributorsWhen My Dreamboat Comes Home LyricsWhen my dreamboat comes home
And my dream no more will roam
I will meet you and I'll greet you
When my dreamboat comes home
Moonlit waters will sing
On that tender love you bring
We will be sweethearts, yes forever
When my dreamboat comes home
When my dreamboat comes home
And my dream no more will roam
I will meet you and I'll greet you
When my dreamboat comes home
Moonlit water will sing
Of the tender love you'll bring
We will be sweethearts, yes forever
