13 ContributorsHole Lyrics
She turns it off when I'm coming home
Loses the feeling when you're so alone
I'm just another one drifting away
When tables turn, I'm here to stay
'Cause it's not true what they say
I'm just stuck in a hole
Yeah, it could go, it could go my way
I'm just stuck in a hole

So sick, so tired, never let it go
You just can't leave it alone
No fun, never really won
Had the dirty smile wiped from my face
Yeah, we tried to pray for you, son
Oh, we'd hate to see you fall from grace

She turns it off when I'm coming home
Loses the feeling when you're so alone
I'm just another one fading away
When darkness falls, it's here to stay
'Cause it's not true what they say
I'm just stuck in a hole
Yeah, it could go, it could go my way
I'm just stuck in a hole
You might also like
So sick, so tired, never let it go
You just can't leave it alone
No fun, never really won
Had the dirty smile wiped from my face
Yeah, we tried to pray for you, son
Oh, we'd hate to see you fall from grace

Yeah, it could go, it could go my way
Yeah, it could go, it could go my way
Yeah, it could go, it could go my way
Yeah, it could go, it could go my way
Yeah, it could go, it could go my way
Yeah, it could go, it could go my way
I'm just stuck in a hole
I'm just stuck in a holeEmbed
