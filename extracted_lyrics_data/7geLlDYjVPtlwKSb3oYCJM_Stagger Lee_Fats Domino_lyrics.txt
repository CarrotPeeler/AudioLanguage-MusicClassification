1 ContributorStagger Lee LyricsI was standin' on the corner
When I heard my bull dog bark
He was barkin' at the two men
Who were gamblin' in the dark
It was Stagger Lee and Billy
Two men who gambled late
Stagger lee threw a seven
And Billy swore that he threw eight
Stagger Lee, told Billy
I can't let you go with that
You have won all my money
And my brand-new Stetson hat
So Stagger Lee went home
And he got his fouty-four
Said I'm goin' to the barroom
Just to pay that debt I owe
Stagger Lee went to the bar
And he opened up the barroom door
Said Nobody move now
I've got my forty-four
Stagger Lee shot Billy
He shot that poor boy so bad
That a bullet went through Billy
And broke the bartender's glass
Go, Stagger Lee
Go, Stagger Lee
Go, Stagger Lee
Please don't shot poor meYou might also likeEmbed
