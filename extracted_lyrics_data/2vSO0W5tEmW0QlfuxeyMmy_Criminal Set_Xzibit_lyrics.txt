Outside the South Central area, few cared about the violence
Because it didn't affect them
Break 'em off somethin'

Back to the criminal set
But they can't catch me yet
Don't trip you might break your neck (Break 'em off somethin')
And get wet from the rain of the tec, I (Break 'em off somethin')
Back to the criminal set
But they can't catch me yet
Your gum bumpin' gon' lead to gun bumpin' (Break 'em off somethin')
I'm the one when the party is jumpin' to (Break 'em off somethin')

I heard the O.G.'s they don't hit
And I'm the only one left from the West that you can't fuck with
But lately I've been feelin' like Will Smith
Why bother with rap when I can get 20 mil' on a flick? (Yeah!)
Y'all niggas just started some shit, the underdog
Makin' songs for them hogs, and them Bloods and Crips
When it show up by the mall with a Muslim scent
After all, who do you call to rock your shit? (Break 'em off somethin') (Haha)
Bust the ghetto bird, circle above, reminisce (Woo!)
Of the dust kicked up, the dirt swept under the rug
Duct tape, ski-mask, tape recorders
Cue K's, ready to blaze and bakin' soda
First learned how to cook in a coffee pot
Made the block get hot like lava rock
Got love for the block cause I came from that
But I ain't afraid to go right back (Break 'em off somethin')
Yeah!
You might also like
Back to the criminal set
But they can't catch me yet
Don't trip you might break your neck (Break 'em off somethin')
And get wet from the rain of the tec, I (Break 'em off somethin')
Back to the criminal set
But they can't catch me yet
Your gum bumpin' gon' lead to gun bumpin' (Break 'em off somethin')
I'm the one when the party is jumpin' to (Break 'em off somethin')

(Yeah!) It's a, suicide, it's a suicide
If you ever get the heart to try fuckin' with mines
No chains, I'm rockin' the nine (Hah), you ridin' the pine (Break 'em off somethin') (Uh-huh)
The heavy metal knock you out of your mind (Break 'em off somethin') (Woo!)
Now how many really gon' ride, when the war start?
Eaten alive by these hollow-tip darts (Blap!)
My 12 gauge'll tear you apart, don't get caught at the light
The house party or the neighbourhood park (C'mon!)
Mr. X marks the spot then pops the mark
Turn your whole neighbourhood to a parkin' lot (Yeah)
I paid the cost to be the boss
And will do my time standin' up 'til I get an appeal (Yeah)
These weapons too real to conceal, so why bother (Hah)
Semper fidelis, I learned from my father (Ah!)
I always stay faithful to myself and grow
But when I catch that ass after the show (Break 'em off somethin') Yeah!
Back to the criminal set
But they can't catch me yet
Don't trip you might break your neck (Break 'em off somethin')
And get wet from the rain of the tec, I (Break 'em off somethin')
Back to the criminal set
But they can't catch me yet
Your gum bumpin' gon' lead to gun bumpin' (Break 'em off somethin')
I'm the one when the party is jumpin' to (Break 'em off somethin')

I'm slick and slippery
On a high-speed chase all the way to the victory (Yeah!)
Y'all niggas is stone cold mysteries
Too weak, can't stand in the ring with me (Uh-huh)
Put a pussy back in his place (Ah), straight-laced
With the Strong Arm Steady gang up in your face
I run a race with the West to my back
While you're the reason why they say niggas in the West can't rap (Woo!)
Ever since the white Concourse 'Llac, I've been unmatched
A avalanche in the hood on attack (Huh)
Just hardcore actual facts (Huh), never wait
Just react when them killers come at you with gats (Yeah!)
Had to dig the knife out of my back, now I'm back on track
Hittin' laps, 'bout to widen the gap, yo (C'mon)
It ain't the long fall from the top that got 'em
It was the sharp sudden stop at the bottom, haha (Break 'em off somethin') (Yeah!)
Back to the criminal set
But they can't catch me yet
Don't trip you might break your neck (Break 'em off somethin')
And get wet from the rain of the tec, I (Break 'em off somethin')
Back to the criminal set
But they can't catch me yet
Your gum bumpin' gon' lead to gun bumpin' (Break 'em off somethin')
I'm the one when the party is jumpin' to (Break 'em off somethin')1Embed
