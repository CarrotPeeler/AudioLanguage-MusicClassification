She's like a child
Except that she is grown
If we cannot find the yellow lines
How then can we know
When we're driving on
The wrong side of the road?
Wrong side of the road
Welcome to what you have bought
I'd like to thank you, thank you a lot
For hangin' up on words and on walls
And takin' these calls
So do you have what it takes?
To drive in the city
You better slam on your brakes
You better step on the gas
You better not come in last
But you can't go too fast
Driving Alexis all of the way home
She's like a child
Except that she is grown
If we can't find the yellow lines
How then can we know
If we're driving on
The wrong side of the road?
Wrong side of the road
You might also likeWe hit, we run, and we spill
Poor little freedom
We're bleedin' him still
Get on the bandwagon
Or end up road kill
There's no free will
Driving Alexis all of the way home
She's like a child
Except that she is grown
If we cannot find the yellow lines
How then can we know
When we're driving on
The wrong side of the road?
Wrong side of the road
I took a long drive just for you
What else can I do
But hope one day
The truth will see me through?
I hardly believe it hurts so badly
Oh Bradley, for you to say
What you think we should do
Wrong side of the road
Driving Alexis all of the way home
We're just like children
Except that we are grown
If we cannot find the yellow lines
How then can we know
When we're driving on
The wrong side of the road?
Wrong side of the road...
Wrong side of the road...
Wrong side of the road...
Wrong side of the road...Embed
