15 ContributorsI Wanna Be Lyrics
Look (Ooh)
I know we've been friends for a while now (Hey, hey)
But, I just feel like I can confess to you (Na-na-na-na-na, yeah)
It's gon' be hard but (Oh)
Alright, here it goes

Imagine that the pillow that you cried on was my chest
And the tissue that you wiped your face with was my hand
Girl, imagine if you needed advice about some other guy
I'm the one that comes to mind
Not tryna hear you tell nobody that I'm just a friend
Just tryna make sure I'm that body that you call your man
And any time you need a shoulder
It's yours, night or day, but what I'm tryna say is

I wanna be the last number you call late at night (Said I wanna be)
First one that you dial when you open your eyes
Wanna be the one you run to
Wanna be the one that ain't gon' hurt you
I wanna be, yeah, wanna be, yeah
Be the man making your girls jealous (Girl, I wanna be)
Be the guy shutting down all the fellas (Oh)
Whatever you need, girl, it's all on me
Your soldier, your friend or your lover (Oh), girl, I wanna be

Would it be cool, would you mind if I called you my boo?
What if the next whip you was pushing was the one I bought for you?
Can I be the one that meets your pops and take your mama shopping?
Be the only one they like
Wait, have you thought about it
Wait, really thought about it?
Maybe you should take some time
Call your girls and talk about it, yeah
'Cause I done already made up my mind (My mind)
Don't need no more time to know if I wanna be with you

I wanna be the last number you call late at night (Yeah, I wanna be, yeah)
First one that you dial when you open your eyes (Oh)
Wanna be the one you run to (Wanna be that)
Wanna be the one that ain't gon' hurt you (Wanna be that)
I wanna be, yeah, wanna be, yeah
Be the man making your girls jealous (I wanna)
Be the guy shutting down all the fellas (All the fellas, yeah)
Whatever you need (Whatever you need), girl, it's all on me
Your soldier, your friend or your lover (Hey), girl, I wanna be

Put me on your screen saver, all over your MySpace
And make me one of your top favorites, that's where I wanna be
The one you crying for, stand up for and fighting for
Wanna be your good, bad, love, hate, girl
Cross my heart, hope to die, on everything that's good
I'ma do you right, show you right, get this understood
Cross my heart, hope to die, on everything that's good
I'ma do you right, show you right, get this understood
I wanna be the last number you call late at night (Oh, oh)
First one that you dial when you open your eyes (When you open your eyes)
Wanna be the one you run to
Wanna be the one that ain't gon' hurt you (Oh)
I wanna be, yeah (I wanna be yours), wanna be, yeah
Be the man making your girls jealous (Jealous, yeah)
Be the guy shutting down all the fellas (Fellas)
Whatever you need (Oh), girl, it's all on me
Your soldier, your friend or your lover, girl, I wanna be

Oh, I wanna be yours
Girl, I wanna be yours
I wanna be yours
Be yours
I wanna be, be yours
I wanna be, be yours13Embed
