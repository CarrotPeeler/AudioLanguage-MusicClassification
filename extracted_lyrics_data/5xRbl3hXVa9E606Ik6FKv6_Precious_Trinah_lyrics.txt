2 Contributors4:45 LyricsHook
Do you wanna ride?
It's 4:45 in the AM
She slide when i say when..
She slide..
 Petey Weedey
I said im done bitch
I said im through hoe
It's getting late & the dime inside my mind is faded
Come on nigga, like another 20 bitches is waitin'
It was 4:45, she drove by & she sucked
We got buck, took a bump
And we fucked, till the sun, came up
And no one knows whats going on...
I took yo bitch, she left her thong
I checked my phone, i hit up Clip
We smoked a spliff & then we dipped
In the whip
Disappeared into the city mist
With a bitch in the back in a hat with a grasp & a big ol ass
She dont smoke, she just pass, we just choke, fuck n laugh
The night continues.. threw her on the red table
Pussy drippin like syrup
She askin where the smash at?
She only want the dick, no thoughts about the cash
Repeat the same cycle on a different ass
Different night
Im slowin down now , pour the 4 up in my sprite
Light my doobie up, gettin ready for round 2 tonight

 Clip 2.7.5
4 45's in my drop
Checkin on the clock
Shake it just a little bit
I got a lot hustle on the block
Plus u know I'm smokin on that medical a lot
Now Blow endo... go...
Endo go... Endo go...
Endo go .. Endo go....
Endo Smoke... Endo smoke..
Endo smoke... Endo smoke..
I'm ridin dirty
Trippin cross Florida
Just to see that ass
& fuck wit you
I'm tryna pour it up
Fuck them sluts
I love you bitch
Cuz when I'm wit you
Ain't shit matter
But how we gon' get our asses home
Cuz we be drunk n laughter
Fills the night, we take a bump
We feel the night
I throw you up
Against the wall
That bathroom stall
Rippin off yo clothes
Take off yo bra, u throw that ass Back
All in all, It was fun
I had a ball
But when I be gone we fall apart like we ain't gon' front at all
Damn
Precious

Wit u girl But I know u know
That we gotta keep the fuckin on the low

Oh

Wit u girl But I know u know
That we gotta keep the fuckin on the low
