5 ContributorsSoul Evisceration Lyrics
Surgical exposure
Embalmed in blood and unaware
Your heart collapsing in the wake
Your eyes are frozen in a stare
Imprisonment in flesh
Deadened body holding cell
Necrobiosis cuts the way on through
Rotting soul condemned to hell

I cut away, sculpture death
Carve in your thoughts
Blood spray, parasite breath
Breed is the cause
Violate, desecrate
Sever the spine
I dissect, so perfect
Muscles that bind

Soul evisceration

Nauseating pressure
Internal landscapes overflow
Bleeding forth the secrets of your soul
The human body death row (Death row, death row)
Instalment of distress
Revolting death is now complete
Your suffering is taking human form
My own disease is named "deceit"
You might also like
I, I cut away, sculpture death
Carve in your thoughts
Blood spray, parasite breath
Breed is the cause
Violate, desecrate
Sever the spine
I dissect, so perfect
Muscles that bind

Soul evisceration
