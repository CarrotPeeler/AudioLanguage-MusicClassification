1 ContributorStarrider LyricsI stole a ride... on a passing star...
Not knowing where I was going, how near or how far."
" Through years of light... lands of future and past...
'Til the Heavenly gaze... was sighted at last. "
" Star-rider... (rider-RIDER)
... take me to the stars. "
" Star-rider... (rider-RIDER)
... show me where you are! "
" Northern Lights flash by... and then they were gone...
And the old stars were dying... so the new ones were born."
" Ever on our own... celestial ways...
And in the light of my years... shown the rest of my days. "
" Speed increasing, all control is in the hands of those who know! "
" Will they help us grow?... to one day peace - star*rider !!! "
" Star-rider... (rider-RIDER)
... show me where you are."
" Star-rider... (rider-RIDER)
... take me to the stars!"
