1 ContributorIntegrity LyricsI am not part of this
I have a flawless reputation
Confidential for one
Ask anyone
I don't belong here
I followed protocol
You can depend on me
I have integrity
You may have come this far
But we know who you are
You claim you're innocent
That's ignorant
We have evidence
You may have come this far
But we know who you are
You claim you're innocent
That's impertinent
We have evidence
How can you say that it's not true?
How can you claim that this ain't you?
I focus inward
I sense the hum
The sound of my life
The sound of my nights
You might also likeEvery beat is
Like the first
So fresh that it hurts
So fresh it hurts
You may have come this far
But we know who you are
You claim you're innocent
That's ignorant
We have evidence
You may have come this far
But we know who you are
You claim you're innocent
That's impertinent
We have evidenceEmbed
