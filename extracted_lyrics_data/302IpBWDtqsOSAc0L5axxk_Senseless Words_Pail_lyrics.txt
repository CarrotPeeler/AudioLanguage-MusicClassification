1 ContributorHip Hop Forever Lyrics
Hip hop's kept me sane through the strain and the strife
The cocaine in my veins through the painfulest nights
Can't explain how I've changed, how it's saved me in life
Now exchange what I've gained, I'm a sage on the mic
Need to run away, don't know where should I begin
The walls are closing in, I'm alone with my sins
My demons within, they chasing me down
Seeking my weakness, ain't breaking me now
I'm looking at my whole past, wishing I could go back
Know what I know now, change up my old path
Maybe I would be more, blown like C-4
I'm paying my dues, hope this a detour
I'm high as the sky and deep as the sea floor
My hues are the blues,  black sheep, I've weeped more
Remedy's a melody, if I ever cry
'73 like heaven be, hip hop'll never die

I could never sell out, but I want to see a grand
So I can feed my fam with the proceeds from my jams
Time, money been invested, and I wonder if it's senseless?
Fail at rapping, what'll happen? Am I really wreckless?
Such a fucking sacrifice, but life's a chance so pass the dice
And even though the deck is stacked, I won't lose, bet on that
Write a scripture with my words, paint a picture with some verbs
Action with my passion, mic assassin with curves
I'm here to figure out what my purpose on this earth is
Been wasting all this time, barely scratched the surface
I can't be wasting my potential, gotta do what I was meant to
Take a trip into my mental, as I ride the instrumental
Landed on this planet, rather be amongst the stars
Find my place in outer space, life is more than blunts and cars
Fuck greed, all I need, when I'm all alone
Lyrics in my spirit, the only place I call my homeYou might also likeEmbed
