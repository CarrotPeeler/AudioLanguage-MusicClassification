4 ContributorsD.J. D.J. Lyrics
D.J.!  D.J.!

Nobody move
Nobody get hurt, they said
Make one wrong move, man
You'll wake up dead
I exercise my lyrical style instead
All the while; you're dead, and gone, and forgotten
I said, awh - are they gonna come back for you?
Naw.  Ah, the story's sorry, but true
Lord, if you really want him to go
No. Oh you're so goddamn cold

We're gonna make it on our own
We don't need anyone
Lord knows we don't need you
Yeah
We're gonna make it on our own
We don't need anyone
Lord knows we don't need you
Yeah
(Watch me now)
You might also like
You got your ear to the street, then this Bud's for you
You got my name in your mouth, then this slug's for you
Shotgun, fast lane, on the highway to hell
Sherm sticks, tall cans, and the powder that sells
Just tryna have somethin
And you sit back and laugh
I'mma grab somethin
I'mma get in that ass
We came too far now, no way we'll get fucked
Wanna drop me, gotta kill me, only way I'mma stop

We got 808 subwoofers in the trunk
Around the world with the Rancid Punx
This is for the misfits, the freaks, and the runts
Fuck the motherfuckin backstabbin cunts
Ride's gettin rough, so I know I better buckle
P-U-N-X tattooed on my knuckles
Hey man, you keep the shackles
Cause I am free

We're gonna make it on our own
We don't need anyone
Lord knows we don't need you
Yeah
We're gonna make it on our own
We don't need anyone
Lord knows we don't need you
(Watch me now)

We're gonna make it on our own
We don't need anyone
Lord knows we don't need you
Yeah
We're gonna make it on our own
We don't need anyone
Lord knows we don't need you

I heard you're losing your mind
Shit, I been lost mine
But I still stay focused, through good and bad times
Compare your worst fuckin day to my best fuckin night
Bet my last red cent that you couldn't stand the sight
From loss of loved ones, to life of drug funds
They counted me out, from what? I'm not done
Gimme a chance to shine, and I'mma blind the world
Take a stand and be the voice of those who cannot be heard

We're gonna make it on our own
We don't need anyone
Lord knows we don't need you
Yeah
We're gonna make it on our own
We don't need anyone
Lord knows we don't need you
(Watch me now)2Embed
