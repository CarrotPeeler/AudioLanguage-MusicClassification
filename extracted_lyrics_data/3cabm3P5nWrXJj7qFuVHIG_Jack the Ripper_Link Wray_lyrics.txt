See the view come up in site
Feel it’s all falling in line
Cross my fingers, count my luck
Pray a nigga don’t get stuck
Feel the doubts I start to fright
Steady your thoughts bro grow some spine
You choose this path you want that life
Got quite a few believing
I see you Gees I’m coming
Final touches on the house yea they being put
Loki (lowkey) got me feeling like a god no mischief I do not deceive
Feeling one hell of a raper like I’m jack
The ripper with it way that I shred it and kill it and slit it again and again and again
