4 ContributorsTwo Step Too Lyrics
Now, I been all around this old town
Lookin' for a woman like you
Somebody I can talk to
About the things that I like to do
Now, I like to have a good time
And I know you do too
I like to listen to rock and roll
But, honey, I like a two-step too

Well, there's a damn good band at Jack's place
Playin' music from New Orleans
They got a dude on the bass guitar
Beats anything I've ever seen
They even do some James Brown
We can dance to the boogaloo
I like to listen to rock and roll
But, honey, I like a two-step too

Yeah, I like a two-step too
Whatever you wanna do
I know a funky little juke joint
Where we can listen to some low-down blues
Now, I like to have a good time
And honey, I know you do
I like to listen to rock and roll
But I like a two-step too
You might also like
Now, I won't let you go hungry
Honey, I aim to please
I got a glove box full of coupons
Good for a drink and a Krystal Cheese
It don't matter to me, baby
I just wanna be with you
I like to listen to rock and roll
But, honey, I like a two-step too

I like a two-step too
Whatever you wanna do
I know a funky little juke joint
Where we can listen to some low-down blues
Well, I like to have a good time
And, honey, I know you do
I like to listen to rock and roll
But, honey, I like a two-step too

I like to listen to rock and roll
But, honey, I like a two-step tooEmbed
