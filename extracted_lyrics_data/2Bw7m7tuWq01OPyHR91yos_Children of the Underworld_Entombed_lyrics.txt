2 ContributorsChildren Of The Underworld LyricsWe rise from the ashes we burn
With a grin on our face we return
We walk among the ones
The mortals can't see
When the sun goes up
No more we'll be
Soulless we hide in the shadows
Lifeless we hide from the sun
We are the children of the underworld
And we are gone
We stalk the earth we are undead
By the fullmoon's curse we are possessed
Doomed to eternity
We suffer we cry
Bleeding endless floods
When we conquer your lives
With blood our thirst has been stilled
With flesh our stomachs are filled
We are children of the underworld
And we kill
We repent nothing
We cheat and we lie
We manipulate your soul
We bleed and you die
Fearless we walk among demons
Godless we take your last breath
We are children of the underworld
And we're undeadYou might also likeEmbed
