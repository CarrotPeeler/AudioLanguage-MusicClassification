1 ContributorLonesome Place LyricsThey took me out to some lonesome place
They asked: “do you believe in the great white race?”
I said: “Mister, to tell you the truth
I’d believe in anything if you if just turn me loose”
Turn, turn, turn me loose
The white man said “boy, can it be-
You’re standing there slandering me?”
Turn, turn, turn me loose
Do you see my skin or silhouette?
I only see love in my bed
They hit me in the head and then they knocked me down
And then they hit me right there on the ground
And a Klansmen said: “nigga
Look me in the face, now tell me you believe
In the great white race
Turn, turn, turn me loose
Do you see my skin or silhouette?
I only see love in my bed
Southern woman now don’t you swoon
They just hung your Blackman in the light of the moon
They’ve hung him there from some cedar tree
They like to hang them high
They like to watch men bleed
You know Dixie protects its white womanhood
So, Southern belle you be good
You be good, you be good

I only see love in my bedEmbed
