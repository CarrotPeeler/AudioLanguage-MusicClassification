3 ContributorsFatima Lyrics
It's like we're on the same book, different chapter
Like we watched the same movie but with different actors
Cause we got the same feelings, it's just different actions
And I tried to put the flame out
You just watched our love burn to ashes
Cause you're scared of what would happen if we went back
I saw you as the one but you saw me as a setback
So I took a step back and I regret that
I sent you a mеssage, can you check that?

She don't want hashish, shе wants argeela
She my little queen, call her Fatima
Hold my crown for me, be my little keeper
Hold it down for me, girl you know I need ya
She don't want hashish, she wants argeela
She my little queen, call her Fatima
Hold my crown for me, be my little keeper
Hold it down for me, girl you know I need ya

She don't want no weed, she'd rather smoke shisha
She my little queen, I call her Fatima
Put her in the passenger side of the Beema
If she holds me down then she could be my keeper
Skip past the fake love like it's VBV
Blocked me on the Gram so I had to send you a Tweet
Baby I'm the man, I put grands into BTC
Never used to ask for handouts, I don't need 'em, ease up
As a young'un I was used to stealing shit
And now we rising like the ceiling did
And why you stepping with him when you know you ain't feeling him?
The car parks by itself like it's got a jinn in it
Brown skin, little cutie, call her Cinnamon
I want Fatima, Alisha and Hiba
Take you all out just for some argeela
And don't tell your abu, I won't tell him either
£100K mehr, she can't cook or clean up
You might also like
She don't want hashish, she wants argeela
She my little queen, call her Fatima
Hold my crown for me, be my little keeper
Hold it down for me, girl you know I need ya
She don't want hashish, she wants argeela
She my little queen, call her Fatima
Hold my crown for me, be my little keeper
Hold it down for me, girl you know I need yaEmbed
