A change comes on my eyes
These streets persuading me
With mumbles, strange goodbyes
And through the water
Through the ring
To the soul of everything
Throw my heart out
On the stones
And I’m almost gone
And there’s no meaning
In clothes and coffee cups
Cheap hotel furniture
Where silence never stops
And through the water
Through the ring
To the soul of everything
Throw my heart out
On the stones
And I’m almost gone
And now I’m dreaming
I’m staring at the walls
At cars all frozen now
In late night waterfalls

Through the ring
To the soul of everything
Throw my heart out
On the stones
And I’m almost
Through the water
Through the ring
To the soul of everything
Wash my heart out
On the stones
And I’m almost goneEmbed
