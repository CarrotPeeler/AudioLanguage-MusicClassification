11 ContributorsTrain of Thought Lyrics
Jump on my train, yeah, my little train of thought
Dip your tongue, yeah, into my honey pot
I know what I have; do you know what you got?
Jump on my train, yeah, my little train of thought
The season's shifting, yeah, from cool to hot
Oh, jump on my train, yeah, my little train, my train of thought

(Hoo-hoo)

The famous people, yeah, they go out looking proud
They're standing right in front a big and lonely crowd
The famous people, they got their demons
I got my demons, but in me she's believing
Hey, famous people, step on my train
We'll make a movie and it will be the real thing
