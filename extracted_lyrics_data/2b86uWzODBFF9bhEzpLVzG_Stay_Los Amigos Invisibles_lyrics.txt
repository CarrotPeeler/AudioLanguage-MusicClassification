Strong as a mountain, my fortress of care
Now that you're old, you're tired and weak
I'll let you my shoulder, there's no need to weep
You can't be gone
You have to stay here to listen to my heart, to vanish my fears
Just stay, stay, stay a little longer (just stay)
There's a world out there that never made
It through your eyes (just stay)
Your heart, heart, heart is so much stronger than mine
You've got to find a way, find a way back
I know it's hard to suffer the strength of
Living your whole life witholding the pain
Please rest was the one, recover your will
Remember the good years you gave us to keep
You can't be gone, you have to stay here
To listen to my heart, to vanish my fears
Just stay, stay, stay a little longer (just stay)
There's a world out there that never made it
Through your eyes (just stay)
Your heart, heart, heart is so much stronger than mine
You've got to find a way, find a way back
