4 ContributorsPoem: How to Break a Heart LyricsHow to break a heart
It is not difficult
Anyone can do it
So could you
If you tried
Just find a light
And switch it off
As easy
As blinking
That's what I was taught
When I was too young to ask
By ladies
In white nightgowns
In dripping weeds
And black ribbons
A girl's best friend
Is a small handgun
The question was useless
For I could say yes
But you've got to ask my army
And they are not inclined to grant favours
