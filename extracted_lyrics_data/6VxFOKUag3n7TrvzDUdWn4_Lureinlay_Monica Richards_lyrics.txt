1 ContributorLureinlay LyricsI was sinking
Long have I dwelt o'er the
Realm of the Drowning Man
Still I was empty...
Long have they been dashed against my shores
Still I was waiting...
And to my wat'ry depths they sadly sank
And I was sinking
I put them all to sleep
One touch of my voice
Then dead at my feet
It was nothing...
In the early hours
A grey dawn misty morn
The turning tide
Surveyed with flooding eyes
The sky breaking through
The morning silent
And yet I hear the sound
The faintest beat
Of heart that sank itself
Beneath my waves
There was something...
I realize I'm nothing like my kind
Your heart is still beating
You might also likeKeep your heart alive I'm almost there
Keep your heart alive and I'll bring you home
You better sing out strong
You've got a voice that melts the glaciers down
Keep your heart alive I'm almost there
Keep yourself alive and I'll bring you homeEmbed
