I'll have a shower
And then phone my brother up
Within the hour
I'll smash another cup
Please don't start saying that
Or I'll start believing you
If I start believing you
I'll know that this party fears two

And
What if this party fears two
The alcohol loves you
While turning you blue
View it from here
From closer to near
Awake me

Don't turn around
I won't have to look at you
And what's not found
Is all that I see in you
My manners are failing me
I'm left feeling ugly
And you say it's wonderful
To live with I never will
You might also like
So
What if this party fears two
The alcohol loves you
While turning you blue
View it from here
From closer to near
Awake me

I'm standing still
And you say I dress too well
Still standing still
I might but it's hard to tell
Even a slight remark
Makes nonsense and turns to shock
Have I done something wrong
What's wrong's the wrong that's always been wrong

I'll have a shower
And then phone my brother up
Within the hour
I'll smash another cup1Embed
