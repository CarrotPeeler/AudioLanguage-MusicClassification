1 ContributorSave Me LyricsSpoken: I got me here the one-string diddly-bo, custom-made for me personally by a super-chicken
Save me, from this way
It be, killing me
Yeah I been sitting here dreaming
Yea one day, of being free
Save me, save me, save me, oh save me
Save me, from this girl
She be, killing me
I been sitting here dreaming
Yea one day, of being free
Save me, save me, who gonna save me? Yea save me
Save me, from this song
It be boring me
I been sitting here dreaming
Yea one day, of being free
Save me, save me, who gonna save me, save me yea, save me, who gonna save me, baby hang on, save me, hang on, save me...yea gonna save me, who gonna save me, yea but who gonna save me, oh who gonna save me...diddly-boYou might also likeEmbed
