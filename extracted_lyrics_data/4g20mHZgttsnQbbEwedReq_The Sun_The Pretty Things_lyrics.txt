2 ContributorsThe Sun LyricsThe sun
The sun will cross the sky
Cross the sky
You reach out
You reach out
But it's too high
It's too high
Will you settle?
Will you settle?
Will you settle?
Will you settle?
Will you settle for that water touched by land?
Water touched by land
When the sun has passed you by
Passed you by
In the dark
In the darkness
You will cry
You will cry
And your tears
And your tears
And your tears
And your tears
And your tears will be soaked up by the sun
Soaked up by the sun
You might also likeIt's been my fault
Yes, mine from the start
If I told you
I've never fallen so hard
So hard
Yes
It's been that for
The sun
The sun has passed you by
Passed you by
In the dark
In the darkness
You will cry
And your tears
And your tears
And your tears
And your tears
And your tears
And your tears will be soaked up by the sun
Soaked up by the sun
Touching on the land
Soaked up by the sunEmbed
