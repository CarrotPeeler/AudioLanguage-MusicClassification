15 ContributorsHer and Her Friend Lyrics
I think it's funny how you could find yourself alone
With someone else in an ideal situation
Without a shred of good intentions between you
Much less a decent explanation
I couldn't tell you why she summoned me
Sometimes you get lucky
And they think that you were someone else
I can't remember what she said
Was she trying to tell me something
Or talking to herself?

Go upstairs don't close the door
Why don't you give her what she's asking for?
Spill the drink onto the bed
That's just between her and her friend

But it made it hard to sleep
'Til her head felt even worse
And I hope that she felt miserable
When it was time to go to work
Her and her friend
Just did it as revenge
So any excess pain you feel
Isn't any consequence
But don't feel bad
'Cause you didn't stand a chance
You can make a hasty exit
That's how they handle it in France
Little consolation
Even if you always knew it
So any nasty things I say
Are purely therapeutic
You might also like
Go upstairs don't close the door
Why don't you give her what she's asking for?
Spill the drink onto the bed
That's just between her and her friend
Close the door, leave on the light
And kiss her for a little while
The liquor soaked into the sheets
She said, "It's getting late, you'd better leave"

I'm not budging until you tell me why
Please, go
Not until you look me straight in the eye and tell me why
Go away and never come back again
Go away, please, go away
Go away, please, go away...1Embed
