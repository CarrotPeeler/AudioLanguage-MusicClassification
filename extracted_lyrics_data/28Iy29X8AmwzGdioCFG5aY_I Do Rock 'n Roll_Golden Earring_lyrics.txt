Can't help it
Can't fight it
Nothing I can do without it

You're sorry you met me
Tomorrow you miss me
Tomorrow I'll kiss you goodbye
You're sorry you met me
Tomorrow you miss me
Tomorrow I'll kiss you goodbye
You can tell me why

I do rock 'n' roll...
You're sorry you met me
Tomorrow you miss me
Tomorrow I'll kiss you goodbye (2x)
You can tell me why
Tell me why

Anything that you wanna do (3x)
We'll do it tonight, all night
Anything that you wanna do (3x)
It's all for you
