What did i see a brand new image
Of the same old me ohhhh
But now i wonder why should i be surprised
I like the things about me
I like the things about me
I like the things about me
I like the things about me that i once despised
There was a time
When i wished my hair was fine
And i can remember when
I wished my lips were thin
Oh but now i wonder why should i be surprised
I like the things about me
I like the things about me
I like the things about me
I like the things about me that i once despised
(solo section)
I like the things about me
I like the things about me
I like the things about me
I like the things about me that i once despised
Makes no difference now y’all
How you may feel
I’ve done reached the point
Where i wanna be real
I’m tired of living living in disguise
I like the things about me
I like the things about me
I like the things about me
I like the things about me that i once despised
I like the things about me
I like the things about me
I like the things about me
I like the things about me that i once despised
I like the things about me
I like the things about me
I like the things about me
I like the things about me that i once despisedSee Mavis Staples LiveGet tickets as low as $105You might also likeEmbed
