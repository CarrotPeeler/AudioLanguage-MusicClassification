1 ContributorPeople Get Ready LyricsPeople get ready
There's a train a comin'
You don't need no baggage you just get on board
All you need is faith
To hear the diesel comin'
Don't need no ticket you just thank the Lord
People get ready
For the train to Jordan
Picking up passengers from coast to coast
Faith is key
Open up the doors and board them
There's hope for all among the love the most
There ain't no room for the hopeless sinner
Who would hurt all mankind just to save his own
Have pity on those whose choices grow thinner
There ain't no hiding place from the Kingdom's throne
People get ready
There's a train a comin'
You don't need no baggage you just get on board
All you need is faith
To hear the diesel comin'
Don't need no ticket you just thank the Lord
