1 ContributorThings I Want to Tell You LyricsRoll me over on my right side
Roll me over slow
Roll me over on my right side
My left side hurts me so
I'm what you left behind
I'm fading from your mind
I'm what you left behind
I'm fading from your mind
There are things I want to tell you
I no longer tell you
Ways I want to hold you gone to waste
It's harder in the evenings
Waiting for the phone rings
(The hollow thump of life that has no taste)
I'm what you left behind
I'm fading from your mind
I'm what you left behind
I'm fading from your mind
Roll me overYou might also likeEmbed
