3 ContributorsAurora Lyrics
Could I be your light
When you are afraid?
Could I be the reason
When you're asking why?
I could be a mistress
For your lonely nights
I would give you wings
I am the gateway
To another life
You are on your way
To a better place

Descending weight
Aroused by the warmth
Like a moth circles the lantern
You are calling us like a drug
Like a drug
Everything is covered in white
You can hear the silence
Your heart stopped beating
But you still keep walking
You might also likeFeeling lighter than air
You are one with the sky
Now you understand
You are a frozen star

Lower your armour
Release the pain
Cry like a newborn
You are free again
There is no violence
In surrounding darkness
There are no laws
In this chaos of colours
In this chaos of colours

This weary burden
Of eternal winter
Fading away
Aurora
This weary burden
Of eternal winter
Fading away
Aurora
This weary burden
Of eternal winter
Fading away
Aurora
This weary burden
Of eternal winter
Fading away
AuroraEmbed
