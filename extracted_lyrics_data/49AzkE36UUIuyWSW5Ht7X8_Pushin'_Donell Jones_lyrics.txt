2 ContributorsPushin’ Lyrics
You just keep on pushin'
You won't let it go away
You've got my mind thinking
We won't see another day
If you keep on reaching and stressing me
You might just push me away, hey

Girl, you've always got some drama going on
Somebody told me that they saw you in an ex-man's arms
Kissing and laughing, passions splashing Alizé
And you caught an attitude when I asked you what you had to say
Don't get it twisted, 'cause I catch it on the low
But you got me open like I've never been before
You come home late at night, I'm chillin' with my friends
Then comes an argument
You got me thinking about leaving you again

You just keep on pushin'
You won't let it go away
You've got my mind thinking
We won't see another day
If you keep on reaching and stressing me
You might just push me away, hey
You might also like
Nothing is easy when it comes to loving you
I know you're not feeling me the way that you used to
And now that I'm flossin', tossin' ice all on my wrist
You wanna run back to me, but it's so hard to forget
I took you shopping, trickin' your G's up at the mall
Whenever I page you, lady, you don't return my calls
I don't wanna playa hate, but, girl, it's not a game
I can't take you serious so I gotta get away, away

You just keep on pushin'
You won't let it go away
You've got my mind thinking
We won't see another day
If you keep on reaching and stressing me
You might just push me away, hey

Girl, you've been acting strange from the door
And I should let you know
This right here ain't yours no more
So stop blowing up my pager
Calling, acting like a stranger
Calling me, pushing me away, yeah
You just keep on pushin'
You won't let it go away
You've got my mind thinking
We won't see another day
If you keep on reaching and stressing me
You might just push me away
(Said you just might push me away) Hey
You just keep on pushin'
(What am I gonna do wit' you, baby?)
You won't let it go away
You've got my mind thinking
(What am I gonna do wit' you, lady?)
We won't see another day
If you keep on reaching and stressing me
You might just push me away
(Said you just might push me away) Hey
You just keep on pushin'
(What am I gonna do wit' you, baby?)
You won't let it go away
You've got my mind thinking
(What am I gonna do wit' you, lady?)
We won't see another day
If you keep on reaching and stressing me
You might just push me away
(Away) Hey (Away)
You just keep on pushin'
You won't let it go away
You've got my mind thinking
We won't see another day
If you keep on reaching and stressing me
You might just push me away
(Away) Hey (Away, oh yeah)
You've got my mind, yeah
If you keep on reaching and stressing me
Away, heyEmbed
