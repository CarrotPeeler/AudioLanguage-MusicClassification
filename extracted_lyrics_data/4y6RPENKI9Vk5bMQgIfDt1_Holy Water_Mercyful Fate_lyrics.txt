I don't want that holy water, it makes me burn
I don't want that holy water, I guess I'll never learn
I'd rather drink from the Devil's well and then I'll go to Hell
I'd rather drink from the Devil's well and then I will go straight to Hell
Oh yeah

High on the mountain of Poltersberg, there is a quiet lake
They say it's full of demons, that Satan keeps them there
Wash away your darkest sins, if that's what you believe
But keep in mind that if you do, who is it you deceive?

Cast a stone into this lake and soon a storm will rise
And suck out all the demons, up into the sky
Wash away your darkest sins, if that's what you believe
But keep in mind that if you do, who is it you deceive?


Ohh, holy water
Ohh, holy water

I don't want that holy water, it makes me burn
I don't want that holy water, I guess I'll never learn
I'd rather drink from the Devil's well and then I'll go to Hell
I'd rather drink from the Devil's well and then I will go straight to Hell
Oh yeah

Deep in the valley of Blankenstein, there is a sacred pool
They say that you can drink this water, it's cleansing of the soul
Wash away your darkest sins, if that's what you believe
But keep in mind that if you do, who is it you deceive?

I don't want that holy water, no, no, no, no, no
It makes me burn inside
I don't want that holy water, oh no
