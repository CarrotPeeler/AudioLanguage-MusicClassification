Jack go under the limbo stick
Old King Cole had a whole lot of soul
Couldn’t slide under the limbo pole
The limbo, the limbo
I told him once I told him twice
Never do the limbo if you can’t do it right
Sly, gotta be sly, when the stick is high
Put your hands on your hips and let your ankle ride
Gotta limbo, gotta limboYou might also likeEmbed
