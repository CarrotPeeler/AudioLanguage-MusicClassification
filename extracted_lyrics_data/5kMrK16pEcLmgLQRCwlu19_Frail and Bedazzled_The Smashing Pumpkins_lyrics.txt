8 ContributorsFrail and Bedazzled Lyrics
Say, now listen here
I wanna be oh so clear
I lost myself, and lost I'll stay
Between my friends and my malaise

And here I am, frail
Frail and bedazzled from all the glare

Tug at my sleeve
My little girl, my sweet Marie
She don't know how bad I am
Stole my smile from a cheshire cat

And all I wanted
Was to be happy
And since I've gave up
I feel free
I feel free
I feel free
I feel free

Two of us less dangerous
It's all inside our heads
Givin' in for nothin' less
Leavin' me for you
You might also like
Try to understand
The ones I love and their demands
It's so unfair when they can't see
That I'm the boy that really needs

Their love has failed
Frail and bedazzled from all the
Frail and bedazzled from all the
Frail and bedazzled from all the glare2Embed
