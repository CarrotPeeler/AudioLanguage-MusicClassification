5 ContributorsUntil the Real Thing Comes Along Lyrics
I'd work for you, I'd slave for you
I'd be a beggar or a knave for you
If that isn't love, it will have to do
Until the real thing comes along

I'd gladly move the earth for you
To prove my love, dear, and its worth for you
If that isn't love, it'll have to do
Until the real thing comes along

With all the words, dear, at my command
I just can't make you understand
I'll always love you, darling, come what may
My heart is yours, what more can I say?

I'd lie for you, I'd sigh for you
I'd tear the stars down from the sky for you
If that isn't love, it will have to do
Until the real thing comes along

With all the words, dear, at my command
I just can't make you understand
I'll always love you, darling, come what may
My heart is yours, what more can I say?
You might also like
I'd lie for you, I'd cry for you
I'd lay my body down and die for you
If that isn't love, it will have to do
Until the real thing comes alongEmbed
