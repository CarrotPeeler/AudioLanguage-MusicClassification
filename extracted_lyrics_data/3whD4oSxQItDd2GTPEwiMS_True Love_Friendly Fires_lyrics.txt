3 ContributorsTrue Love LyricsRepetitious streetlights guide me home
I walk the pavements back to mine alone
I keep on wanting your lies
As you live your life a moment just passed on by
I watch the lovers collide
And my envy ignited
I'd give it all just to feel what it's like
All I want is to feel true love
All I want is to feel true love
All I want is to feel true love
All I want is to feel true love
I check the figures
It feels like hope is lost
A photographic film I cut the cord
I keep chasing my lie
That you live your life a moment just passed me by
If I had luck on my side
I'd give it all just to have what they have
But it's never enough
All I want is to feel true love
All I want is to feel true love
All I want is to feel true love
All I want is to feel true love
You might also likeWatch you fall through my fingers
Watch you fall into space
Watch you fall through my fingers
Watch you fall into space
All I want is to feel true love
All I want is to feel true love
All I want is to feel true love
All I want is to feel true loveEmbed
