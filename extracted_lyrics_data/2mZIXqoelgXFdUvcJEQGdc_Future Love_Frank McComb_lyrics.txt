2 ContributorsFuture Love LyricsLooking in the mirror of my past viewing how things
Used to be
Lonely is the word to best describe what I see
Sadness, stress and salty tears covered every part of
My face
Until our love had fallen into place
It's amazing though that I had to go through
To become mature enough to know
That love didn't love me
Looking in the mirror thinkin' 'bout my future
Wondering what it's gonna bring
Will it be happy or sad for me?
If I could control what's to come I would add to my
Future a love
So faithful& dots unconditional
She'll be my only love
And finally happiness would be headed toward me
But presently I'll deal with my reality
The present is the only thing I know
And to my future love is where I'm trying to go
It's amazing to know that I've gotta still go through
Some things to grow
To learn to love the one that's gonna love meYou might also likeEmbed
