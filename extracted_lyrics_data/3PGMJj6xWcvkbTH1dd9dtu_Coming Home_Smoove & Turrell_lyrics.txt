1 ContributorComing Home LyricsSpread out at our feet
A road that has no end
Sometimes cold and lonely
Sometimes hard to lose a friend
If all ends up for nothing
Nothing ain’t gonna pay
But we’ll all just keep on walking
Drop our feet and hope to say
I’m coming home, hold on to the light
If you’re feeling what I’m feeling
Then you know it’s gonna be alright
Hold onto the blister, baby, hold onto the pain
I’m coming home, it’ll never be the same
I’m coming home
File right in to line
Tread the road you're gonna take
You’ll never stop the feeling
You missed the turn, you missed the brake
Hear that call for home time
Don’t you stop or hesitate
Just run along now baby
This thing, it cannot wait
Baby don’t stop 'til you’re gone
You might also likeI’m coming home, hold on to the light
If you’re feeling what I’m feeling
Then you know it’s gonna be alright
Hold onto the blister, baby, hold onto the pain
I’m coming home, it’ll never be the same
I’m coming home
You work, you just keep walking
You laugh, you start to run
You stop and you’re in trouble
You don’t pause until you’re done
You wait it’s all for nothing
And pray it just don’t work
Drop right to your knees and feel the darkness from above
Baby I’ll stop when I’m done
Whoah, oh, oh
I’m coming home, hold on to the light
If you’re feeling what I’m feeling
Then you know it’s gonna be alright
Hold onto the blister, baby, hold onto the pain
I’m coming home, it’ll never be the same
I’m coming home, hold on to the light
If you’re feeling what I’m feeling
Then you know it’s gonna be alright
Hold onto the blister, baby, hold onto the pain
I’m coming home, it’ll never be the same
I’m coming homeEmbed
