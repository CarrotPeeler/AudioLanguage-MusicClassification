Baby, I, I wanna know
What you think when you're alone
Is it me, yeah?
Are you thinking of me, yeah? Oh
We've been friends now for a while
Wanna know that when you smile
Is it me, yeah?
Are you thinking of me, yeah? Oh, oh

Girl, what would you do?
Would you wanna stay
If I were to say?

I wanna be last, yeah
Baby, let me be your, let me be your last first kiss
I wanna be first, yeah
Wanna be the first to take it all the way like this
And if you only knew
I wanna be last, yeah
Baby, let me be your last
Your last first kiss

Baby, tell me what to change
I'm afraid you'll run away
If I tell you
What I've wanted to tell you, yeah
Maybe I just gotta wait
Maybe this is a mistake
I'm a fool, yeah
Baby, I'm just a fool, yeah, oh, oh
You might also like
Girl, what would you do?
Would you wanna stay
If I were to say?

I wanna be last, yeah
Baby, let me be your, let me be your last first kiss
I wanna be first, yeah
Wanna be the first to take it all the way like this
And if you only knew
I wanna be last, yeah
Baby, let me be your last
Your last first kiss

(Your last first kiss)
Your last first kiss
(Your last first kiss)

Girl, what would you do?
Would you wanna stay
If I were to say?
Your last first kiss
I wanna be last, yeah
Baby, let me be your, let me be your last first kiss
I wanna be first, yeah
Wanna be the first to take it all the way like this
And if you only knew (Yeah!)
I wanna be last, yeah
Baby, let me be your last
Your last first kiss

I wanna be last, yeah
Baby, let me be your last
Your last first kiss (Your last first kiss), oh
I wanna be last, yeah
Baby, let me be your last
Your last first kiss8Embed
