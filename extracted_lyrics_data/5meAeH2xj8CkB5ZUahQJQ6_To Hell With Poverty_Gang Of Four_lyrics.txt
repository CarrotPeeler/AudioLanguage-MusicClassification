13 ContributorsTo Hell With Poverty! Lyrics
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh

In my arms
We shall begin
With none of the rocks
Well there's no charge
In this land right now
Some are insane, and they're in charge

To hell with poverty
We'll get drunk on cheap wine

To hell with poverty
The check will arrive
It's in the post again
To hell with poverty
The check will arrive
It's in the post again
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh

In my arms
We shall begin
With none of the rocks
And there's no charge
In this land right now
Some are insane, and they're in charge

To hell with poverty
We'll get drunk on cheap wine
To hell with poverty

Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
