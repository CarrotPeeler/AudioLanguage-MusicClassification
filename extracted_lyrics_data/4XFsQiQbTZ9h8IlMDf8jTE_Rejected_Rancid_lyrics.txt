7 ContributorsRejected LyricsI could not fit in
I was the one who got caught
I was the one who got realized
I was the one who got dropped
Shut out, banished and locked away
The knife that did me in I carry to this day
Rejected
Rejected
Crossing bridges in the land of the forgotten
Rejected
I could not fit in
I was the one who got caught
I was the one who got realized
I was the one who got dropped
Distrust existed that I never saw
Deep seated trust I was a victim of
Rejected
Rejected
Crossing bridges in the land of the forgotten
Rejected
Unspoken among the more privileged or the so called
I was not good enough, not good enough at all
At first out of loneliness I tried to conform
But all that bullshit just left me all alone
You might also likeLeft me all alone, yeah
