3 ContributorsThe Mountain LyricsAll you feel and you taste
And you wanna go higher so what do you do?
And so you peek into the mountain where your desire goes
Spilled blood on this place
It only echoes true all through the days
And so you peek into the mountain where your desire goes
Oh, havin' the space to know
The weight is coming down
Take it on down the line
Oh, yeah, havin' the space to know
The weight is coming down
Take it on down the line
It's hard to get ahead when the center is bleedin'
And you tear out the middle and you send it all away
Tasteless lead sittinâ€™ on our tongues
And then we have to worry more about the ones we love
When you see the smoke, there's fire
When you see the smoke, there's fire
When you see the smoke, there's fire
When you see the smoke, there's fire
Oh, havin' the space to know
The weight is coming down
Take it on down the line
Oh, yeah, havin' the space to know
The weight is coming down
Take it on down the line

And you wanna go higher so what do you do?
And so you peek into the mountain where your desire goes
Spilled blood on this place
It only echoes true all through the days
And so you peek into the mountain where your desire goes
Oh, havin' the space to know
The weight is coming down
Take it on down the line
Oh, yeah, havin' the space to know
The weight is coming down
Take it on down the line2Embed
