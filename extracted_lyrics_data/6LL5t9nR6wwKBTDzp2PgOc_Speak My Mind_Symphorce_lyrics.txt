1 ContributorSpeak My Mind LyricsAs I walk through the ashes
I whisper your name
As your soul is torn apart
A beating of your heart
Into the depths of no return
Do what no-one has done
All my dreams I shared for you
How I wish they could come true
Do you hear me calling now
Another day unfolds, the rains are cold
Do you try to hide it somehow...
When I close my eyes I'll see inside
.. speak my mind
Lookin' for a way to stay
Stay away from my thoughts
The hunger in my stare
As I feed upon your fear
Do you hear me calling now
Another day unfolds, the rains are cold
Do you try to hide it somehow...
When I close my eyes I'll see inside
.. speak my mindYou might also likeEmbed
