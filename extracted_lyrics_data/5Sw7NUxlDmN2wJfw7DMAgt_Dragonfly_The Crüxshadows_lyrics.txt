Her voice fell tired and spent
My hopes and dreams, a silent heart
I carry here within
Her outstretched wings left tattered
A sail aged with rust
A breath in time that's yours and mine
It belongs to only us
And I will write her name and cast it to the sky
Silhouettes recede into a mother's tearful eyes
A host of angels clamor to her side
A light dissolves to kiss the wind
Release the dragonfly
See the rose within the field of white
She's searching for the grail
But the rain descends to snatch the light
From distant dying suns
A faint resounding in the night
Calls angels' wings to beat
Singing silent lip-sewn songs
But the distance is too deep

Silhouettes recede into a mother's tearful eyes
A host of angels clamor to her side
A light dissolves to kiss the wind
Release the dragonfly
And I will write her name and cast it to the sky
As precious moments will slip away in time
Angels fall from grace and sometimes heroes die
But tonight, my love, ascend the gates
Release the dragonfly
And I will write her name and cast it to the sky
Silhouettes recede into a mother's tearful eyes
A host of angels clamor to her side
A light dissolves to kiss the wind
Release the dragonfly
And I will write her name and cast it to the sky
As precious moments will slip away in time
Sometimes angels fall, but love will never die
Tonight my soul is something more
Calls the dragonflyEmbed
