1 ContributorThe Other Day LyricsYou can get them in the cd jacket..but if you don't have them here they are
The other day I saw your photograph
Looking into me
Don't want to think about it
Try to forget about it
But it never goes away
The other day I thought I saw you
In our favorite pplace
I had to get away
I wanted to run away
Everywhere I see your face
The other day I found all these things
You wanted me to know
Don't want to talk about it
Try not to think about it
Wish I could let it go
The other day I tried calling you
But you won't pick up the phone
Don't have to hang around
You always bring me down
I guess I'm all alone
Wish we could
Put it all
Behind us
Now and throw
Away the
Key wish we
Could unlock
Set us free
Find your key
Unlock my heart then we ca move on don't
Keep me let it be then I can let it go yeahYou might also likeEmbed
