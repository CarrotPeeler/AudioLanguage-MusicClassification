7 ContributorsI Want U 2 Vant Me Lyrics
I want you to want me
I need you to need me
I'm begging you to beg me
And I want you now

Yeah, I want you to want me, I need you to need me
I'm begging you to beg me, I'd love you to love me
Buy a brand new shirt, put on brand new shoes
I would do anything if you'd say that you love me

Didn't I, didn't I, didn't I see you crying?
Didn't I, didn't I, didn't I see you crying?
Sitting alone, I know you felt like dying
Didn't I, didn't I, didn't I see you crying?

I want you to want me, I need you to need me
I'm begging you to beg me, I'd love you to love me
Buy a brand new shirt, put on brand new shoes
I would do anything if you'd say that you love me

Didn't I, didn't I, didn't I see you crying?
Didn't I, didn't I, didn't I see you crying?
Sitting alone, I know you felt like dying
Didn't I, didn't I, didn't I see you crying?

And I want you now
Megan, she don't eat bacon
She'd never kill a sweet, little, innocent piggie to get bacon
She's one of them vegans
She's a sweet lovin', sweet talkin', lovable vegan
And that's alrightEmbed
