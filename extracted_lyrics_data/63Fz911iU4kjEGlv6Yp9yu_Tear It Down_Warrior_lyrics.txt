42 ContributorsA Day at the Races Lyrics
"Music p-pow-power!"
"Exclusive..."
(Yeah....)

Yo, my method for my musical madness
Move and motivate those with musical talents, uh
Read it in bold print, we holdin' it down
Lick a shot, Hip-Hop when we in yo' town
Uhh, master blaster sound
Freak the future far from here and now
With style, release increase the peace, uhh
Bubble with the beat 'til they feelin the heat in the streets
Now each one, teach one, reach one, young gun
On one, listen to the warrior's drum
Beatin' up the block with the ghetto hop that knock
And make you wanna crash the spot
And unlock, explode (BOOM!) the alpha and omega code
With drum rolls and old soul, we uphold
And foretold to scores of six years ago
Fast flow from G. Rap to Kool Moe
Super syllable, major to the minimal
Every individual bounce to the tempo, yo
Lungs collapse and raps be trapped in
The only way to make it happen, jaw-jappin', fast rappin'
You might also like
Yo, I'm the hot dog that rhyme the hottest monologue
Install poetic inserts and "yes y'all"s
My speech is like holding two Glocks apiece
The outreach that rock police
The super Avenger men, we tend to put somethin' adventurous in
When we write, the Emmy winner, get hype off any printer
And I came to get it, hit it
Like Operation PUSH, operate the tush
Black octopus of soul, an inter-planetary patrol
I planted my gold, and lo and behold
It's the brother Doc, ready to rock-rock
Don't stop Hobbes, I knock like the lumberjack chop chop
The wordsmith, I write in block letters of cursive
Curse will serve ya, surf this surface
And watch how the brother get over
The fly Cassanova with the frankincense odor

Bear witness
Them rare riches, to make career bitches share pictures
When they ears get this ya brains's software glitches
Splatter your brains
Leave scattered remains of matter and stains
That'll explain how you was battered and slain
I get rude and go, to your show and use your own
Fans to BOO and throw you off 'til you lose your flow
A pro, mean like Joe Greene when I blow steam
Put your whole team on Pond's like cold cream
They show laughter when I flow faster, your hoe have to
Go after her weave from the breeze when I blow past ya
I'm dapper, plus ghetto and just pedal
When the dust settle, we level the rubble and crush metal
Nurses with hearses sit and converse with lip purses
Pit fire, make it burst a bit, try me
Like Osama, or Dahmer, I'ma cause trauma
And homicides when I collide like a kamikaze
Kane, baby, walk hard through p-jects
On streets of Brooklyn I'm a crew of D-cepts
On streets of L.A., I'm a whole E-set
On tracks with Jurassic, I be the T-Rex
Still that Gucci dressin', still that coochie pressin'
My pimp game smooth, B gets 'em
I don't use discretion, Top 10's do be stressin'
Fuck explainin' it, who's he testin'?
Finsta perform all physical forms
Leave ya ass shakin' like a Mystikal song
Please, dunn, what type of shit was you on?
'Cause, man, to come press a nigga mean one less a nigga (Uh-huh)
All I want is my niggas all recruitin' a slimmy
All I want is my liver all polluted with Remy
Duel with any, bring it, I face-off
Son, you out your league like Jordan was with baseball

Yeahhh, your majesty, word flash photography
Third class economy, blade slashed your artery
Nerve gassed anatomy, blur past dramatically
Herbs hashed, my word splash packed agility
Never predictability
Manouvers of mind fully designed 'cause I'm true to the rhyme
We do the sublime, crackin' yo' backbone
Attackin' you wack clones
Vernacular right and exact, capital rap zone
That come back verbal assault rifle (Ahhhhh)
We fight like Stokely Carmichael – KNOW!
We just like you
We broke and ain't no tellin' what we might do – ain't no joke!
Revoke the right to reverse to seek mercy
With the King Asiatic and Percee P
Ain't heard the worst of me, until your chest 3-D
Spit venom and burn your body like a STD
Yo... put a 20 on the next brother steppin' to me wrong
I'll mess around and make his eulogy my theme song
This might seem wrong, but this is a mean song
Crush like King-Kong, and just like ping-pong
Back and forth, I spit Molotovs, it's time to floss
My verbal affirmation is to always go off
When syllables slide, you'll be enjoyin' the vibe
We consider it pride, it's J5
With another deadly medley, camera, action yo, we heavy
Aim steady, slash machete, Maserati engine ready
Good and plenty, don't be petty, count the fetti and we jetty
Off to another city where we do our nitty-gritty
We wild like Serengeti, tear it down let's Steve and Teddy
Get ready, for the ride, verbally hang-glide
Write and stay tight, mission's in sight
Murderin' worldwide, the stage is yo' knife7Embed
