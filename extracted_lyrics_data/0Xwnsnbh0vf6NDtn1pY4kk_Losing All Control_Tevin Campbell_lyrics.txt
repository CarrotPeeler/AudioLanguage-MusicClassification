4 ContributorsLosing All Control Lyrics
Think of it all the time
It's always on my mind
Losing all control
Of my heart and soul
Even when I close my eyes
The feeling never dies
Losing all control
Of my heart and soul

Slowly but surely
All control is leaving me
Seems as though my mind has gone astray
Can't stop thinking 'bout
How I just can't do without
I know I can not go on this way


Oh, I can't believe
All the things it does to me
Got me doing things it shouldn't be
You might also likeEverybody's telling me
About responsibility
Deep inside
I feel my soul at ease

But still
I can't stop
Thinking 'bout how I
Can't help the way I feel
Can't deny it takes control of me
