11 ContributorsIn a Lonely Place Lyrics
Caressing the marble and stone
Love that was special for one
Waste in the fever and heat
How I wish you were here with me now

Body that curls in and hides
Hardships that often belie
Warm like a dog round your feet
How I wish you were here with me now

Hangman looks round as he waits
Cord stretches tight then it breaks
Someday we will die in your dreams
How I wish you were here with you nowSee New Order LiveGet tickets as low as $139You might also like1Embed
