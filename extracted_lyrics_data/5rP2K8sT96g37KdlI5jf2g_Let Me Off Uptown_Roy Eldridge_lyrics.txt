Hey Joe
Whaddaya mean Joe?
My name ain't Joe, my name is Roy
Well, come here, Roy, and let's get groovy
Have you been uptown?
No, I've been to Hong Kong
Kowloon, Catania, Rome, Berlin, Paris, Zagreb
Let's see, Vienna, Venice, Oslo, Copenhagen, London
Well, I've been to Harrisburg, Pittsburgh
I've been to all the burgs
But Roy, I wanna know what's uptown
You do?

If it's pleasure you're about
And you feel like steppin' out
Just shout
Oh, let me off uptown

If you want to pitch a ball
And you can't afford a hall
Just shout
Oh, let me off uptown
You might also like
Rib joints
Juke joints
Hep joints
Where you gonna go to top it?

If it's rhythm that you feel
And you want to conceal
Just shout
Oh, let me off uptown

Anita, oh Anita
Say I feel somethin'
Whaddaya feel, Roy? The heat?
No, it ain't the heat
It must be that uptown rhythm 'cause I feel like blowin'
Well, blow Roy, blow
