Oh yeah

In France, skinny man
Died of a big disease with a little name
By chance his girlfriend came across a needle
Soon she did the same
At home there are seventeen year old boys
And their idea of fun is
Being in a gang called The Disciples
High on crack, toting a machine gun

Time
Hurricane Annie ripped the ceiling of a church
And killed everyone inside
You turn on the tele and every other story
Telling you somebody died
Sister killed her baby 'cause she could afford to feed it
They were sending rockets to the moon
September my cousin tried reefer for the very first time
Now he's doing horse, it's June

Time, time, yeah
See Chaka Khan LiveGet tickets as low as $182You might also like
It's silly, no?
When a rocket ship explodes
Everybody still want to fly
Some say a man ain't happy
Unless a man truly dies, oh why?

Time, time, time
Baby make a speech, star wars fly
Neighbors just shine it on
But if the night falls and a bomb falls
Then everybody sees dawn

Time, time

It's silly, no? When a rocket ship explodes
Everybody still wants to fly
Some say a man ain't happy, truly, yeah
Until he dies, oh why?

Time, time, time, time
Sign o' the times mess with your mind
Hurry before it's too late
Let's fall in love, get married, have a baby
We'll call him Nate, if it's a boy

Time, time
Everybody, yeah
(Oh, whoa, whoa)

Time, sign o' the times

Don't you know we can change the world?
Don't you know every boy and every girl
Deserves to live life, deserves a peace of mind?
