1 ContributorThe Day of the Humans Is Gone Lyrics
You're going down fast
You're way outta time
And for you the sun won't shine
You missed the boat
While you beat your meat
I'm going to break your mind
Out of the gutter
And into the streets
The day of the humans is gone
We'll laugh and sing
While we chew on your bones
And for you we sing this song (huh)

Rejoice, rejoice!
Raise all voices high!
Rejoice, rejoice!
Everyone will die!
Dissipate your flacid light
Snuff your candle out
Feeding on your energy
That's what we're all about

We've lived in your cells
For millions of years
We thank you for the ride
But parasites
Turn into rulers
And now we're comind outside
We change our form
We mutate at will
We're the best that can be found
We know how to survive
We lie and kill
We've got our program down (oh yeah)
You might also like
Rejoice, rejoice!
Raise all voices high!
Rejoice, rejoice!
Everyone will die!
Dissipate your flacid light
Snuff your candle out
Feeding on your energy
That's what we're all aboutEmbed
