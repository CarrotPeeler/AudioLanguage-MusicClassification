1 ContributorGive Me LyricsI wanna go out, but it's raining outside
And there's this thunder, there's this thunder
I want to get my bike and go where it's peace and quiet
But there's this thunder, there's this thunder
Rushing through my body, rushing through what's all of me
And you can tell me I am pretty, but I don't really care
And you can tell me I am lucky
But I don't listen on that ear
And you can tell me I'm like a spoiled kid
And I'll be angry but I won't hear
When you're just trying to get the thunder away from my head
There's a small black box somewhere inside and it's locked
I call it my thunder, it's my thunder
But when it comes out, oh I hate it so much
It's my thunder, It's the thunder
Rushing through my body, rushing through what's all of me
And you can tell me...You might also likeEmbed
