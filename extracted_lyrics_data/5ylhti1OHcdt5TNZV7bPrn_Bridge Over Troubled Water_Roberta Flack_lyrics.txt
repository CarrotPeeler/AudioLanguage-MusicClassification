3 ContributorsBridge Over Troubled Water Lyrics
When you're weary, feeling small
When tears are in your eyes, I'll dry them all
I'm on your side, when times get rough
And friends just can't, can't be found

Like a bridge over troubled waters
I will lay me down

When you're down and out
When you're on the street
When evening falls so hard
I will comfort you
And I'll take your part, when darkness comes
And pain is all, all around

Like a bridge over troubled waters
I will lay me down

Sail on, silver girl
Sail on by
Your time has come to shine
And all your dreams are on their way
See how they shine
If you need a friend
I'm sailing right, right behind
You might also like
Like a bridge over troubled waters
I will ease your mind
Like a bridge over troubled waters
I can ease, ease your mind
Like a bridge over troubled waters
I can ease your mindEmbed
