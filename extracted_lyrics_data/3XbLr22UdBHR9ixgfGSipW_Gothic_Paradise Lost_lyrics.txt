Frustrations tension eludes
The past was clean
When thoughts were mild
The present day horrors alive
Slowly passing timeless horrors
Lives within all fear
The mourning in my tears
Drown all the past
We've lived beneath these years
Awaiting for the call
For all life to expire
Passive to this day
To infinity we'll fall
The light is dim before us
Shadows appear and fall
A barrage of savage ways
Only the darkness can filter through
Awaiting for the call
For all life to expire
Passive to this day
To infinity we'll fall
Lives within all fear
The mourning in my tears
Drown all the past
We lived beneath these yearsSee Paradise Lost LiveGet tickets as low as $77You might also likeEmbed
