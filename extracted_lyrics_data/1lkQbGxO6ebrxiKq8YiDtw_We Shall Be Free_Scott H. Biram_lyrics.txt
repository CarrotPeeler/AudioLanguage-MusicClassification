1 ContributorWe Shall Be Free LyricsIn the morning we shall be free
All day we shall be free
Here me say it, we shall be free
You know the Good Lord will set you free
I was down in the henhouse the other night
Awful dark I didn't have no light
I reached for a chicken, I got me a goose
A man come out I had to turn him loose
He jumped a gullet
We shall be free
He jumped a shotgun
We shall be free
He jumped a roe foot
We shall be free
You know the Good Lord will set you free
The preacher and the rooster had a terrible fight
The preacher knocked the rooster clear out of sight
The preacher said to the rooster "It will be alright"
"I'll meet you at the henhouse tomorrow night."
I'll bring my axe and
We shall be free in the morning
We shall be free and the preacher
We shall be free and the rooster
The Good Lord will set you free
You might also likeI was down in the henhouse on my knees
Thought I heard a chicken sneeze
Only a rooster saying his prayers
Thanking his God for the hens upstairs
He's praying
We shall be free take a collection
We shall be free all day
You know the Good Lord will set you free
You know some folks say
The preacher done steal
I caught two in my cornfield
One had a bushel, other had a peck
One had a rope down near his neck
Eating my dry corn
We shall be free and roasting it
We shall be free of the preacher
You know the Good Lord will set you free
You know some folks say
When times get hard
You oughtta put your trust in God
It makes no difference don't you see
Ain't a hog that can outrun me
That hammock we shall be free
Them hog eyes we shall be free
Them chitlins we shall be free
You know the Good Lord will set you free
We shall be free
We shall be free
We shall be free
We shall be free
We shall be free in the morning
We shall be free in the evening
We shall be free all day
Yeah the Good Lord will set you free
Yeah the Good Lord will set you free
Yeah the Good Lord will set you freeEmbed
