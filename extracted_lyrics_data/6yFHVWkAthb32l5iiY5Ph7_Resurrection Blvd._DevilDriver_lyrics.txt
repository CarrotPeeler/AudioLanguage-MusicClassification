4 ContributorsResurrection Blvd. Lyrics
She brings me nails and turpentine
All of this time, the girl was mine
I am in love like a rusted dog
All of the time, my head in the fog

Cats in the corner, dogs on the floor
Phone keeps ringing; she's asking for more
The spaces between places
I'm not worthy
Leave me alone
You should have never left me alive
You should have sat and watched me die

Isn't it hard
Living on Resurrection Boulevard?
Isn't it hard?
Isn't it hard?
Isn't it hard
Living on Resurrection Boulevard?
Isn't it hard?
Isn't it hard?
You might also like
He brings me life so full of smiles
All of this time, been friends for miles
Logging hours, laughing for days
Talking shit on others' ways

Cats in the corner, dogs on the floor
Phone keeps ringing; she's asking for more
The spaces between places
I'm not worthy
Leave me alone
You should have never left me alive
You should have sat and watched me die

Isn't it hard
Living on Resurrection Boulevard?
Isn't it hard?
Isn't it hard?
Isn't it hard
Living on Resurrection Boulevard?
Isn't it hard?
Isn't it hard?
Isn't it?
You, you should have sat and watched me die
On Resurrection Boulevard
You, you should have never left me alive

Isn't it hard?
Isn't it hard
On Resurrection Boulevard?
Isn't it hard
On Resurrection Boulevard?
Isn't it hard?
Isn't it?Embed
