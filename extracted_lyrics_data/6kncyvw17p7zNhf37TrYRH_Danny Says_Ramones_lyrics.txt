12 ContributorsDanny Says Lyrics
Danny says we gotta go
Gotta go to Idaho
But we can't go surfing 'cause it's twenty below

Soundcheck's at 5:02
Record stores and interviews
Oh, but I can't wait to be with you tomorrow

Baby, oh
We got nowhere to go
And it may sound funny, but it's true, ooh

Hangin' out in 100 B
Watching Get Smart on TV
Thinking about you and me and you and me

Hanging out in L.A and there's nowhere to go
It ain't Christmas if there ain't no snow
Listening to Sheena on the radio

Soundcheck's at 5:02
Record stores and interviews
Oh, but I can't wait to be with you tomorrow
You might also like
Baby, oh
We got nowhere to go
And it may sound funny, but it's true, ooh

Hangin' out in 100 B
Watching Get Smart on TV
Thinking about you and me and you and meEmbed
