1 ContributorShip of Fools LyricsA land of fear and dirty tricks
Will take much more than words to fix
Those monkeys walked away Scot free
Never made much sense to me
One paints pictures on his ranch
The other makes money given half a chance
It's a one way ticket a one way track
Can’t shift the monkey on your back
Ship of fools goes round again
Ship of fools without a plan
All are lost, they're all at sea
No place to hide no sanctuary
Invite them in for a cosy chat
Stop hiding behind some legal crap
Now millions walk for an eternity
To find a safer place to be
Ship of fools goes round again
Ship of fools without a plan
All are lost, They're all at sea
No place to hide, no sanctuary
Risks you took were far too grand
Under crescent moon and barren land
Security as what you sought
Now your energies have come to nought
You might also likePrice we paid was much too high
’Cause one day those oil wells will dry
Ignore the paths of history
Never made much sense to me
Skip of fools goes round again
Ship of fools without a plan
All are lost, they're all at sea
No place to hide, no sanctuaryEmbed
