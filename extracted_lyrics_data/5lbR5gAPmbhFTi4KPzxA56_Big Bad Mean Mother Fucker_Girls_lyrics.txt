6 ContributorsBig Bad Mean Motherfucker Lyrics
I've got a high school crush on a California girl, oh yeah
I've got a cool guitar and a bag of marijuana, man, uh-huh
I'm gonna rock like no one ever told me to stop
Make you a believer, I'm a big bad mean motherfucker

I've got an ice cream cone and I'm feeling fine tonight
And when I get you back home, oh, you know I'm gonna do you right, oh yeah
I'm gonna rock like no one ever told me to stop
Make you a believer, I'm a big bad mean motherfucker

I wear my short jean shorts on a sunny San Francisco day
I like to heal by the water in the sunny San Francisco Bay, oh yeah
I'm gonna rock like no one ever told me to stop
Make you a believer, I'm a big bad mean motherfuckerYou might also likeEmbed
