1 ContributorFade Into You LyricsIf you were the ocean and I was the sun
The day made me heavy and gravity won
I was the red and you were the blue
I could just fade into you
If you were a window and I was the rain
I'd pour myself out and wash off the pain
I'd fall like a tear so your light could shine through
Then I'd just fade into you
In your heart, in your head, in your arms, in your bed
Til there's no way to know where you end
And where I begin
In your heart, in your head, in your arms, in your bed
If I was a shadow and you were a street
The cobblestone midnight is where we first meet
Til the lights flickered out, we dance with the moon
Then I'd just fade into you
If I was just ashes and you were the ground
And under your willow they laid me down
There'll be no trace that one was once two
After I fade into you
In your heart, in your head, in your arms, in your bed
Til there's no way to know where you end
And where I begin
In your heart, in your head, in your arms, in your bedYou might also likeEmbed
