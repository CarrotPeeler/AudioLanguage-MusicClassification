1 ContributorEducated Guess LyricsLooks like my crazy family
Is down one crazy daughter cuz
I'm shipwrecked on a desert that
Once was underwater just
Looking for a swift turnof phrase
Some colors to fly
As I float by
In the parade
Plus I dream in skin scented sentances
Of a stronger faster fiercer you
And to each noun, verb and predicate
I dedicate a vivid hue
But you ain't done too well
Getting past your permenant pastel
Have you now?
Yes the desert seemed so promising
But then it paled somehow
So school is in session
Get your chin off your desk
Now pick up your pencil
And turn over your test
Use your education
And take an educated guess
About me
See Ani DiFranco LiveGet tickets as low as $57You might also likeI've got a slot at eye level like
A speakeasy door
And i know you know the password
Cuz i've seen you here before
And i've got something sweet for you
And i don't care if it is more than you deserve
I've got a lot of love and a lot of nerve
So watch me while i take this curve
Yes school is in session
Get your chin off your desk
Now pick up your pencil
And turn over your test
Use your education
And take an educated guess
About me
Plus i have this whole new family
And i'm in love with each of them
And i'm on this list called lucky
Whenever i'm in reach of them
And i'm learning how to say
That i'd be happy either way
With your love
I'm calling on the stars above
School is in session
Get your chin off your desk
Now pick up your pencil
Turn over your test
Use your education
And take an educated guess
