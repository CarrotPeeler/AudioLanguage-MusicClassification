1 ContributorTalk To Me LyricsTalk to me, talk to me
Keep my mind from wandering
Fears alive the air is dead, keep me from the silence
No defence against the ghost
At the end I need you most
Talk to me, talk to me
When the morning breaks
When the morning breaks
Come to me, come to me
Sweep away the last remains
Highs are gone, only one way left to go
My defence against the ghost
At the end I need you most
Come to me, come to me
When the morning breaks
When the morning breaks
When the morning breaks
When the morning breaks
(Such a cold, cold light)
3 thousand miles away
Is this a trap I'm in, it used to be escape
Are you my friend or my worst enemy, talk to me keep my mind from wandering
Talk to me, talk to me

When the morning breaks
When the morning breaks
It's such a cold, cold light
Cold as the comfort
When the morning breaks
When the morning breaks
When the morning breaks
It's such a cold, cold light
When the morning breaks
It's such a cold, cold light
When the morning breaks
It's such a cold, cold reminderEmbed
