1 ContributorOther Side of Love LyricsThought of you today
I saw your face, in a picture
Are these the better days
Since youve been gone away?
Since youve been gone away
And ive been on my own
But only when i want
Do you wake up alone?
I bet you dont
(Chorus)
And even if we want to
We can't blur those lies
Atleast we know we were high
But we came down
We were high
Now we're under ground
But did we waste our time
Or did the time waste us?
Is different on this side
The other side of love
The otherside of love
(Chorus)
And even if we want to
We can't blur those lies
Atleast we know we were high
But we came down
We were high
Now we're under ground
You know were better
You know were better
For something else
I've gotta let you go
Gotta let you
Ive gotta let you go
Gotta let you
I've gotta let you go
Gotta let you go
We were high
But we came down
We were high
Now we're under ground
We were high
But we came down
We were high
But we came down
We came down
We came down
We came down
We came down
We came downYou might also likeEmbed
