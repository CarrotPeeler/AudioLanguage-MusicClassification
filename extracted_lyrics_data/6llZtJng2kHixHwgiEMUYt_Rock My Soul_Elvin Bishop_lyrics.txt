Turn the music on
And let it soothe you
When you're feeling good
Turn the music up
And let it move you
Make you wanna shout
Make you wanna holler "Hallelujah"
(Hallelujah)
Doesn't make her shout
(Rock my soul)
Hey, come on, rock my soul
(Rock my soul)
When you listen to the music
Let it sink in to you
You'll be surprised to find out
How much good a little bit can do you
Make it tremble
Make cold chills run all through you
Make you wanna shout
Make you wanna holler "Hallelujah"
(Hallelujah)
I love to feel the music just
(Rock my soul)
Ah, that's what I'm talkin' about
(Rock my soul)
I wish I had somebody to help me shout
(Rock my soul, yeah yeah)
(Hallelujah)
