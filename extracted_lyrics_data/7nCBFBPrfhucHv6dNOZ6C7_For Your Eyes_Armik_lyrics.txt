2 ContributorsIncendiary LyricsYour time will come
Your doom is pending
For no one can remain untouchable
And there is no one to depend
No one to pretend for
Your eyes are set on your dominion
That falsely you are claiming to deserve
And there is nowhere to escape
No way to evade a war
We remember when the sun shone bright
Then your presence brought a pеrmanent shadow
'Cause the light of truth was covеred up
By a layer of deceit
The tyrant stares defiant at his feeble prey
But when the masses unite their strength
Revenge will lit the fire
Burning our past away
'Cause decency does matter more than wealth and fame
Arming the humble with spiteful rage
Enough to shield the venom
From a thousand vicious snakes
The screams are loud
The bombs are louder
But will can turn around the impossible
And it is too late to repent
Too late to save your soul

The scale is rigged to benefit the wolves
And nothing satisfies their greed
They just keep taking more
"For we were born here to bleed and with our bloody hands we'll plant the seeds of what's to come, we'll reach the peace we need to live in harmony among ourselves, no matter the cost, no matter the loss"
We remember when the sun shone bright
Then your presence brought a permanent shadow
'Cause the light of truth was covered up
By a layer of deceit
The tyrant stares defiant at his feeble prey
But when the weakened unite their strength
Revenge will lit the fire
Burning all our past away
The tyrant stares defiant at his feeble prey
But when the masses unite their strength
Revenge will lit the fire
Burning our past away
'Cause decency does matter more than wealth and fame
Arming the humble with spiteful rage
Enough to shield the venom
From a thousand vicious snakesEmbed
