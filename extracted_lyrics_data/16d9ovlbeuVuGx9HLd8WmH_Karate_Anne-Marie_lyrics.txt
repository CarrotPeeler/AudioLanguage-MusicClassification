10 ContributorsKarate Lyrics
You found me when I was young
Thought I'd be weak, but I was wrong
So unique, you made me strong
The fight inside me is what kept me going on

I don't know if you want to be the one
Ichi, ni, san, shi
I don't know if you want to be the one
Ichi, ni, san, shi

Work hard on me like karate
Cause your body is what I need
So work with me, be a part of me
Like I want you to be
Like karate, like karate, like karate

Mouth open, open wide
This technique keeps me in line
I want you to walk this side
Patterns and rhythm and our hearts in time

I don't know if you want to be the one
Ichi, ni, san, shi
I don't know if you want to be the one
Ichi, ni, san, shi
You might also like
Work hard on me like karate
Cause your body is what I need
So work with me, be a part of me
Like I want you to be
Like karate, like karate, like karate

I can let go if you watch me
And I know that I want to
I can promise that I will take
And I'll protect you
Can't remember where it started
But I know where it will go
You can go where I go
If you follow, follow

Work hard on me like karate
Cause your body is what I need
So work with me, be a part of me
Like I want you to be
Like karate
Work hard on me like karate
Cause your body is what I need
So work with me, be a part of me
Like I want you to be
Like karate, like karate, like karate
Da, da, da, da
Da, da, da, da
Da, da, da, da
Na, na, na, oh
Da, da, da, da
