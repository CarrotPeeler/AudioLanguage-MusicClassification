1 ContributorYour Place Lyrics
Baby, I know it's been hard for you in this business
But you can't give up
You got a lot of people waitin' on you
Do your mamma a favor
Give them some of that Chicago style R&B that I brought you up on
Ooh, yeah, uh
Uh, uh, uh
Y'all ready?
R'n'B ain't been the same since I left it
'Bout to bring it back, okay, I'm gonna get it
Yo, this your boy, Donell Jones
Let's get it

I was at the bar
Shorty was starin' at me lookin' hot
She had on red lipstick
Stilettos to match it and a body that won't quit
I looked under her table, to see he got a bill
Attached to shoelace, I had to catch myself
I'm like, damn, isn't she sophisticated?
Smokin' on a Cuban and no other woman is takin'
And it looked like it barf up a bowl tonight
Send the bartender over, see what she like
'Cause that body look way too soft
If she leave it up, the dam gon' set it off
And that's when I stepped to her
Pimpin' my way over, noticed I wanna do her
And then I whispered in her ear
Tellin' her stuff that she wanna hear
You might also like
It only take a second to think about it
I need to know if you're goin' or not
Come on, come on, let me know
'Cause I really need to know
It only take a second to think about it
Girl, you know that I want your body
Come on, come on, just let me know
'Cause I really need to know

Can we do it in your place, baby
Or take it to my place, baby?
Can we do it in your place, baby
Or take it to my place, baby?
Can we do it in your place, baby
Or take it to my place, baby?
Can we do it in your place, baby
Or take it to my place, baby?

I didn't have to play my cards
'Cause she was infatuated from the start
And with a girl in front, she want it like I want it
Plus the both of us are adults
And then we hit the dance floor and do some steppin'
It's an opportunity to start caressin'
As that 34-24-36
And I can picture gettin' into it
Ooh, girl, I feel like I'm 'bout to pop off the night
Another round of some shots couldn't make it right
But that body feel way too soft
If she leave it up, the dam gon' set it off
Baby, we can make love music
Let's blow this box so we can get right to it
I know my voice is tickling your ear
Make this decision, girl, let's get about it, yeah
It only take a second to think about it
Let me know if you're goin' or not
Come on, come on and let me know
'Cause I really need to know
It only take a second to think about it
Girl, you know that I want your body
Come on, come on, just let me know
'Cause I really need to know

Can we do it in your place, baby
Or take it to my place, baby?
Can we do it in your place, baby
Or take it to my place, baby?
Can we do it in your place, baby
Or take it to my place, baby?
Can we do it in your place, baby
Or take it to my place, baby?
Can we do it in your place, baby
Or take it to my place, baby?
Can we do it in your place, baby
Or take it to my place, baby?
Can we do it in your place, baby
Or take it to my place, baby?
Can we do it in your place, baby
Or take it to my place, baby?Embed
