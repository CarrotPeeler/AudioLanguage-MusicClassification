11 ContributorsWait for You Lyrics
If I asked to kiss ya
Would you say yes or turn and walk away? Oh, baby
See I must admit, girl
'Cause all the crazy things that go through my head
Woah, oh-oh, nah

It seemed just like the perfect move at the time
For me to make you mine
Girl, you sexy from head to toe
You said you think we should wait a while
And it might be hard, but

But I won't complain
You could've been anywhere else but you're here with me, oh, yeah
We can travel to space
And as long as I got you right here next to me, I'm straight
No-o-o-o-o
Girl, I'll wait fo-or, for you, yes, I will
You kno-o-o-ow I said I'll wait for you

I just wanna love ya
Lord knows that I can't wait for the day (Oh-oh)
I said I must admit, girl (Girl)
Baby, I swear I'll do whatever it takes (To keep you here with me)

It's been a while and we both know that I've been patient, girl
