Hopefully return in April
I've heard the winds speak of a fight
And it hit my heart like a thorn
Whispering voices appear
I can't escape what I feel
All I can see, all I believe in
Is connected to our kindred souls
I feel the thorn (I feel the thorn) in my flesh
The pounding of blood in my head
I cry aloud (you cry aloud)
I cry of anger
My enemy (your enemy) will never forget me
I heard you calling my name
I saw your colourless face
Fire in your eyes
Where do you go to?
I dreamt of an enemy threatening you
I feel the thorn (I feel the thorn) in my flesh
The pounding of blood in my head
I cry aloud (you cry aloud)
I cry of anger
My enemy (your enemy) will never forget me
You might also likeI feel the thorn (I feel the thorn) in you flesh
The pounding of blood in your head
You cry aloud (I cry)
You cry of anger
You enemy (my enemy) will never forget you
Hold me
Breathe with me
Until the end of time
I feel the thorn (I feel the thorn) in my flesh
The pounding of blood in my head
I cry aloud (you cry aloud)
I cry of anger
My enemy (your enemy) will never forget me
I feel the thorn (I feel the thorn) in you flesh
The pounding of blood in your head
You cry aloud (I cry)
You cry of anger
You enemy (my enemy) will never forget youEmbed
