1 ContributorJumper On The Line Lyrics
See my jumper, Lord, hangin' out on the line
See my jumper, Lord, hangin' out on the line
Know by that, something on my mind

Would not have been, Lord, if it hadn't been for you
Would not have baby, Lord, if it hadn't been for you
Way down here, what you wanna do

Bring my supper, baby Lord, let me go to bed
Bring my supper, baby Lord, let me go to bed
This white lightning done gone to my head

See my jumper, oh  hangin' on the line
See my jumper, oh hangin' on the line
Know by that, something on my mind

Would not, oh baby how, baby if it hadn't been for you
Would not, oh baby how, baby if it hadn't been for you
Got me way down here, way you wanna do

Fix my supper, baby let me go to bed
Fix my supper, oh baby let me go to bed
This white lightning done gone to my head
This white lightning done gone to my head
This white lightning done gone to my head
To my head
To my head
To my head
To my head

See my jumper, hangin' out on the line
See my jumper, hangin' out on the line
Yeah know by that, Lord something on my mind
Yeah know by that, Lord something on my mind

Would not been here, baby, if it hadn't been for you
Would not been here, baby, yeah honey if it hadn't been for you
Yeah you got me down here baby, treat me like you wanna do
You got me down here baby, treat me like you wanna do

Fix my supper baby, honey let me go to bed
Fix my supper baby, oh honey let me go to bed
That moonshine whiskey done gone to my head
That moonshine whiskey done gone to my headEmbed
