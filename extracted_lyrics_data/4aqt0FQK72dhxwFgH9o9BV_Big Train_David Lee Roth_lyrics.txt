Comin' down from Brownsville, Baltimore
El Paso fly, better step aside babe, oh
Talkin' 'bout Miami to the top handle of New York
1, 2, 3, 4
My train, your station
Full steam across the nation
You'll be brownin' your Bermudas
When I blow this tomb with a view, yeah all right
Third rail, can't stand it
Santa Fe to the mid-Atlantic
Got a steel-wheeled radial prophylactic for you, yeah
Ain't afraid to use it now
It takes up all your time
Being leader of the pack
Just when you get that rat race licked
Well, here come faster rats
(Big train) Are you an engineer?
(Big train) Or a passenger?
(Big train) Whatever gets you to the top of the hill
You're on a (big train) strapped to the front of a
(Big train) Double stack thunder
And (Big train)
And you're runnin' just in front of the wheels, oh
You might also likeI've known fast livin'
And I know wine, women and song
Become a long locomotive for me, babe
Oh yeah
That train be rollin'
Not me, I'm gone before wine and women
Turn into beer, the old lady and TV
All you ever wanted
Was to tap dance, run away
Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose
Sometimes it rains right on your
(Big train) Time gets movin'
(Big train) When ya' don't know what you're doin'
(Big train) And you're wonderin' if you ever will
(Big train) Oh, honey are with me?
(Big train) Or is the train doin' sixty?
(Big train) Or maybe you're standing still, look out
(Big train) Gets movin'
(Big train) Don't know what you're doin'
(Big train) And you're wonderin' if you ever will, woah
(Big train) Honey, are ya with me?
(Big train) Or is the train doin' sixty, baby
Or maybe you're standing still
Oh yeah
Always 'nother train pulling into that station
And I'll be smilin' again
Can't help it
That's the kind of guy I am
Awe reap!Embed
