11 ContributorsSing for Me Lyrics
Sometimes when I'm sitting on my bed
Feeling so, so lonely
Wishing "someone hold me"
All I have is three little notes playing in my head
Outside I can cover all the scars
Inside lie the words just pleading to be heard
'Cause all I have is three million melodies to kill the hurt

And now I'm ready
Now I'm gonna sing 'em all out
Sing them out just for myself
I don't even care what the world thinks 'bout how I sound

'Cause when I open my mouth
My whole heart comes out
Every tear I wanna cry is satisfied
I'm singing 'til I'm winning
I'ma sing all night
'Cause when I open my mouth
There's no place to hide
Everything that I've been feeling runs wild and free
I'm singing 'cause I'm winning
I'ma sing for me

I stand in believing who I am
Take shots at my heart
But who am I to give up?
Everybody needs a melody to set their souls free
My stage is the greatest in the world
Give back to the ones who struggled with me, stayed true
Reminding me to see my only chosen destiny

And now I'm ready
Now I'm gonna sing it all out
Sing it out just for myself
And I don't even care what the world thinks 'bout how I sound

'Cause when I open my mouth
My whole heart comes out
Every tear I wanna cry is satisfied
I'm singing 'til I'm winning
I'ma sing all night
'Cause when I open my mouth
There's no place to hide (Hey)
Everything that I've been feeling runs wild and free
I'm singing 'cause I'm winning
I'ma sing for me
Sing for me (Sing for me, oh)
Sing for myself, sing what I believe (Oh)
Let my heart, heart come out
Right here, right now, let the rain come down (Yeah)
Sing for me (Sing for me)
Oh, sing for myself, sing what I believe
Let my heart, heart come out
Right here, right now, make my own, my very own sound

'Cause when I open my mouth
My whole heart comes out
Every tear I wanna cry is satisfied
I'm singing 'til I'm winning (Oh)
I'ma sing all night
'Cause when I open my mouth
There's no place to hide (Hey)
Everything that I've been feeling runs wild and free
I'm singing 'cause I'm winning
I'ma sing for me, yeah

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, hey, yeah
Oh yeah, oh-oh yeah
Hey
Oh-oh-oh1Embed
