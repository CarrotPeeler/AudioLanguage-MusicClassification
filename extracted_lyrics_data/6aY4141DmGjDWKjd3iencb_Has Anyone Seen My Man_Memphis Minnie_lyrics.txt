Come to see me at night
And don't leave until three
So, has anyone here
Seen my man today?
He left me this morning, ooh ooh
Lord I think he's gone astray
I used to fix his breakfast
Carry it to the bed
He's gone and left me
I soon to be dead
So, has anyone here
Seen my man today?
He left me this morning, ooh ooh
Lord I think he's gone astray
Well, the one I got
Is so hard to get along with
Everything he do
He try to keep it his
So, has any one here
Seen my man today?
He left me this morning, ooh ooh
Lord I think he's gone astray
Oh, take it away now

I don't know where's he's at
Who's love-a got me really tied like that
So, has any one here
Seen my man today?
He left me this morning, ooh ooh
Lord I think he's gone astray
I been looking for him all day
Looking for him all night
Crazy 'bout my love
And don't want it out of my sight
So, has any one here
Seen my man today?
He left me this morning, ooh ooh
Lord I think he's gone astrayEmbed
