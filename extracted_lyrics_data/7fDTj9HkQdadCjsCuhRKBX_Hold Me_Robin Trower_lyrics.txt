1 ContributorHold Me LyricsI'm down on my love
I'm depending on you
I'm counting on your love
To help me see it through
Why don't you hold me
Honey won't you hold me
I've tried other loves
But they never seemed enough
Why don't you come on over mama
And do your stuff
Hold me
Honey won't you hold me
Some get smooth and some get rough
Some get it all and it still ain't enough
Some gotta rise and some gotta fall
But baby, baby, don't you know that ain't all
I'd give you the world
And you know I'd give the moon
If you give me what's mine
And you better make it soon
Come on and hold me
Honey won't you hold me

And you'll never have to cry
And I won't have to feed you
With the same old cheating lies
Hold me
Honey won't you hold me
Some get low and some get high
Some gotta walk and some get to fly
The old get old and lose desire
Baby, baby don't you know that ain't all
Some get smooth and some get rough
Some get it all and it still ain't enough
Some gotta rise and some gotta fall
But baby, baby, don't you know that ain't all
That ain't all, baby, that ain't allEmbed
