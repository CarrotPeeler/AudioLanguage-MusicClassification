Lower lifeboats as you sail through murky water
Wear your blindfold, ball and chain August daughter
Muzzle your mouth, dose you up
Lay on the ground, celebrate new blood
No sugarcoat, stitch you up
Head in a cone, where's the commission?

Fear the cold exteriors
Tall shadows, Surveillance
Fear the scent, the lukewarm breath
Clench your toes and bite your tongue

Aching, you beg on your knees, loosening collar
Shake that old pinball machine for stiff dollars
Refuse demands throwing fists
Head in the sand where you don't exist
Freed like a discarded fish
Unprofitable, too old to learn new tricks

Fear the cold exteriors
Tall shadows, Surveillance
Fear the scent, the lukewarm breath
Clench your toes and bite your tongue
You might also like
Fear the cold exteriors
Tall shadows, Surveillance
Fear the scent, the lukewarm breath
Clench your toes and bite your tongue
