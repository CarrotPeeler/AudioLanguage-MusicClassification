2 ContributorsI Put a Spell on You Lyrics( Screamin' Jay Hawkins Cover / Live )
I put a spell on you
Beause you're mine
You better stop the things you do
I ain't lyin'
No i ain't lyin'
You know i can't stand it
You're fooling around
I can't stand it
You are breaking me down
I put a spell on you
Because you're mine
You're mine
You know i can't standing it
You're fooling around
I can't standing it
You are breaking me down (down down)
I put a spell on you
Because you're mine
You hear me
I put a spell on you
Because you're mine
You better stop the things you do
I am not lying... No, i am not lyingSee Katie Melua LiveGet tickets as low as $147You might also likeEmbed
