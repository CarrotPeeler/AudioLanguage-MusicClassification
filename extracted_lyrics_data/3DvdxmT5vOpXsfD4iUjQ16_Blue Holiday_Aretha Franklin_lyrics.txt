It's been a blue holiday since you've been gone
Oh darling, won't you hurry, hurry home
It's been a blue, a blue holiday, and I'm all alone
My dear, I need your love to keep, to keep me warm

I cry when I hear the chapel bells ring
And sometimes I cry all through the night
Won't you please come home
And make my, make my holiday right

It's been a blue, oh, yes it has, it's been a blue holiday
And I'm all alone
My dear, I need your love, your love to keep me, keep me warm
It's been a blue, yeah
Oh, been blue since you, since you've been gone, yeah, yeahYou might also likeEmbed
