1 ContributorMAVERICK LyricsThese days ain't gon play ain't gon play
If you take my time then you gon have to pay you gon pay
Talk that goof get juiced like lemonade off that
Goop you the fruit loop leader of that goof troop
Deuce deuce all up in my cup then I snooze snooze
Lose cool taking too much psyches going coo coo
New school rockin green stripes going blues clues
Who knew kid just got a stack and it's too blue
Chill in my room it is my tomb lie in my bed til about noon
Getting so high I don't know why
Write til I die might touch the sky
Ain't got no clue I am that dude
Ain't gotta prove nothing to you
Suicide on my mind do do do do
What purpose is mine do do
These days feeling so lame I'm insane
Pacing back and forth up in my cave
Rolling tray licking down fat L of that AK
It's that gas I was sad and shit but then I got that pay
Got that bag you a drag bitch
Rock like Lenny Kravitz
Magic puff until I'm static
Wreaking causing havoc
Ripple turned wave call me maveric
Lavish eat up on some green like its cabbage
Mastiff what my girl call me when she catch dick
Fat lip don't wanna waste my time on some fuck shit
I just wanna get turnt up at the function
Get up out my face I just wanna eat my dumplings
These days ain't gon play ain't gon play
If you take my time then you gon have to pay you gon pay
Talk that goof get juiced like lemonade off that
Goop you the fruit loop leader of that goof troop
Deuce deuce all up in my cup then I snooze snooze
Lose cool taking too much psyches going coo coo
New school rockin green stripes going blues clues
Who knew kid just got a stack and it's too blueYou might also likeEmbed
