I've got the Bomb
I've got the Bomb
I've got the Bomb
(You've gotta, you've got)
I've got the Bomb
I've got the Bomb
I've got the Bomb
She's got the thang
That Boomerang
Sing that song I sang
Just a fine thang
She's got that bite
From left to right
Hit me once or twice
Signifyin' slice
I've got the Bomb
You've got that bliss
Bliss like this
Bomb when you kiss
B-B-B-B-B-Bliss

You've got the shake
Earthquake break
My belly ache
You do me for a take
I've got the Bomb
You got the power
Cat's meow
Sweat from the brow
You got me on the prowl
You got that heat
Make me freak
Make a brother weak
Blow me off my feet
I've got the Bomb
You got the click
Meatball thick
Slip-a-chick-a-licka
Signifyin' stick-a
You got the click
Meatball thick
Slip-a-chick-a-licka
Signifyin' stick-a
I've got the Bomb
I've got the Bomb
I've got the Bomb

Yeah, she got that pill
Feel so ill
Thrill on the hill
Sweet Whippourwill
She's got that bite
From left to right
Hit me once or twice
