2 ContributorsFar From the Dark LyricsTell me everything I need to know
Before I face the oceans and I'll face the storm
Give me everything that I need to have
Tell me the reason
Be my shelter when the rain is to fall
Save me from the thunder, from my endless despair
Bleeding through my sacrifice to be strong
Tell me the reason
Take me away
Far from the dark
Lead me when I am lost
Take me away
'Cause a part of me died
As long as I'm still
I'm still alive
Tell me every lie that I'll never know
Let me see another scar that my life didn't show
Craving for a place where I can belong
Tell me the reason
Give me a reason
Take me away
Far from the dark
Lead me when I am lost
Take me away
'Cause a part of me died
But I'm still alive
You might also likeI'm still alive
I'm still alive
I'm still alive
I'm still alive
Take me away
Far from the dark
Lead me when I am lost
Take me away
'Cause a part of me died
A part of me died
But I'm still aliveEmbed
