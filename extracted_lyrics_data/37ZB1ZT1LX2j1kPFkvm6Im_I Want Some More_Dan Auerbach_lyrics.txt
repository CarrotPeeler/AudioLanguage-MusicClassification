7 ContributorsI Want Some More Lyrics
You got the tenderness that I've been searching for
Oh, oh, oh I want some more
You got sweet lips like I did never taste before
Oh, oh, oh I want some more

Everything you got
Just what I've always wanted
Right down to a T
Nothin' about you that don't please me

I'm just a kid and you're a walking candy store
Oh, oh, oh I want some more


You got the tenderness that I've been searching for
Oh, oh, oh I want some more, yeah
You got sweet lips like I did never taste before
Oh, oh, oh I want some more

Everything you got
Just what I've always wanted
Right down to a T
Nothin' about you that don't please me
You might also like
I'm just a kid and you're a walking candy store
Oh, oh, oh I want some more
Yeah, yeahEmbed
