3 ContributorsX2Y Lyrics
 say fuck
Can you hear me now?!
I'm the next step of your evolution
The most absurd and selfish shit
Our senseless world puked
Unable to socialize with you pigs
Look at you dancing
At the surface of your own lives
Without the conscience
You will be ashes before the sunset

You are insanity, not me
You are insanity, not me
You are insanity
Your truth is mine
Your truth is mine
Your truth is mine, I shall be X 2 Y
Your truth is mine
Your truth is mine
Your truth is mine, I shall be X 2 Y
You might also likeYour truth is mine
Your truth is mine
Your truth is mine, I shall be X 2 Y
Your truth is mine
Your truth is mine
Your truth is mine, X 2 YEmbed
