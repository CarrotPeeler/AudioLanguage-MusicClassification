4 ContributorsI Swear Lyrics
I have never seen an angel standing oh so close to me
I have never touched someone and felt so electricity
I am taken over by the endless possibilities
And I'm waiting for the day you say that you belong to me
I swear
No one will ever love you better
I swear
We could be so good together

I never wanted anyone the way I want you (baby)
I never met someone who gives me everything you do
I swear
If I'm with you there's no other
I swear
There will never be another

Because of you there are more reasoned to be thankful everyday
Because of you I'm reminded of the chances I should take
It't the comfort of your warm embrace that shelters all the rain
And there's nothing I wouldn't give for you to feel the same
I swear
No one will ever love you better
I swear
We could be so good together

Somewhere, Somehow you appeared
And everything's so different now
When your around
The promise of all we could be
Is what keeps me going now
I'm never down
