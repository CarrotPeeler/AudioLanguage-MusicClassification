2 ContributorsLove Donâ€™t Love Nobody Lyrics
Well, talk about love, it's a doggone shame
Talk about love I hate that name
Love don't love poor me at all
Love is the cause of my downfall

Love don't love nobody
Love don't love nobody
Love don't love nobody
Love is the devil but it won't get me

Love is fine if it's on your side
Love did me wrong and how I cried
Love made baby put me down
And now the news is all over town

Love don't love nobody
Love don't love nobody
Love don't love nobody
Doggone you love, I'm through with you, hey

Well I had a lot of money, living like a king
Never had to worry about a doggone thing
Love came along, ain't got a dime
My baby left me standing in the back door crying
You might also like
Love don't love nobody
Love don't love nobody
Love don't love nobody
Love is the devil but it won't get me

Well I'm gonna find me a woman uglier than me
She can be old or fat, maybe
All I wanna do is rock at home
Love's the proposition from now on

Love don't love nobody
Love don't love nobody
Love don't love nobody
Doggone you love, I'm through with you, now

Love don't love nobody
Love don't love nobody
Love don't love nobody
Doggone you love, I'm through with youEmbed
