10 ContributorsQP vs. QP Lyrics
I'm glad you don't got no cap on
You can give us all that Rogaine picture
You got me feelin' like your father, so I won't play wit' ya'
This for the QP, that's the camera man, no way mister
That mean John Doe shootin' a body, of a no-name nigga
And you ain't takin' my name, nigga, QP you wouldn't dare
Shoulda known I'm a trained lumberjack
I ain't cuttin' back and that I, would prepare
But if Superman out here movin' faster than a speeding bullet, swear
I guess the only way to slow you down from that tempo's to put a, bullet there
You know what I don't like about you, Qleen Paper?
You spell, like a teenager
Using my name for free, illiterate fuck, couldn't even have you sign a, fee waiver
You don't have to be a spelling bee major or the alphabet's creator
To see that the C in 'clean' can't be Q, I'll say it again, I know it's clean Paper
I say who you seein', Qleen? Can't be Q, 'cause sir up and met a son that could lean Paper
See I tried to be meek, it's a nightmare, I'm the dream chaser
Created Innuendo to watch the flow I crafted, as a team player
You need Miles, right? Clickin', deletin', wipin' ya' slate clean Paper
You get paid to crack heads? No crackhead, you a freebaser
You wanna blow? Fine, off dope lines, since we, both are coke sniffers
Just know, that'll help you overdose quicker
Based on our threads they say we better than them so-and-so niggas
But we ain't cut from the same fabric 'cause we ain't nowhere close, nigga
How should I expose niggas? Chilla Jones, for real a clone
Y'all think y'all seen schemin'?
See I do this all year, for me it's always scheme season
Is it winter, no, it's autumn fall, that mean, everything leavin'
Street sweeper the whole house, some'll call it spring cleanin'
You squeamish, fool with the world, let it digest you and spit you out
See that's what it does with you outcasts, as a rebel it sticks you out
Like retired umpires, you at home, unsettled you missin' out
But today Qleen's exorcism 'cause it's hard as a devil to get you out
Now there's levels of spittin' writtens out
But that shit you did in the D, I wanna start off, you wrong
Why sell yourself short, that'll get you marked out alone
Now I knew you were roamin', though it wasn't too smart, I condone
I know why you thought you'd get good  reception
'Cause you read four bars off your phone
Now will he start off a clone and choke again? Do you look to, crowd for the beef?
When this gangster cripples himself, then the crowd's gonna see
Now out-of-town fans look, like you brother, even when you miles from the D
But then you choke out of town and look like your brother, Miles from the D
He's probably now gonna cease, choke up in 60 seconds, that's a minute's time
You can't work at the shoe store, with that performance, you can't, finish lines
That's why each step gets blown out of proportion when it slips his mind
But I can say you're not a real cokehead, you know us cokeheads, we don't forget the lines
Now you did switch your grind, with the QP shit, but why'd you have to go and take the greatest?
And make yourself public enemy number one, you wouldn't Flavor Flav it
You, Bishop? Pfft, I never heard a faker statement
That's someone flimsy dishin' it out if you sayin' that Paper played it
You made it on a whole 'nother scale, I made way for you
The combination of the letters QP I made, safe for you
, things I couldn't wait to do
No matter how you spell 'clean' Q, I could still see, the fake in you
Your mom looks like a dried-up grape, yep, the bitch raising you
The same old bitch that told you good things, came in two
I'm not feelin' it, ay oh well, let me explain my aim to you
Even when you freestyle I should still get paid for Paper views
Even when you choke and freeze, I'll still get paid for Paper views
You spelled it Q-U-E-P, didn't get great reviews
Then you changed it to QP, we started beefin' over mistaken views
My buzz big as a living room at the time, U-Haul, I was makin' moves
I'm Don King promotin' you, I should get paid for pay-per-view
I called Surf like "Yo Surf, Surf, Surf, Surf, you think it's okay to sue?
Should I kidnap his bitch and kid since this is what it's been taken to?"
That's like takin' my baby, my hard work and my labor too
Ain't this a mother, 'cause after all my pushin', this pussy breakin' through
Flow nastier than hospital patient flu
You'll get hospitalized and the nurse'll bring you hospital patient food
I see you not makin' it, that's hospital patient food
With Kevorkian, it's unfortunate you see, that's a doctor that breaks the rules

Niggas in the streets asked why I don't take SMACK serious
I told 'em it ain't that dawg, it's just that when you in the streets, fuckin' with that smack,  it's hard to take SMACK serious
That shit had me on some, 'I got 50 here, 20 over here, I got 80 over here'
Nigga I got so confused with that math I wanted to smack Serius
Now let's stop with the games
'Cause it's been a while since I hopped in this thang
And I'd be a lie if I say the block ain't to blame
But I told myself, the day I hop in the box with this lame
I might have to box with this lame
Now even though I fuckin' hate you, I must thank you
'Cause only reason I hopped in the game was 'cause I seent this twot with the name
Now puttin' this fake-ass QPeezy to rest
Might be one of the easiest debts
He ain't gon' do shit but try to scheme me to death
So this a plot for the brain, I, hop in the Range
Bangin' Pac, before I hit his block, I was cockin' the thang
Caught him walkin' somewhere around Stock with his dame
I hopped out, cocked, put the chop to her frame
Broke her off, he got the K with the stock in exchange
You know what I don't like about your soft ass, dog?
How the fuck this nigga go from S.O.N.S. to Innuendo
Then he always do that bullshit ass intro, involving Innuendo
This nigga be on some "how you gon' beat me if it ain't in you to win do'
No I said I'm gonna end you to win dough, no it ain't in you—"
Bitch that shit mean the same thing
But how about I put a couple holes in you and you a window
Oh, that was garbage? Well let me see, you gay, you ain't in a closet
'Cause we all see you gay, you in a window
I really showed up this time, I ain't finesse you bitch, did that surprise you?
Oh, so you ain't tell all these motherfuckers about how when was finna battle before and you sent that five through
And I ain't show up, bitch I fried you
Reason being, he had my nigga Cal come all the way to Vegas and never showed up or paid him
So guess who I gave that five to? Me, motherfucker
You know what else I don't like about your soft ass, dog?
Nigga I got a whole list of thangs
And in the midst of thangs, this faggot-ass nigga gon' pick my shit out a whole list of names
Compared to what I do on the daily, nigga this a game
If we was the same whip, I'm supercharged, the newer car in a different lane
Now I'm just tryna figure out what the fakin' about
'Cause real talk, you ain't did half the shit that you say you about
You ain't did half the shit that you claim you did
And on top of that the people don't like you ain't who you say-
I know, I know, you ain’t that nigga you say you is
Let me see, you got, QP, Heartless, Remy, 100 Bulletz: Innuendo
Nah, I said QP, get heartless, off that Remy, I throw a 100 bullets in ya' window
Frosted Flake, feelin’ Tony The Tiger great, my nigga keep the views
Moe, tell everybody I wanna make it sweet for you
But I might turn to Ike Turner re-enact that Anna Mae scene with you
So I can at least slap this bitch, since he wanna have his cake and eat it too
Between me and you, my nigga, I can outsmart you in a scheme
The mascot for gettin’ mopped up, well, aren't you Mr. Clean?
No A&R's ever attempted to chart you, interesting
'Cause they know if you did sell, dumb nigga, it'd be far few and between
And what's 'seldom', nigga? That's far few and between
You, check the check which is too far, few in between
I thought bein' smart you'd enter theme, give us a, clean explanation
A nose in need deserves puffs indeed, now that’s a Kleenex-planation
'You know what I don't like about you dog?' That's a Qleen explanation
You a career choke artist, you need, resuscitation
Now this battle rap shit show and tell, you gon' need, presentation
See you done learned but you done forgot, see this yo' re-education
You know practice makes perfect and you gon' need, preparation
You know how you know your soul sent, when you see levitation
Now that's altitudes, climbin' through, peaks, elevation
I done doctored this all up, this shit, premeditated
I'ma do, 42 shots, this gon' be, record-breakin’
I hollow man, he see-through, now QP, Kevin Bacon
Yellin' basic, to get rid of this shitstain I'm supposed to shout
I'm feelin’ like Rick James at Eddie Murphy's as he approached the couch
You fool with me not the safe way, even in a frozen, I'll
Mop Qleen up so nasty the cashier come it’ll gross her out
He from the Motor City, I know, you got that motor mouth
I always get told yes my nigga, somethin’ that you don't know about
I'm like umpires sittin’ at home signalin', I'm always showin’ out
This shit, Corey Holcomb material, nothin’ you should joke about
See what's cold is now, you goin’ against a draft so you not playin’ to win
Stop sayin’ shit that don't mean shit else, when you say it again
Or I'll Stephen King kill a clown if I have to say it again
Stephen King, killer clown, do I have to say It, again?
You know what I don't like about you dog? When you say it again
'Cause it don't mean shit else, I mean, they could pretend
When I say it again, you know, since I made up the trend
It's a double meaning on the double meanin’, I move the pace up again
I get paid through Western Union, money grams, pay stubs, depends
You fabricated so it seems you should be makin’ amends
Every rule or regulation you either break or you bend
I should go tee off on this bearded lady, sideburn style, straight for the chin
Now, did you really not write a third round? Only time will tell
You won't be able to see your way, out of this one, you can't provide the skill
You slippin’ with them gun bars that you done tried and failed
'Cause once your chrome'll spark, I guess I got Jonah's heart, 'cause I'm still alive and well
Let me tell y'all niggas why I stopped fuckin' with this battle rap shit dog, 'cause it’s pointless dog
A nigga like him, jump in this bitch all day and do all this fuckin’ ramblin’ bro and never get the fuckin' point across
So I'ma save the, oohs and ahs, for the third round
This one, I'ma just get my point across
I heard somebody say when I walked in this bitch they glad the real came back
I'ma let yo' soft-ass know, off top, it ain't a game scrap
When you spittin’, keep yo' range, nigga hang back 'cause my nigga Money Maine strapped
You in the Midwest where shit can get fuckin' wild, this ain't southern Cal where it never rained at
It still ain't rained yet?
It ain't no question about where these motherfuckers  want the name at
You gotta look at that shit from the world eyes
You made that shit, west coast local, I made it worldwide
Bitch you'll never get my name back
You never made it to where the big stage was at
It was never no need for me to outline you bitch 'cause I always outshined you and you hate that
But let's face facts, real niggas don't wanna hear that lame rap, so nigga can you blame Smack?
Now I want y'all to take this thought for the mind
And don't get me to gettin’ it wrong, I give it to dog, he smart with the lines, lyin' about how he sparkin’ the nine
Now he even walk with the pride
But how he present it, and talk it is jive
He wanted so bad to get that look from Smack
So I know, every time you thought in yo' mind about how you took the back to Heartless and Con, boy that-
If we speakin’ real nigga shit, this man is an act, we gon' take it from that Swave situation
'Cause that's what led me to believe you just another lame nigga fakin’
'Cause in all yo' verses, you handlin’ straps
But that nigga touch you and you let that man give you a panic attack
Not me, that's ironic, he the clown, but I'm the one that's known for jokin’
I don't give a fuck, a nigga touch me, trust me nigga, my chrome is smokin’
Swave? I woulda laid that big nerd down, third round, my hands woulda went around his neck since I'm known for chokin’
Now this nigga mentioned, before I was ever mentioned, you had a million views right?
I give you that, so that mean all these motherfuckers came here to see you right?
To fuck up dirtbox
Go on YouTube, hit that search box
Nigga I'm the only QP you notice
Temptations nigga, you been hatin', nobody comin' to see you Otis

I said he ain't lie, two years ago I had my syrup league, contract this, crip right out the blue
Even though you were amongst those gettin’ eaten, and havin’ dine-out reviews
I was in this kid's corner, hell I took time out for you
Figured like a pirate I'd patch it up and, keep an eye out for you
400 dollar deposit months before it even happened
Then I went to jail for weed infractions, I heard he was smackin'
No-show after no-show, that's a re-enactment of how he was actin’
He started burnin’ bridges, few'll say 'cause he was gassin'
But they gon' have to point someone to ya' aid 'cause I'm bringin’ magic
You ain't know who you was fuckin’ with online, now you're bein' catfished
I would swing over a burner: that's kitchen cabinets
You'd be dealin’ with some assault without, hittin’ backflips
Attractive, trained, steamed, I'm a boilermaker
That'll leave this panhandler MIA, that's a Florida Gator
You, Charmin soft, thank you for the favor
I make sure you get that issue, same shit, different toilet paper
No make sure you get that, tissue, I aim shit, different toilet paper
I was supposed to fade ya', UFC.com, we was supposed to fight on sight
Even with Kevin Hart's father's heart you gettin’ all, right all rights
I'll positively charge at him, split you up right on splice
This part'll cool you down when you put your eye on, ice
You spent your life on white, oh now I get it, Qleen Pacino
Keep it a hundred, before this battle when was the last time you seen a C-note?
You act with my dinero, I'll turn into the last movie scene 'cause he know
It's to the cornfields off that, and short you gon' be DeVito
Well, not DeVito, Joe Pesci, but y'all get it, they both short as fuck
It's like every battle Paper gets ripped but also tore it up
It’s a fact, you a quack, it woulda benefited you more to duck
'Cause this rebound battle is gonna be, what get you boarded up
Now, you more than stuck on Smack for two years, in vain, I been watchin’ things
Coke, Cained you, murdered you brother, enablin' a prophecy
That make ya' nostrils sting, you woulda had more appeal, if you were a Roxy fiend
Since that white powder keep gettin’ you washed up, try oxy Qleen

See he couldn't a' did no homework, give a fuck what this nerd say
You must ain't see the John John battle, when I told niggas fuck what they heard and say
Bitch I bet you I got that third today
This 'bout to be the most ridiculous round
'Cause this shit get more ridiculous every round, dog
Now y'all gon' go crazy and flip after I let this round off
The fuck, y'all ain't get it? I said y'all gon' flip after I let this round off
Nah, I said dog gon' flip after I let this round off
I couldn't lose if I threw this fight purposely
Now if you a fan of the real QP, and you be site-searchin' me
Then you know it's no way possible this bitch might murder me
Now y'all might notice a slight urgency
With me tryna get it out, like I'm tryna get in and out, like burglaries
Everything about this man say nice: courtesy
Me? Whenever my cash gone I throw that mask on like flight emergencies
Quentin Hinton ain't tough, he would never think of anything like hurtin' me
He just talkin' trash, I spark his ass, open him up, like surgery
'Catch his walkin' ass at the bus stop, bust shots and leave him lyin' on the bench like perjury
All y'all gon' hear is ch-ch boom, ch-ch boom, ch-ch boom
Like that shotty,  spittin' bombs
I'ma have everybody stretched out in this nigga yard
Lookin' like he holdin' a class, for Pilates, in his lawn
But make it fast, 'cause fuckin' with his fakin' ass, police probably, get along
And ain't no fear in me bro, so let your cheerleaders know, I'm catchin' bodies, with my arm
Nigga that Glock stick to me, I am velcro strapped
You? You? A ho for starters, niggas can tell by your whole persona you ain't never held no straps
Up here talkin' 'bout offin' me
Naw, niggas be cautious 'bout crossin' me, I'm like railroad tracks
You disrespected my nigga Tall T
Rest in peace, that's a real nigga, it just so happened that Tall T rap
"Fuck that nigga"? Nigga I'll kill your bitch ass to bring Tall T back
Hit his block, two Glocks under that tall T strapped
He's talkin' all that Tall T this and Tall T that
What you gon' do when I send you up where Tall T at?Embed
