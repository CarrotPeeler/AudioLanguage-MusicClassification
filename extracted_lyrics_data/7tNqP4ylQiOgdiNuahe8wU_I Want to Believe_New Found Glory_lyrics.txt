1 ContributorI Want To Believe LyricsFeels like a powder keg, exploding in my head
I think it's time I gave it some attention
Silhouettes back at your expense
Forgetting all the soul in their expressions
Let's face it, you're a business man
Who has a way with his words
Put your money where your mouth is
Give me something that I can sing
It's in your eyes: you're lacking honesty
You traded in your heart and emotion
You barely break it open
I wanna believe but believing is not for me
So put your money where your mouth is
It's a revolving door, you're always wanting more
But there's no room for truth in their intentions
It should be something more
Than bright lights and crowds for you
Something more, something that I hold true
Don't wake me until you finally have directionSee New Found Glory LiveGet tickets as low as $201You might also likeEmbed
