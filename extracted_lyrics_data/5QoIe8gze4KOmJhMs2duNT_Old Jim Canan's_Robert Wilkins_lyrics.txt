I'd take my babe back to old Jim Canan's
I wished i was back at old Jim Canan's
I'd take my babe back to old Jim Canan's
I wished i was back at old Jim Canan's
I'd stand on the corner and wave my hand
Sayin' if you don't believe that I'm a drinkin' man
Then baby stop by here with your beer can
Because i wished i was back at old Jim Canan's
I'd take my babe back to old Jim Canan's
I wished i was back at old Jim Canan's
I'd take my babe back to old Jim Canan's
I wished i was back at old Jim Canan's
I'd take my babe back to old Jim Canan's
I'm goin' uptown, buy me coke and beer
Comin' back and tell you how these women here
They drink their whiskey drink the coke and gin
When you don't pay the double they will ease you in
Still i wished i was back at old Jim Canan's
I'd take my babe back to old Jim Canan's
I wished i was back at old Jim Canan's
I'd take my babe back to old Jim Canan's
I wished i was back at old Jim Canan's
I'd take my babe back to old Jim Canan's
The men and women runnin' hand in hand
Goin' to and fro to old Jim Canan's
Drinkin' their whiskey and sniffin' cocaine
That's been why i wished i was back at old Jim Canan's
And i wished i was back at old Jim Canan'sYou might also likeEmbed
