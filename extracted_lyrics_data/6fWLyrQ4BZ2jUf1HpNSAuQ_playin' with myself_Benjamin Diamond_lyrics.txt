2 Contributorsjr varsity Lyrics
Hmm, ayy, Dill, you did it again, homie
Shit crazy
Like, bae, don't—
(Let the beat ride out, Ju)
(peso, how you do that?)
Yeah, uh, uh, uh

I keep flame on my hip, hundreds in my pocket
It gets dangerous in here, this ain't for everybody
The stick'll make you disappear, I call it Harry Potter
They say you live by the gun, then you die by it, huh
One behind, I disappear in that wide body
Bro just called a hit for— ah, say he John Gotti
Killer just so concrete, I don't want no apology
Lil' bro just hit for thirty bands, he brought some products in
I been tryna buy my whole hood, boost my economy
Lil Beeno since a lil' kid, I wanted finer things
Always dream bigger, huh, hundreds gave me splinters
Bad bitch, she just want a five-star dinner, huh
Five-star bitch, huh, she knew what I said, huh
I can't lie, she just gave me five-star head, huh
Say she wanna join the gang, this the Cartel, huh
They told me Ju on the beat, this shit hard as hell, huh
In the hood, I rock every diamond, cause I'm comfortable
Bro, I promise I am not the one you wanna run into
Show you how to run a hundred up in a month or two
All I gotta do is watch you niggas and see what not to do
Body's foreign, better watch your toes when I'm comin' through 'Bout to pull it up to Popeyes, I want a number two
'Bout to pull out, all my chains on, it's a light show
No flash, that shit moonwalkin' like I'm Michael
Told myself I'ma tell the truth in these high notes
Niggas know I always got my strap, that's my Bible
That shit so vital, doors suicidal
Niggas always actin' like a bitch, it's so vagina
Who can bulletproof the Benz? Man, I'm tryna find one
You can tell I'm gettin' money, ain't no maybe, kinda
Baby, turn me up, huh, she say I'm the one, huh
Slim waist, when she throw a back, that shit thump
I feel like Lil' Johnny inside, I'm gettin' crunk
Nigga try me, then these blue tips'll make him crump

This like sub VR, huh, I'm in foreign cars, huh
I just took my bitch to Paris, took that shit abroad
Benjamin, that's my twin, can't tell us apart, huh
When you got her out the trenches, shit gon' leave a scar, huh
I need that Ferrari, leave it double parked, huh
VVS is clarity, you can see me in the dark, yeah
I just told my bitch, "I got you, just play your part", huh
Don't be playin' with that knife, can hit me in the heart
Been through so much hardships, girl, that's why I'm heartless
I know bro is not a driver, but he really park shit
Young one come up missin' on the milk carton
Nigga, this the big leagues, you still dreamin' Varsity

Yeah, yeah, on the milk carton
Nigga, this the big leagues, you still dreamin' Varsity
Nigga wanna go against me, that shit like some heart disease
I ain't know that was your bitch, sorry, brother, pardon me, yeah, hmm
You can still get her, huh, I ain't know that was your bitch, you can still get her, huh
Don't be pillow talkin' 'bout me, I'm a real nigga, huh
Nigga, get your bag up, I bet you feel different, yeah

This like sub VR, huh, I'm in foreign cars, huh
I just took my bitch to Paris, took that shit abroad
Benjamin, that's my twin, can't tell us apart, huh
When you got her out the trenches, shit gon' leave a scar, huh
I need that Ferrari, leave it double parked, huh
VVS is clarity, you can see me in the dark, yeah
I just told my bitch, "I got you, just play your part", huh
Don't be playin' with that knife, can hit me in the heart
Been through so much hardships, girl, that's why I'm heartless
I know bro is not a driver, but he really park shit
Young one come up missin' on the milk carton
Nigga, this the big leagues, you still dreamin' Varsity
Mm, on the milk carton
Nigga, this the big leagues, you still dreamin' VarsityEmbed
