1 ContributorDeadEye LyricsI can run a maze in a minute, I got a ton on my mind
I ain't trippin' offa tree nah, it's always somewhere to find
& me I got somethin' to climb, rather quiet got muffler of mime
I got a built in crown, Im all out of fucks, get down
I need a bunch of everything, everything I'm a get it
Never needed a nigga pity, I rather bury the city
I can't trust nobody really, niggas steal it and a question like who really did it
I ain't been good in a minute, it never mattered
My nigga we in it to win it
Think I got zombie vision
Terrorist I got a bomb addiction
Old soul obsessed bout my lawn condition
I gotta cut it up, I gotta cut it up
Think I got zombie vision
Lil nigga need brain, shawty legs tall as me, I do long division
I gotta cut it up, I gotta cut
Think I got zom
Zombie Optics, thinking microscopic
How I’m bout to get bеneath these niggas skin
Imma еvil spirit demon wit da pen and my
Closet packed with hella skeleton
Say my heart cold no blood pumping
And a platinum grill, so I’m sucker proof
But these niggas still love biting on me
Shit ain’t nothing new
I’m indestructible
These niggas suicidal, I don’t ever miss I get the head shot
Got me picking bullets out my lunch now
Who the fuck really want a problem wit us
Feel the thunder clapping from the Reigncloud
Switching style now I see they fangs out
Niggas barely living through the blood drought
Like the Crips running shit I’m crypt keeping on you rap niggas
Boy it’s lights out
Armageddon coming feel like Liu Kang wit the chains on me
Still kicking shit with the grey skin
Fireball coming from my dead hands
Nigga Zombie Vision on me 4K
Body after body gotta full plate a nigga appetite ain’t never satisfied so I eat slow nigga foreplay
Nigga what
You might also likeDay in, day out
Dont give a fuck what they say bout it
You peep the growth, oh Rey sprout
Up from the Earth, a gift and a curse
I rise from the grave, I tear up the turf
Im fit to the letter, that nigga since birth
Been lackin' of cheddar, it just made me better
It just made me clever, don't question my worth
My cook up professional, niggas synthetic, I put my foot in it
Not step on the work
I visit the plug like I'm reverend at church, whats that smell?
Think I peddle the purp
I done died, got myself on my shirt, pay me for the verse put feature in dirt
Searchin' for Garden of Eden, where grass might be greener, can't stop my feet bleedin', don't hurt
Think I got zombie vision
Terrorist I got a bomb addiction
Old soul obsessed bout my lawn condition
I gotta cut it up, I gotta cut cut
Think I got zombie vision
Lil nigga need brain, shawty legs tall as me, I do long division
I gotta cut it up, I gotta cut
Think I got zomEmbed
