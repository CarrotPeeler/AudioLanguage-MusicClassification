1 ContributorManifesto LyricsWe stand for many things
We have the power to stand
We have the power of sound
We have the power of electricity
We have the power of medicine
The medicine
The antidote
The prescription
We have the future vision
We have the vision that comes from within
The power of the creator & the Universe
The tuning fork that's already been given to us from Earth
The inner wisdom
We stand for that wisdom
We stand strong for that wisdom
We are willing to fight for that wisdom
That has already been given to us
That we already know
That we already feel inside of ourselves
We are warriors in the sound and our strength and our ancestry
We come from wast people
Ancient people
People that have been in this land and all lands for many years
That represent the inner wisdom
The strength of the creator
The strength of the Earth
The strength of the Universe
We take these tools and we use these tools to present music, message, power, wisdom and all beautiful things that the creator has already given to us
We will fight for that
This is our right
It's our right to represent our music
It's our right to represent what we know
It's our right to stand firm
To stand strong
To walk the Earth
It is our right to heal ourselves everyday with our own medicine and our own strength
We come forth in this Earth to bring message
That is our life's worth
It's undeniable and sometimes to some people unbelievable
And for some they fear
They fear the things that they don't see in themselves
And that's okay because we all have to start somewhere
But the strength and power of the creator and the medicine that has an ancient voice is stronger beyond the flesh, beyond the years
It is timeless and time has no ties
We move forward
Blazing trails for our children
Our sons & daughters of the Earth
The message
The message is in the music
The message is in the sound
Prescription is in the Earth
The prescription inside
I represent the people
People that have come before me
I represent my people
I represent my brother
I represent my sister
I represent all the sons & daughters of the Earth that I hear stand forward & express themselves
In the magnitude and the power of the creator that was given to us from Earth
I represent my people
I represent all things that I come from
The music that was played to me
The music that was played for me by my mother and my father
In my living room
In our basements
In our backyards
In our cities
In our dwellings
The music that has been a part of the fabric of the soul
Of who we are
Our trials and tribulations
Our crying
Our slavery
Slavery of external and slavery within
The trials & tribulations of life
The determination to look for something better
Soul music
Soul music as it is
Just that
Music of the soul
The soul crying out
The soul telling the story
The blues of the people
I represent these things
These things are very sacred to me
These things are very sacred to my brothers and my sisters
As they should be sacred to you
Hold fast hold tight in the stronghold
I represent the city beat
I represent the pulse of the street
I represent all the people that have come before me bringing the message
Be it turntable
Be it drum
Be it voice
Be it whatever medium or whatever tool they had at the time and then use innovatively to express themselves to set the pace, the direction
I represent the vinyl
I represent the tape
I represent all things that are authentic and real in this world
The analog
The strength
The feelings
The transference of energy between man-woman-woman-man-child
Creative energy
Power felt
Feelings
Strength inside
We represent the people
We represent the strength
We represent the people that don't have the strength
We represent the people that don't have a voice
We represent the ancient voice
The voice that resounds past and present and into the future
You need to ask yourself
What do you represent?
What do you present?
When you're done asking yourself these questions, what is your prescription?You might also likeEmbed
