But another girl caught his eye
(I'll take you home)
Now you're sitting there all alone
Watching them dance by
(I'll take you home)
And I know you're
Wondering what you'll do
If he doesn't come back to you
But don't worry, I'll take you home
So, little girl, don't you be blue
Now I know that you wore that pretty
Red dress just for him to see
(I'll take you home) mmm, yeah
But I wanna tell you that
Red dress looks good to me
(I'll take you home)
Whoa, I know you
Feel like you wanna die
But try pretending that I'm your guy
And don't worry, I'll take you home
So, little girl, now don't you cry

I'll take you home, just wait and see
You're gonna dance the last dance with me
Let me tell you now
I know the way that you feel
I can understand
(I'll take you home) mmm
Cause I had a date just like you
When the dance began
(I'll take you home)
But the girl I came with just wasn't true
She's the girl who took him from you
So you see now, I'll take you home
Cause, little girl, I'm lonely too
Ohh, let me tell you now
I know the way that you feel
I can understand
(I'll take you home) mmm
Cause I had a date just like you
When the dance began
(I'll take you home)
But the girl I came with just wasn't true
She's the girl who took him from you
So you see now, I'll take you home
Cause, little girl, I'm lonely too
Whoa, oh, oh, oh
I'll take you home
Cause, little girl, I'm lonely too
Mmm mm, yeah
I'll take you home
Cause, little girl, I'm lonely tooEmbed
