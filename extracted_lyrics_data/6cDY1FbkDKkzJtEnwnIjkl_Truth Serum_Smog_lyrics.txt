5 ContributorsTruth Serum LyricsMe and some friends of mine
We stayed up all night taking truth serum
We soon realized the mistake we made
And went our separate separate ways
I went up on the roof
Where I thought I'd find some truth
There beneath the stars
But questions followed me
Do you miss me when I go?
Honey, I love you and that's all you need to know
Well then, what is love?
Love is an object kept in an empty box
How can something be in an empty box?
Well well give me another shot of that truth serum
I went back downstairs to check on my friends
Because truth has a way of beginning an end
Big Bruiser Ken walks in says, "I like men"
I excuse myself and go back up on the roof again
More questions follow me
Is death really the end?
Honey, I love you and that's all you need to know
Well then, what is life?
Well, that's a good song without you by my side
Taking that truth truth truth truth truth serum

There's no truth in you
There's no truth in me
The truth is between
The truth is betweenEmbed
