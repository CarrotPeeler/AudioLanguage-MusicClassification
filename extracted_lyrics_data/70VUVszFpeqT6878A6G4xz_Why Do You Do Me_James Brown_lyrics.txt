5 ContributorsWhy Do You Do Me Lyrics
Why did it happen this way
Someone has taken my place
No one to share my embrace
Why do you do me like you do

I give my heart to you
Like no one else could do
Im just so lonely and blue, oh oh
Why do you do me like you do

Way down inside me
There is no one else but you, oh
Deep down inside me
There is no one else but you

I give my heart to you
Like no one else could do
Im just so lonely and blue, oh
Why do you do me like you do
{Saxophone solo}
You might also like
Way down inside me
There is no one else but you
Deep down inside me
There is no one else but you

I give my heart to you
Like no one, no one else could do
Im just so lonely and blue, oh yeah
Why do you do me like you do, yeah yeahEmbed
