7 ContributorsImpossible Lyrics
Spoke up and thought I'd try
Try to step across the line
You know that I've been thinkin' 'bout it for a while, yeah
Startin' to think it's time I kneel
Does me good to know I finally feel
Feel this pain, it's real, it's possible
You say...

Can't change the winds, you say
Won't matter anyway
Can't reach that far
'Cause it's impossible (It's impossible)
Can't rise above this place
Won't change your mind, so I pray
Breakin' down the walls
Do the impossible (It's impossible)

Walkin' by myself I know
This lonely road's becomin' my new home
But I don't stop, I just keep movin' on, and on
Ain't no need to dry my eyes
I haven't cried in quite some time
Every day I fight it, you know it's possible
You say...
You might also like
Can't change the winds, you say
Won't matter anyway
Can't reach that far
'Cause it's impossible (It's impossible)
Can't rise above this place
Won't change your mind, so I pray
Breakin' down the walls
Do the impossible (It's impossible)

Can someone tell me why
It's so hard takin' chances?
You draw the line and think
That I won't ask for more, yeah
I will stumble
And I'll make my own mistakes, yeah
But I won't worry 'bout it anymore
It's impossible

Can't change the winds, you say
Won't matter anyway
Can't reach that far
'Cause it's impossible (It's impossible)
Can't rise above this place
Won't change your mind, so I pray
Breakin' down the walls
Do the impossible (It's impossible)
It's impossible to you
Not impossible for me
Not impossible for me
Can't rise above this place (It's impossible to you)
Won't change your mind, so I pray (Not impossible for me)
Breaking down the walls (Not impossible for me)
Do the impossible (It's impossible)

Spoke up and though I'd try
Try to step across the line2Embed
