1 ContributorEclosion LyricsAttachment
A firm hand
Solemn ovations
Crude notions
Test the thesis
Father
Seek the symbols
My censor, father
'Cause derived from dreams mesmerize
Down to basics
Infantalized
Find the shape now dwell on the size
All distorted views from a distance
Will form the matter
Consistence
I almost tried to resist
Resist father
Censor father
A firm hand father
Observe
Analyze guide
Take pride
In your own horses
The seeds they sow
Are we this low?
