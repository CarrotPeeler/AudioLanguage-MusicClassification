1 ContributorBlack Summer LyricsGo on let your ears define
Tell me can you walk me there
Enough, I am not
Enough, I am not real
Go on let your ears define
Tell me if you want me still
Enough, I am not
Enough, I'm a lot less
Back doors are swinging
All black is it to defend
I'm going to walk back injured
I'm going to walk back injured
I'm going to walk back into it
All that you said is heartfelt
Nobody's protest, it's nobody's protest
It's nobody's protest
All that you said is haunted
Nobody's protest, it is nobody's protest
It is nobody's protest it is
Heartbroken
I breath it

Cutting a million tracks
Folded but I'm rolling
What are the reasons
Don't wanna to walk back, that's the spirit
Love you fellow
Dull black summer
Can you read the sign
To an awful setting
Telling public lies
Different colors
Different light that hope you trigger's
Talking to my eyesEmbed
