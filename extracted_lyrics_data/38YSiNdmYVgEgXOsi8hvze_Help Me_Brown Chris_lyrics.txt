Oh, oh, oh

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

You look (So) so (Good) good, I can't believe it
I'm out (My) my mind (Mind), I shouldn't be but, oh

Women like you steal my control (Oh, oh)
Scene of the crime, my spot is next door (Oh, oh)
Come on (Girl), girl, don't (Girl, don't)
Be scared (Be scared), now, baby

Help me, help me, help me
I want you to help me, help me, help me
I can't stop myself, you effing lovely
I wanna have you screaming, love you roughly (Yeah, yeah)
I need a little bit of help, keep raising the body count
Whenever I take 'em out, I end up taking 'em down
Can you help me, help me, help me?
Shoot me or something
To help me, help me, help me
Do me or something, I need help
