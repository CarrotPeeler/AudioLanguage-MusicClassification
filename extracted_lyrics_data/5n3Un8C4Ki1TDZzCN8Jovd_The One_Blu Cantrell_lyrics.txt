2 ContributorsThe One Lyrics
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Whoa, oh-oh

I've been looking for a man to stay here 'til the end
He will not just be my lover, he'll be my best friend
He will always be a guiding force in my life
Pick me up when I am down, and then he'll hold me tight

He will never leave me standing in the pouring rain
He will never disrespect me, call me out my name
He will never have me waiting 'til the morning comes
I will always be his baby when it's said and done

'Cause he'll be the one
'Cause he'll be the one
'Cause he'll be the one
'Cause he'll be the one, whoa

He will always be the one to wipe away my tears
He will always be the one to kiss away my fears
He will always be there makin' everything alright
Be the one to always love me, no more lonely nights, ooh
You might also like
He will never leave me standing in the pouring rain
He will never disrespect me, call me out my name
He will never have me waiting 'til the morning comes
I will always be his baby when it's said and done

'Cause he'll be the one
(He will never leave me standing in the pouring rain)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh-oh-oh

He will never leave me standing in the pouring rain (He'll never leave me standing)
He will never disrespect me, call me out my name  (And never call me out my name)
He will never have me waiting 'til the morning comes (Oh, whoa, whoa)
I will always be his baby when it's said and done (I will always be his baby)
He will never leave me standing in the pouring rain (Oh yeah yeah, yeah yeah)
He will never disrespect me, call me out my name (Oh-oh)
He will never have me waiting 'til the morning comes (He'll never)
I will always be his baby when it's said and done
'Cause he'll be the one
He will never disrespect me, call me out my name (He will never leave me)
He will never have me waiting 'til the morning comes
I will always be his baby when it's said and done
'Cause he'll be the one
Oh-oh-oh, yeah yeahEmbed
