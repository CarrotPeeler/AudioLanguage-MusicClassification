4 ContributorsSomebody Loves Me Lyrics
Here I am again, alone in my lonely room
How can I believe you loved me?
Here I sit, just thinking of it
All the time that we spent together

We were holding hands, making lots of plans
Thick or thin, a lover and a friend to me
You were so easy to love

(How can I believe) How can I believe
(That somebody loves me?) That somebody loves me?

What happened, boy, to the love we shared?
How can I believe you loved me?
I just need to know that you cared
Honetly, is the love still there?

And if you me like you say you do
Why don't we make plans for two?
All I need is some kind of sign

(How can I believe) How can I believe
(That somebody loves me?) That somebody loves me? Yeah

Tell me, how can I, how can I believe (How can I believe)
(That somebody loves me?) Somebody, somebody loves me?
(How can I believe) How can I, how can I believe
(That somebody loves me?) Somebody loves me?
(How can I believe) If you love me, if you love me like you say you do
(That somebody loves me?) How can I believe it, boy? Ooh, ooh, oh
(How can I believe) Honestly, is the love still there?
(That somebody loves me?) All I wanna know is that you care
(How can I believe) That you love me, that you need me
Somebody, somebody, somebody (That somebody loves me?)
How can I believe (How can I believe)
(That somebody loves me?) Believe

(How can I believe) Believe
(That somebody loves me?)
(How can I believe)
(That somebody loves me?)Embed
