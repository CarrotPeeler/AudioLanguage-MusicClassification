25 ContributorsPrecious Possession Lyrics
Hold me close I'm wasting away
Hold me close I'm too fucked to stand

Hold me close I'm wasting away
Hold me close I'm too fucked to stand
Hold me close I'm wasting away
Hold me close I'm too fucked to stand

Blank slate big smile
Nice pout long hair
Toned thighs big legs
Both breasts blank stare
We've learned that this is what you want
We can't erase what we've been taught
Will you call me your girlfriend
I wanna be your princess
Will you call me your girlfriend
I wanna be your princess

Come down on me
I am your precious possession
I'm so delicate
I need your protection
You might also like
Clothes in front of your new daddy
Stick my ass out for all it's worth
Stay like this until the grave daddy
Drop your ass, what's your self esteem worth?

Hold me close I'm wasting away
Hold me close I'm too fucked to stand
Hold me close I'm wasting away
Hold me close I'm too fucked to stand

I'm addicted to myself
I'm addicted to my wealth
I'm lying to myself
(I am your precious possession)
Lying to myself
Put your hands on my face
Put your hands on my waist
Put your hands on my face
(I need your protection)
I'm addicted to myself
I'm addicted to my wealth
I'm lying to myself
(I am your precious possession)
Lying to myself
Put your hands on my face
Put your hands on my waist
Put your hands on my face
(I need your protection)
I'm addicted to myself
I'm addicted to my wealth
I'm lying to myself
(I am your precious possession)
Lying to myself
Put your hands on my face
Put your hands on my waist
Put your hands on my face
(I need your protection)3Embed
