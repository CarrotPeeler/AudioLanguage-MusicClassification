Caught myself digging again
And all that I’ve found as I dig deeper down, my friend
Are these subtle lights
These subtle lights
These subtle lights
(Verse Two)
Sunlight has all disappeared
I haven’t seen it since yesteryear
And all that I hear as throw the earth clear
Is this ringing in my ears
And these subtle lights
These subtle lights
These subtle lights
(Chorus)
Caverns with diamonds and
Riches from carbon sands
Hoping you’ll understand
If I return empty handed
Emeralds and geodes and
All that erodes a man
Love grows in crystal bands
And mining love, that’s my plan
You might also like(Verse Three)
Stop for a moment of rest
Strike a match for a cigarette
Rumblings emerge from the ground
And falling in, all around
Surrounded by
These subtle lights
These subtle lights
Enraptured by
These subtle lights
These subtle lights
(Chorus)
Caverns with diamonds and
Riches from carbon sands
Hoping you’ll understand
If I return empty handed
Emeralds and geodes and
All that erodes a man
Love grows in crystal bands
And mining love, that’s my planEmbed
