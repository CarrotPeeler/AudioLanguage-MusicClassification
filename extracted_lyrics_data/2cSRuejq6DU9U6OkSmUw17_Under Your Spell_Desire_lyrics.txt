I don't eat
I don't sleep
I do nothing but think of you
I don't eat
I don't sleep
I do nothing but think of you

You keep me under your spell
You keep me under your spell
You keep me under your spell
You keep me under your spell
You keep me under your spell
You keep me under your spell
- Hey
- Yeah?
- I was wondering... Do you know the difference between love and obsession?
- No
- And what's the difference between obsession and desire?
- I don't know
- Do you think this feeling could last forever?
- You mean like... Forever ever? Forever ever? Forever ever? Forever ever? Sure!
- God, I hope so
- Me too!

You keep me under your spell
You keep me under your spell
You keep me under your spell
You keep me under your spell
You keep me under your spell
