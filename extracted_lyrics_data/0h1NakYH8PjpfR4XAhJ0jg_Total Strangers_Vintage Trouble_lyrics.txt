Stop acting like a teenage child
Let’s make something disappear
Like rapid fire burning wild
We can’t afford to miss this
Primitive, raw connection
I said get over here
For the resurrection
LET’S MAKE IT
LOVE ABOVE THE COVER
LIKE TOTAL STRANGERS
GET NAKED
LOVE ABOVE THE COVER
LIKE YOU KNOW ME
AND I DON’T KNOW YOU
LIKE WE AINT EVER DONE WHAT WE’RE ABOUT TO DO
LIKE TOTAL STRANGERS
Quit playing. Get to it now
Blow me up then wet me down
Don’t make me chase you around and around
That’s not what tonight’s gonna be about
Dig in with your fingers
Scratch tracks down my back like a wild cat
Get to it now
Grind your spine like a maniac

LOVE ABOVE THE COVERS
LIKE TOTAL STRANGERS
GET NAKED
LOVE ABOVE THE COVERS
LIKE YOU KNOW ME
AND I DON’T KNOW YOU
LIKE WE AINT EVER DONE WHAT WE’RE ABOUT TO DO
LIKE TOTAL STRANGERS
LET’S MAKE IT
LOVE ABOVE THE COVERS
LIKE TOTAL STRANGERS
GET NAKED
LOVE ABOVE THE COVERS
LIKE YOU KNOW ME
AND I DON’T KNOW YOU
YOU KNOW YOU WANT IT
LOVE ABOVE THE COVERS
LIKE TOTAL STRANGERS
HOP ON IT
LOVE ABOVE THE COVERS
LIKE WE AINT EVER DONE WHAT WE’RE ABOUT TO DO
