34 ContributorsWhat Do They Know? Lyrics
Beat me up, beat me down
Mess me up beyond all recognition
For what it's worth, I'd do it again
With no consequence, I will do it again
Hard up, so hunt me down, down, down
Jump the gun, bust a cap, hit the ground!

Yo, yo, yo, word
My dignity's never returned
Perceived like a big fat jerk
I've been silly, but not absurd
Criminal, that's what I herd
Thinking thoughts that's most impure
No efforts expenditured
I'm just that soup de jour’d

On the fence, the consequence
What do they know about that?
On the track, ahead of the pack
What do they know about that?
I'm quite impressed, I'm quite a mess

Beat me up, beat me down
Mess me up beyond all recognition
For what it's worth, I'd do it again
With no consequence, I will do it again
Hard up, so hunt me down, down, down
Jump the gun, bust a cap, hit the ground!

I been silly, but not absurd
Criminal, that's what I herd
Thinking thoughts that's most impure
No efforts expenditured
I'm just that soup de jour’d

On the fence, the consequence
What do they know about that?
On the track, ahead of the pack
What do they know about that?
I'm quite impressed, I'm quite a mess

Hey, I'm someone to stab in the back
Hey, I'm someone to fall through the crack
Hey, I'm someone to punch in the face
Hey, I'm someone to fall through the crack
Written all over my face, written all over my face
Written all over my face, written all over my face
Written all over my face, written all over my face
Written all over my face, written all over my face!
Jump the gun, bust a cap, hit the ground
Yo, yo, yo, word
My dignity's never returned
Perceived like a big fat jerk
I been silly, but not absurd
Criminal that's what I herd
Thinking thoughts that's most impure
No efforts expenditured
I'm just that soup de jour’d

On the fence, the consequence

On the track, ahead of the pack
What do they know about that?
I'm quite impressed, I'm quite a mess6Embed
