4 ContributorsTraveling Alone Lyrics
When I was questioned, I shook my head and stared
I was traveling alone and had nothing to declare
He asked how I knew for sure
And would I tell everyone I knew
If it would hurt to know the truth

I can be thankful to be alive but I despise this life
In all my years, at best, I've only learned just to survive
But when I look around you, I understand why you believe
I see your evidence of God all around me
You have so therefore you are, but I have not
You've seen the evidence of God but I have not and I have none

I shook my head and laughed
I never had a taste for life
And I felt there was no turning back
Would I try to take away their hope
Replace it with reality?
Exchange their joy with my bleak view
And leave them miserable like me?

I have searched and I have tried to find a place where I can be
I love my homeland dearly but never carved a place in society
But when I look around you, I understand why you believe
I see your evidence of God all around me
You have so therefore you are, but I have not
You are too rich for hate, and I'm too poor to love
You might also like
When I asked him, he shook his head and stared
"I see no evidence of God in the men from the west"Embed
