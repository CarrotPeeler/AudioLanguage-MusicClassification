Teenage love, no, no, don't hurt me again
Teenage love, yo, yo, don't hurt me again
Teenage love, yo, yo, don't hurt me again

Never again will
Never again will I fall in love
Never again will
Never again will I be the fool

You were my first true love
Since childhood
I knew ya
You promised
Forever
And always
Together
No, it ain't right
(No, it just ain't right)

Never again will
Never again will I fall in love (No, no, no)
Never again will
Never again will I be the fool
Never again will
Never again will I say I love you (Ooh yeah)
Never again will
Never again will I fall into your arms
You might also like
Trying to forget you
Is so hard
For me to do
You loved me
So easy
Then left me
So lonely
I dream of you
I still do
Even though
You were untrue
Pretending
To love me
No, it ain't right
(No, it just ain't right)

Never again will (No, no, no, no)
Never again will I fall in love
Never again will
Never again will I be the fool
(Don't wanna be no fool)

Oh, you told me
You loved me
Just to get
What you want
Then you left me
In misery
Oh, just ain't right, just ain't right
Never again will
Never again will I fall in love
(Oh no, no, no, no, no
I don't wanna fall in love with you, girl)
Never again will
Never again will I be the fool
(I don't wanna be a fool, no no)
Never again will (No, no)
Never again will I say I love you (I don't wanna be)
I love you (I don't love you no more), I love you

Never again
(I love you) (Ain't gon' do it no more)
Never again (Ooh no)
