Ask me again I'll tell you the same
Puddin' n' tain, puddin' n' tain
Ask me again I'll tell you the same
Puddin' n' tain, puddin' n' tain
Ask me again I'll tell you the same
You won't believe this story
While I was walking one bright and sunny day
I met a little sweet, sweet girl
Who chanced to walk my way
I asked her, her name
Here's what she said to me
Puddin' n' tain, puddin' n' tain
Ask me again I'll tell you the same
Oh, golly gee
If she would only belong to me
And I would tellw the world
The whole wide world
That I'm in love with
Puddin' n' tain, puddin' n' tain
Ask me again I'll tell you the same

She's so sweet just my kind
All because she's pretty
All because she's fine
I want this girl to be mine
Now we're going steady
And I've found out her real name is Betty
I'll tell the world the whole wide world
That I'm in love with
Puddin' n' tain, puddin' n' tain
Ask me again I'll tell you the same
Now we're going steady
And I've found out her real name is Betty
And I'll tell the world the whole wide world
That I'm in love with
Puddin' n' tain, puddin' n' tain
Ask me again I'll tell you the same
