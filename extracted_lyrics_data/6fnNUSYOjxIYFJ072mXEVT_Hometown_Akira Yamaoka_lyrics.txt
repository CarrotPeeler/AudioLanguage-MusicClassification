7 ContributorsHometown Lyrics
He spoke of tortured souls
So outrageous the toll, you can lose all you have
He refused to give in to the town that takes all
Survive, you must have the will
This movie doesn't end the way we want
All the time, then he shouts at the moon...

"She's gone," and fear has overcome
He was walking the mile, he was walking alone

So outrageous the toll, you can lose all you have
He refused to give in to the town that takes all
Survive, you must have the will
This movie doesn't end the way we want
All the time, then he shouts at the moon...

"She's gone," and fear has overcome
He was walking the mile, he was walking alone

Four and twenty dead birds, they bleed upon the nest
There was no time for reason, they had no sign of a threat
Now it's too late, too late for me
This town will eventually take me
Too late, too late for me, this town will win

Through this fog, they came along
Dark creatures singing a terrible song
The rest of the bar laughed at him
Only I felt my hope grow dim
They found him dead, the very next day
No more stories from him, I heard them say
We blamed bad luck for his fate
Only I felt terror so great

She and he will know
That someday, all things will end
That misty night, that dismal moon
The dead search for their kin
While angels sing in endless dark
The dead seek out sinEmbed
