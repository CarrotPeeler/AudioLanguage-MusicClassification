4 ContributorsSex Girl Lyrics
Shorty (Yeah), shorty, hey, shorty
Tell me what you wanna do with me, yeah
Let's go (Let's go)
Yes, I wanna see you get low (Get low)
Yeah (Yeah)
Get low (Get low)
Let me see you wind your body real slow

She turned around
That's when she had me right there
The most beautiful girl in here
Is giving off a flair
But I'ma play it cool
I'ma be cavalier
Another glance and I'ma go over
Hey pretty girl, I'm tryin' to get to know ya
My name is J, baby, what's your name?

Take time, t-time and waitin' (Mmm, no, no, no)
Got my body gettin' impatient (I can't help it)

I can't help but want your (Sex, girl)
Beautiful (Sex girl)
Thinkin' 'bout (Sex, girl)
You and your (Sex, girl)
I want it, baby (Sex, girl)

Thinkin' 'bout (Sex, girl)

A pretty smile, thin waist with a bump in the back

So baby, tell me if you're down with that, my sex girl
I can tell you like to get a little freaky
How many different ways can you tease me?
Ooh, you got me like a rocket
The way you slide on the pole, I wanna rock it
I'll lay you down on the Cali king
Make love to your body passionately
And every time you think about it

But you and I can make love, yeah
