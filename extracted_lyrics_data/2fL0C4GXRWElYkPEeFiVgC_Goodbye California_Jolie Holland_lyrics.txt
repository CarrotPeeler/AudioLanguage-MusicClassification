3 ContributorsGoodbye California LyricsI'm pre-meditating crime of a personal kind
I'm about to go out of my mind
I'm just about sick to death of taking breath
And walking this line of mine
Now, folks that know what's good for 'em are good at ignoring 'em
But I just can't put these thoughts down
I'm harrowed and abused and broken and pursued
By this notion that follows me around
My heart is hurting, my spirit's burdened
I feel like a liar and a thief
For taking air, for being here unwanted
I look for my final release
Goodbye, goodbye, California
Goodbye and I'll be moving on
I sang you my songs, I know I'm wrong
Fare thee well and I'll be moving on
When I'm dead and gone
My immortal home will hold me in its bosom safe and cold
No more desires will light their fires
Or disturb my immaculate calm
And the birds of the air
And the beasts of the soil
And the fishes of the desperate sea
Will know who I am
And our substance will expand
As part of everything
You might also likeAs part of everything, my God
As part of everything
And the clouds will roll
And the wind will blow
And the beautiful birds will sing
Goodbye, goodbye, California
Goodbye to your waving trees
To you succulent wind and all my friends
Fare thee well
Goodbye
So be it
Amen
AmenEmbed
