1 ContributorGet Out of My Way LyricsGet out of my way
Get out of my way
Calling for the stop
Get us breath away
Brace yourself for the sloth
It's bad about your day
Get out of my way
Get out of my way
Get out of my way
This is for the illusion
Can I smash your day?
Brace yours for our show
My Christ has been betrayed
Get out of my way
Get out of my way
Get out of my way
Calling for the stop
Get us breath away
Brace yourself for the sloth
