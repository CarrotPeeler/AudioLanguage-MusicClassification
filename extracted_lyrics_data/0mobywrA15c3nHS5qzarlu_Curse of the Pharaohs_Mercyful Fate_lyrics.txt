13 ContributorsCurse of the Pharaohs Lyrics
Away out in Egypt in the Valley of Kings
Where the mummified pharaohs
Pretend dead in their sleep, yeah

Well, don't touch, never ever steal
Unless you're in for the kill
Or you'll be hit by the Curse of the Pharaohs (Ahh, oh!)
Yes you'll be hit and the Curse is on you


Now if you're breaking the seals
And disturbing the peace
Then you're starting up a Curse
Bringing evil disease, yeah

Don't touch, never ever steal
Unless you're in for the kill
Or you'll be hit by the Curse of the Pharaohs (Ahh, oh!)
Yes you'll be hit and the Curse is on you

I'll be your pharaoh
You might also like
The curse of the pharaohs can be so deadly
Or just destroying your future
Making it all shady, yeah

So don't touch, never ever steal
Unless you're in for the kill (Kill, kill)
Or you'll be hit by the Curse of the Pharaohs (Ahh, oh!)
Yes you'll be hit and the Curse is on you

Yeah, yeah!Embed
