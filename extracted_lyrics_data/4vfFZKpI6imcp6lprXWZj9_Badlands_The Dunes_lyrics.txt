1 ContributorDrying Out In The Sun LyricsWe're fading spots on the horizon
Flecks of dust in the dunes
Pieces of brocken rock
Falling off the edge of the moon
We're slipping from the top container
Losing air among the bottom grains
Keeping our hands up only for signs of impossible rain
While everything around me goes up in flames
I dream myself back to the shadow of your name
From the sky and down to the ground
It's a crying shame
I have no one but myself to blame
For drying out in the sun
Drying out in the sun
Drying out in the sun (x2)
Are my ears
Playing tricks on me?
Do I hear the tides of a new sea
Rising up
From underneath the burning sands?
Echos from the walls of the wells
Waves against waves as the ocean swells
To swallow up every corner and crack of these badlands
You might also likeWhile everything around me wavers in the heat
I dream myself back on my own two feet
From the sky and down to the ground
It's a crying shame
I have no one but myself to blame
For drying out in the sun
Drying out in the sun
Drying out in the sun
Drying out in the sun
Drying out in the sun
Drying out in the sun
I'm drying out in the sun
Drying out in the sun
Drying out in the sun
Drying out in the sun
Drying out in the sun
Drying out in the sun
I'm drying out in the sun
Drying out in the sun
Drying out in the sun
Drying out in the sun
Drying out in the sun
Drying out in the sun
I'm drying out in the sun
Drying out in the sun
Drying out in the sun (x2)Embed
