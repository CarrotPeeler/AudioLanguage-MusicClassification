For this affection to come alive
All morals slips away
On the dancefloor in the fog
In lights and stroboscope
Your body moves
In tights and skirts and boots
Press your heartbeat tight on mine
Your lips, your respiration
Infect me with your eternal crime
Your curves, your asphyxiation
Send me a shiver down my spine
Your blood, your sweet temptation
Let this moment be divine
My ruin is your salvation

Three steps forth and back again
Like innocence is lost
And whores are born
Press your heartbeat tight on mine
Your lips, your respiration
Infect me with your eternal crime
Your curves, your asphyxiation
You might also likeSend me a shiver down my spine
Your blood, your sweet temptation
Let this moment be divine
My ruin is your salvationEmbed
