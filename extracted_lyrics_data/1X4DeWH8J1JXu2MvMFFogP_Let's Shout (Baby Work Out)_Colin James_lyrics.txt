Come out here on the floor
Let's rock some more
Come out here on the floor
Honey, let's rock some more, yeah!
Now when you get out here
Don't you have no fear
Put your hands on your hips
And let your backbone slip
And work out
Momma, move up
Honey move back
Shuffle to the left
Wobble to the right
Now it's plain to see
You put a hurtin' on me
It's a natural fact
I like it like that
So work out!
Yeah, baby let's shout
Chop, shout and turn it out
Baby let's shout
Shout and work it out. Yeah
Let's shout!
Let's shout!
Shout all night long!

Round and round we go
Where we stop, nobody knows
Round and round we go
Don't you know, don't you know
Yeah
The band is swinging on the stand
We're moving in, we're moving out
If we'll step back now end this dance with a shout
So let's shout!
Yeah, baby let's shout
Chop and shout and work it out
Baby, let's shout!
Chop and shout and work it out
Yeah
Let's shout, let's shout, shout all night long!
Yeah now baby

Workout now woman
Let's shout, let's shout, shout all night long!Embed
