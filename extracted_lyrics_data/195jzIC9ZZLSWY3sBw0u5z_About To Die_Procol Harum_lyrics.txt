2 ContributorsAbout To Die LyricsAbout to die - the crowds applaud you
Afraid to die - they'll resurrect you
Light a candle up in kingdom come
Light the way for the Saviour's son
A candle burning bright enough to tear the city down
About to die - the crowds reward you
About to die - their cheers ignore you
Light a candle up in kingdom come
Light the way for the chosen one
No candle burned with fire enough to tear that city down
About to die - the crowds applaud me
Afraid to die - they'll resurrect me
Light a candle up in kingdom come
Light the way for the Saviour's son
A candle burning bright enough to tear the city downYou might also likeEmbed
