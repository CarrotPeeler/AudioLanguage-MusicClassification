That I never need it
My hands on the wheel, my foot's on the steel
'Cause I gotta feel it
The rock rolls forever on - ooh, forever on
Like thunder - coming down, ooh, yeah
The rock rolls forever on - ooh, forever on
Like thunder - coming down, ooh, yeah
It blows through my veins like thunder and rain
And I can't live without it
I scream for the crowds, and turn it up loud
'Cause I gotta feel it
The rock rolls forever on - ooh, forever on
Like thunder - coming down, oh it's coming down, yeah
The rock rolls forever on - ooh, forever on
Like thunder - coming down, ooh, yeah
Six string and lightning strikes
Come make me blind
Ooh burn it up
Bring down the pedal to the metal
Just one me time
Burn it up
