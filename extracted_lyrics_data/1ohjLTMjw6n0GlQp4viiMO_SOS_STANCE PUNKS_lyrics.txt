2 ContributorsGo For What You Know Lyrics(Instrumental)
(Ooh, Uh, Ooh, Uh, Ooh, Uh, Ooh)

I’ll break chicks like sticks
Twigs with wigs
Better take attendance, dig this
I took a break and I broke
But I won’ choke, I’m no’ joke, I won’ budge
Streak, stain, smear, or smudge
Just beat her n’ treat her like a sister
She said, “Hit me!” Ayo, hit her!
Now here we go, want an Antoinette trip?
While I play, we’ll sit and flip
Trix are for kids, and I ain’t kiddin’
This is the gangstress and I’m gettin’ doper
You wanna wish? Be a hoper
I put heads to bed so I woke ‘em
I’m incredible, rhymes are edible
And the name, Antoinette, is unforgettable
So ladies and gentlemen, get ready for the write-up
Clap your hands, ‘cuz I’m about to light up
(Instrumental)

I don’t play, I bring names down
How that game sound?
I ain’t James Brown
So roll the static when A’s on rampage
You step to this, and you stuck on band-aids
You sought nonsense, and that makes no sense
When I start to drop it, you get tense
Veins are bulging, punks stand frozen
So was wisely chosen to keep my flows in
I declare war
You need repair, or a tune-up
Yo, this time or sooner
So go, for once, y’know, quick and don’t miss
So you feel a mic around a foot or a fist
Escapism, that’s what you thought
Rhymes are smokin’, just like Newport
Might ignite like a matchlight
You can’t see clear, then go get a flashlight
I win, you lose, ‘cuz yo, I’m an outlaw
Step seven, now draw
You too late, too slow, too soft, too weak
I hold crowds when I speak
I trample, so yo, who’s next up?
They’ll get beat down, shook up, messed up
Wreckin’ mics and you’ll get wiped up
Antoinette plus this means hyped up
Formulas that cure
I ain’t  but I’ll be sure
(Instrumental)
(Ooh, Uh, Ooh, Uh, Ooh, Uh)

I’ll smother, so cover your behind, right?
Or you can’t kiss where the sun don’t shine bright?
‘Cuz minimum wage is a wack off stages
They can’t say this, so I play with
Homicide which equals Antoinette
The queen of soul, so yo, you can’t forget
It’s facts, so don’t say you see me yap
My rap is hyper than a hypermaniac
I move smooth yet groove
I damage and then prove
So join the gangstress y’all, and pump this
I picked up the notes like blow to a trumpet
Yo, you want this, but you can’t fit this
So come on y’all, and let’s all kick this
Assault, battery, manslaughter
You’re just a daughter, so cancel that order
Who’s the best, ya got one pick
It ain’t me? Then shit, you better run quick
I’m the boss, so don’t say, “She’s hot”
You’re just a copy, a sloppy xerox
(Instrumental)
(Uh, Ooh, Uh, Ooh, Uh, Ooh)Embed
