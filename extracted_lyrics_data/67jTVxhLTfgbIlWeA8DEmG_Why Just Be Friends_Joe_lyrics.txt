3 ContributorsWhy Just Be Friends Lyrics
Sure baby we could be friends
(Slow dance, romance, back rubs
Hiked up, slowly
That's us rolling in the meadow
When we do it all)
(Slow dance, romance, back rubs
Hiked up, slowly
That's us rolling in the meadow
When we do it all)
(Quite possibly we could be one
Just you and me
So why just be friends)
And all you gotta do is take it off
(Take off your coat)
And all you gotta do it take it off
(That's what I wanna do)
And all you gotta do is take it off
(Baby kick off your shoes)
And all you gotta do is take it off
(Let's be more then just friends)

Girl just relax
I know we just started talking
Girl I can't help but to think
Of how we'd be
We could sail the seven seas
Like it was a dream
We could climb
The highest mountain
If you know what I mean
Or just chill
And watch a movie or the TV
Baby you just got to trust
I promise you'll see

Stop, drop your fears
Baby come get with me
Give me your tears
I got the remedy
Take down your shield
I'm not the enemy
Girl
I just wanna be the only one
Who can make you happy
Baby come close
I want to feel your body
Take it slow
Ain't gotta follow nobody
We can't go wrong
Baby just think about it

Sure baby we could be friends
(Slow dance, romance, back rubs
Hiked up, slowly
That's us rolling in the meadow
When we do it all)
(Slow dance, romance, back rubs
Hiked up, slowly
That's us rolling in the meadow
When we do it all)
(Quite possibly we could be one
Just you and me
So why just be friends)
And all you gotta do is take it off
(Take off your coat)
And all you gotta do it take it off
(That's what I wanna do)
And all you gotta do is take it off
(Baby kick off your shoes)
And all you gotta do is take it off
(Let's be more then just friends)

I don't want
To move you fast
But girl I'm ready
No pressure girl
Just sit back
And let it in
If I'm rushing
Baby girl just let me know
It ain't no thing for me
To take it slow
I ain't trying
To make you feel
Uncomfortable
But I can't help feeling
Like you're the one
I'm looking for
Stop, drop your fears
Baby come get with me
Give me your tears
I got the remedy
Take down your shield
I'm not the enemy
Girl
I just wanna be the only one
Who can make you happy
Baby come close
I want to feel your body
Take it slow
Ain't gotta follow nobody
We can't go wrong
Baby just think about it

Sure baby we could be friends
(Slow dance, romance, back rubs
Hiked up, slowly
That's us rolling in the meadow
When we do it all)
(Slow dance, romance, back rubs
Hiked up, slowly

Just you and me s
O why just be friends)
And all you gotta do is take it off

Now I know that love has failed
You many times before
But I'm trying to make you see
That the only one is me
So forget the other guys
You dated long ago
And just let your mind be free
Let's be more then just friends

(Slow dance, romance, back rubs
Hiked up, slowly
That's us rolling in the meadow
When we do it all)
