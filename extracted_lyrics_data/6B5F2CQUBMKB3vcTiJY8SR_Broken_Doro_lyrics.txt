3 ContributorsBroken LyricsSomebody please say a prayer for me tonight
I'm feelin' lost and there's no hope in sight
Tryin' to hold on to the vision
So hard when you're down
I'd trade an ounce of hard earned wisdom just to get out
CHORUS
You'll never know, till you've been broken
With the weight of the world in your hands
Don't want to know
Heart full of sorrow
Nobody loves you when you're broken
Broken down
No money, no place to lay my head down
Nobody to drive away the tears..
And if I get my hunger again oh yeah
And if I get that feelin' again
It's all the same
CHORUS
You'll never know, till you've been broken
With the weight of the world in your hands
Don't want to know
Heart full of sorrow
Nobody loves you when you've spoken
The last kind words you know
And I don't wanna lie broken
On the groundYou might also likeEmbed
