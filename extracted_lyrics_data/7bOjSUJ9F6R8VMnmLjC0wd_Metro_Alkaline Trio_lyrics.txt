5 ContributorsMetro Lyrics
I'm alone
Sitting with my empty glass
My four walls
Follow me through my past
I was on a Paris train
I emerged in London rain
And you were waiting there
Swimming through apologies

I remember searching for the perfect words
I was hoping you might change your mind
I remember a soldier sleeping next to me
Riding on the metro

You wore white
Smiling as you took my hand
So removed
You spoke of wintertime in France
Minutes passed with shallow words
Years have passed and still I hurt
Oh, I can see it now
Smiling as I pulled away
You might also like
I remember a letter wrinkled in my hand
I love you always filled my eyes
I remember in the night we walked along the Seine
Riding on the metro


I remember a feeling coming over me
A soldier turned, then looked away
I remember hating you for loving me
Riding on the metro

I'm alone
Sitting with my broken glass
My four walls
Follow me through my past
I was on a Paris train
I emerged in London rain
And you were waiting there
Swimming through apologies
(Fucking asshole)

I remember searching for the perfect words
I was hoping you might change your mind
I remember a soldier sleeping next to me
Riding on the metro, wowEmbed
