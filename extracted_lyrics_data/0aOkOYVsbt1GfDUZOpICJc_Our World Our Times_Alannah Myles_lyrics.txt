4 ContributorsOur World, Our Times LyricsLittle tramp comin' up the strip
With a hundred dollar smile
Sparks flyin' off her fingertips
Drive the young cop wild
Some nights are wound so tight
Like a storm about to break
Better stand in your doorway
When everything starts to shake
You get restless
Like a cat waking up at midnight
Hungry, never quite satisfied
This is our world and these are our times
This is our world and these are our times
Little brother like a street god
With a drop dead attitude
Say, he's looking like a shadow now
Runnin' low on green and food
Some lives are wound up tight
Like a wave about to crash
Hard times seem to multiply
While the joy runs out so fast
You get restless
Like a kid crawling out of a bad dream
Hungry, never quite satisfied

This is our world and these are our times
This is our world and these are our times
This is our world and these are our times
Make way for the son of a rebel
Wired to a bottle of flame
He's got two black eyes and a purple heart
And a bone hangin' on a chain
These times are like dynamite
A head-on with history
Some fool's bound to burn it all down
Don't care about you and me
He'll get desperate
Like a child in the eye of a nightmare
Hungry, never quite satisfied
This is our world and these are our times
This is our world and these are our times
This is our world and these are our times
This is our world and these are our timesEmbed
