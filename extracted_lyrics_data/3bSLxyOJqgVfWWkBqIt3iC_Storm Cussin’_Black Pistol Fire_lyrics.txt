3 ContributorsStorm Cussinâ€™ LyricsThrow me down a line
I've been sinkin' with the risin' tide
Away my brittle bones
To the side of a rollin' stone
Caught me in a lie
Don't know if its wrong or if its right, bye
Help is on the way
Don't know if I can be saved
Old enough to know
Forever might be too long
Don't talk me down
No use for me givin' one more try, try
Good for nothin', but you got me all
Storm cussin', cussin'
Good for nothin', but you got me all
Storm cussin', cussin'
Hard times, time will show ya the door
Yours are not to keep
Spend my last days pullin' teeth
Knowing what you told
You're worth your weight in gold
Lay me down to die
In the hour of the wolf I heard you cry, cry
You might also likeGood for nothin', but you got me all
Storm cussin', cussin'
Good for nothin', but you got me all
Storm cussin', cussin'
Hard times, time will show ya the door
Hard times, what you waitin' for
Hard times, time  settle the score
Hard times, time to show you the doorEmbed
