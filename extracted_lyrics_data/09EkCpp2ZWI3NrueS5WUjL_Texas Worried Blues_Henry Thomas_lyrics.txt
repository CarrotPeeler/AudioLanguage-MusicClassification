I've got the worried blues, Lord I'm feeling bad
I've got the worried blues, Lord I'm feeling bad
I've got the worried blues, Lord I'm feeling bad

I've got no one tell my troubles to
I've got no one tell my troubles to
I've got no one tell my troubles to

You can box me up and send me to my ma
You can box me up and send me to my ma
You can box me up and send me to my ma

If my ma don't want me, send me to my pa
If my ma don't want me, send me to my pa
If my ma don't want me, send me to my pa

If my pa don't want me, send me to my girl
If my pa don't want me, send me to my girl
If my pa don't want me, send me to my girl

If my girl don't want me, cast me in the sea
If my girl don't want me, cast me in the sea
If my girl don't want me, cast me in the sea

I'm going to build me a heaven of my own
I'm going to build me a heaven of my own
I'm going to build me a heaven of my own

I'm going to give all good‑time women a home
I'm going to give all good‑time women a home
I'm going to give all good‑time women a home

Get your hat and your coat, get shaking it all down the line
Get your hat and your coat, get shaking it all down the line
Get your hat and your coat, get shaking it all down the line

Now fare thee my honey, fare thee
Now fare thee my honey, fare thee
Now fare thee my honey, fare theeEmbed
