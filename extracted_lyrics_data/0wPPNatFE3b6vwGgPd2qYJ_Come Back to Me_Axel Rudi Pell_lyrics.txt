2 ContributorsCome Back To Me Lyrics(Verse 1)
He was born with a six - string
Not a shotgun in his hand
And he walked across the water
To reach the promised land
And he searched for the future
For the meaning of our lives
Hearing echo in the distance
Telling love's so hard to find
(Pre-Chorus)
Catch the storm
Don't wait until the dawn
Catch the storm
No way to run, no way to run
(Chorus)
Come back to me
I need your love so bad
Come back to me
Without you I feel so sad
(Verse 2)
There were endless days and nights
Where our love turned into ice
But the flame's inside still burnin'
Broken dreams in paradise
You might also likeWe called the eyes of the rainbow
To free us from our sins
We searched the night for all lost promises
A fight we couldn't win
(Pre-Chorus)
Catch the storm
Don't wait until the dawn
Catch the storm
There is no more to roam, no way to run
(Chorus x2)
Come back to me
I need your love so bad
Come back to me
Without you I feel so sad
Come back to me
I need your love so bad
Come back to me
Without you I feel so sad
So sad
(Guitar Solo)
Oh yeah!
(Chorus x2 + Tale)
Come back to me
I need your love so bad
Come back to me
Without you I feel so sad
Come back to me (Yeah!)
I need your love so bad
Come back to me
Without you I feel so sad
So sad
Oh yeah
So come back to me (Yeah!)
Without you I feel so sad
So sad..
So sad..
Ah..
So sad..Embed
