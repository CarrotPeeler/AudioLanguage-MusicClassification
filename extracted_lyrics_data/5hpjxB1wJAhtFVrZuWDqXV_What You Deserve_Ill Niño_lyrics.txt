4 ContributorsWhat You Deserve Lyrics
It's too bad that you have made mistakes
Too bad that I cannot relate
When all else fails, when all else fades
I kept my way through bitter days (Through bitter days)

What you don't know (Don't know)
Won't leave a scar
What you don't know (Don't know)
Hasn't killed you so far
What you don't know (Don't know)
Is who you are
I just give you something to talk about
What you don't know

It's too late that now, I changed my mind
Too late somehow to recognize
When all else fails, and all I find
Are all my words perdido in time? (Just lost in time)

What you don't know (Don't know)
Won't leave a scar
What you don't know (Don't know)
Hasn't killed you so far
What you don't know (Don't know)
Is who you are
I just give you something to talk about
You might also like
So you lost yourself, turned to someone else
And you've given up your will to want to know
Then you find yourself and you're someone else
In the end you only get what you deserve (What you deserve)

What you don't know (Don't know)
Won't leave a scar
What you don't know (Don't know)
Hasn't killed you so far
What you don't know (Don't know)
Is who you are
I just give you something to talk about

What you don't know (Don't know)
What you don't know (Don't know)
What you don't know (Don't know)Embed
