1 ContributorNatural Reaction LyricsThe photographs don't lie
We can't be alone, we can't be
Dangerous and sublime
Don't try this at home, don't try this
We used to be invisible
Unlike you I like movin', I like movin'
Used to be invincible
Before you I liked movin', I liked movin'
I get so nervous
Waitin' for a natural reaction
And I can't stop thinkin', you'll explode
Leave me a nervous wreck, nervous wreck
The longest afterglow
Ya it keeps me afloat, ya it keeps me
New York city I know
Don't pick up the phone, don't pick up
We need to be invincible
Unlike you I like movin', I like movin'
Used to be invincible
Before you I liked movin', I liked movin'
I get so nervous
Waitin' for a natural reaction
And I can't stop thinkin', you'll explode
Leave me a nervous wreck
You might also likeI can't stop thinkin'
I can't stop thinkin'
(I can't stop thinkin')
I can't stop thinkin'
(I can't stop thinkin')
We need to be invincible
Unlike you I like movin', I like movin'
Used to be invincible
Before you I liked movin', I liked movin'
I get so nervous
Waitin' for a natural reaction
And I can't stop thinkin', you'll explode
Leave me a nervous wreckEmbed
