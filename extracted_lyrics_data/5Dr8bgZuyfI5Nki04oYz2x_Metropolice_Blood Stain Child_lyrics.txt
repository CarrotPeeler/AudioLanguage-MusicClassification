We can see the falling fighting
I can see, you can see
We can see the falling fighting
Fall
In this developing metropolice
Fall
Cyber that all digitalized
We forget having stepped
On the Earth with the shank's mare
We soak in the paradise of the delight
Politics and economy are all genetive structure
I can see the falling fighting
You can see the falling fighting
We can see the falling fighting
In the...
Fall
Imagine it, what do you wish in that?
Fall
We are not a machine and iron
We have an ego and the will
In the world where everything is made
Automation our existence
Also will disappear for long

Say, fly, stay, we are denied to what oneself
I can see, you can see
We can see the falling fighting
I can see, you can see
Fall
Say, fly, stay, soul
Say, fly, stay, we are denied to what oneself
I can see, you can see
We can see the falling fighting
I can see, you can see
We can see the falling fightingEmbed
