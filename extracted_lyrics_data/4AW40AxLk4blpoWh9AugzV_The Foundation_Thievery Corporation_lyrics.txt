We are all ready to win
Just as we are born
Knowing what is life
Telling the world of the truth and the rights
That exist in this Earth

That exist in this Earth

With the proud civilizations that created them
Sparta, Rome, the Knights of Europe, the Samurai
They worship strength because it is strength
That makes all other valuables possible
Here is the foundation of creation
Here is the foundation of creation
Here is the foundation of creation
Here is the foundation of creation

Roaring element from creation to this side of the Ganesha
