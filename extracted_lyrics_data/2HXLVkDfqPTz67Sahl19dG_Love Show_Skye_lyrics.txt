4 ContributorsLove Show Lyrics
Sit down, give me your hand
I'm gonna tell you the future
I see you, living happily
With somebody who really suits you
Someone like me

Stand still, breathe in
Are you listening?

You don't know, somebody is aching
Keeping it all in, somebody won't let go
Of his heart but the truth is
It's painless letting your love show (Love show)

Break down, give me some time
I don't want the fear to confuse you
Right now, it's so wrong
But maybe it's all in the future
With someone like you

Stand still, breathe in
Are you listening?
You might also like
You don't know, somebody is aching
Keeping it all in, somebody won't let go
Of his heart but the truth is
It's painless letting your love show
(Letting your love show)

Maybe truth, maybe lies
Made me want you
Maybe dumb, maybe wise
I don't know

Somebody is aching
Keeping it all in, somebody won't let go
Of his heart but the truth is
It's painless letting your love show
You don't know, somebody's hurting
Holding it all in, somebody can't let go
Of his heart but the truth is
It's painless letting your love show

Letting your love show (Love show)
Love show
Oh (Love show)
(Letting your love show)Embed
