Spending time nowadays
Nowadays it’s nice
It’s paradise
Equal time
Equal spending
Yes it’s nice
It’s paradise

Nowadays you cook eggs
Equal breakfast
And again
In bed it’s nice

You’re equal but different
You’re equal but different
You’re equal but different
You’re equal but different
You’re equal but different
You’re equal but different
You’re equal but different
You’re equal but different
It’s obvious (it's obvious)
It’s obvious (it's obvious)
It’s obvious (it's obvious)
So obvious (so obvious)
You might also like
Spending time nowadays
By myself
That’s oh so nice
And again with you
It’s equal nice
Is it paradise?

Nowadays I wash sheets
Send a buck
Scrub my back for me
That’s paradise

You’re equal but different
You’re equal but different
You’re equal but different
You’re equal but different
You’re equal but different
You’re equal but different
You’re equal but different
You’re equal but different
It’s obvious (it's obvious)
It’s obvious (it's obvious)
It’s obvious (it's obvious)
So obvious (so obvious)
Spending time nowadays
By myself
That’s oh so nice
And again with you
It’s equal nice
It’s paradise

Nowadays you wash sheets
Send a buck
To scrub my back for me
That’s paradise

You’re equal
But different
You’re equal
But different
You’re equal but different
You’re equal but different
You’re equal but different
You’re equal but different
You’re equal but different
You’re equal but different
You’re equal but different
You’re equal but different
It’s obvious (it's obvious)
It’s obvious (it's obvious)
It’s obvious (it's obvious)
So obvious (so obvious)
It’s obvious (it's obvious)
So obvious (so obvious)
It’s obvious (it's obvious)
So obvious (so obvious)
