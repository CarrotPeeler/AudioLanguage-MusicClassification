2 ContributorsFox and the Hound Lyrics
Swing low like a gold-plated crucifix
Holy heart hang Christ on a Cuban link
Do it my way, do it my way
Blood in my veins
The Messiah is alive you can hear Her in my—
Swing low like a gold-plated crucifix
Holy heart hang Christ on a Cuban link
Do it my way, do it my way
Blood in my veins
The Messiah is alive you can hear Her in my—

I've been carving at this marble stone
Like Michelangelo
Since I was ten years old
And I was almost at the end of my wits
When I saw my truth unfold
I was twenty-five years old
Had that quarter century glow

Safe and sound
Fox and the hound
What you gonna say to me now?
Ace with the crown
Eyes straight, straight to the ground
’Cause I missed my life aiming straight for the crown
You might also like
The higher the climb is the greater the fall
The stiffer the drink is the deeper you sleep
And the more you put in is the more you withdraw
And the more things blur is the clearer I dream
Rely on me like the words of a Saint
And nothing kills quicker than the burden of hate
The circle of time is the curve of your faith
It's pretty abstract but I fuck with the shape
Loch Ness monster, horns and a cape
Flames of fury and the Devils' face
And once you’ve conquered all that credulous rage
The world ends 'cause you were four minutes late, goin'

Safe and sound
Fox and the hound
What you gonna say to me now?
Ace with the crown
Eyes straight, straight to the ground
'Cause I missed my life aiming straight for the crown
I was in a hurry, skipped the journey
Let life slip by aiming straight for the crown
I was in a hurry, skipped the journey
Let life slip by—
Swing low like a gold-plated crucifix
Holy heart hang Christ on a Cuban link
Do it my way, do it my way
Blood in my veins
The Messiah is alive you can hear Her in my
Swing low like a gold-plated crucifix
Holy heart hang Christ on a Cuban link
Do it my way, do it my way
Blood in my veins
The Messiah is alive you can hear Her in my

Shoulda left a long time ago
It's like five below
This city's fuckin' brick-ass cold
And I was almost at the end of my wits
When I saw my truth unfold
I was twenty-five years old
Had that quarter century glow

Safe and sound
Fox and the hound
What you gonna say to me now?
Ace with the crown
Eyes straight, straight to the ground
'Cause I missed my life aiming straight for the crown
Got lost in the web of the nexus
Aligns and connects us
Mind, body, and a Lexus
Pray for a little more excess (Flex this)
Rhyme with a little hidden message (Restless)
Mind the begs for a message (Message)
I’m not a Saint nor a hero (Bet this)
I’m just a man with a passion vested
I'm just a man with a drink and a set-list
I’m just a man like Ziggy Stardust
I'm just a man that got lost in a sentence
I'm just a man that's trying his hardest
I’m not a man with a grandiose message

Safe and sound
Fox and the hound
What you gonna say to me now?
Ace with the crown
Eyes straight, straight to the ground
'Cause I missed my life aiming straight for the crown
I was in a hurry, skipped the journey
Let life slip by aiming straight for the crown
I was in a hurry, skipped the journey
Let life slip by—

Do it my way, do it my way
Blood in my veins
The Messiah is alive you can hear Her in my—

Swing low like a gold-plated crucifix
Holy heart hang Christ on a Cuban link

Blood in my veins
