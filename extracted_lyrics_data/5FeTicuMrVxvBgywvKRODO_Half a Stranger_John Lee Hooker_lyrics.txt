I just got in your town
I'm a stranger babe
I just got in your town
Don't drive me from your door, baby
'Cause I done no, nobody wrong
It's cold outside babe
I don't have no place to go
It's cold outside babe
I have no place to go
Take me in, take me in, baby
Let me stay all night with you
I'm a stranger baby
And I just got of the train
I'm a stranger baby
I just got of the train
I don't know no nobody in this town baby
Honey child please take me in
Little rain keep falling baby
And my clothes getting mighty wetYou might also likeEmbed
