4 ContributorsParanoid Lyrics
Finished with my woman, 'cause she couldn't help me
With my mind
People think I'm insane because I am frownin'
All the time
All day long, I think of things, but nothin' seems
To satisfy
Think I'll lose my mind if I don't find something
To pacify

Can you help me
Occupy my brain?
Oh, yeah!

I need someone to show me the things in life
That I can't find
I can't see the things that make true happiness
I must be blind


Make a joke an' I will sigh an' you will laugh
An' I will cry
Happiness, I cannot feel an' love, to me
Is so unreal
An' so, as you hear these words tellin' you now
Of my state
I tell you to enjoy life, I wish I could
But it's too lateSee Metallica LiveGet tickets as low as $60You might also likeEmbed
