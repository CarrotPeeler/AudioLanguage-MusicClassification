35 ContributorsArmy of One Lyrics

Been around the world, wonders to view
Been around the world looking for someone like you
Pyramids try, Babylon too
But the beautifulest treasures lie in the deepest blue

So I never say die, aim never untrue
I'm never so high as when I'm with you
And there isn't a fire that I wouldn't walk through
My army of one is gonna fight for you

Been around the world, universe too
I've been around flying, baby, there's nothin' I wouldn't do
Tanzaku stars, lasso the moon
And be standing there beside you right when the storm comes through

'Cause I never say die, aim never untrue
I'm never so high as when I'm with you
And there isn't a fire that I wouldn't walk through
My army of one is gonna fight for you
My army of one is gonna fall for you, yeah

'Cause you reign
'Cause you reign
'Cause you reign
My army of one is gonna call it through

Sayin' my heart is my gun, army of one
Yeah, my heart is my gun, army of one
It's my only weapon, army of one
Sayin' my heart is my gun, army of one


(So I race for it)

Staring at darkness, staring at doom
My heart, b-boom, b-boom, boom
Staring at darkness, admit defeat
Come along when I'm finding no peace

And I know and I know and I know
I know I'm unlocked
And I know and I know and I know
I know what you've got
So I put my hands up to the sky, feel alive
Got a rocket ship that I wanna ride
Put my hands up to the sky, it's alright
Wherever you are, I'll find that treasure

So I race for it
Wherever you are, I'll find that treasure
So I race for it

Staring at darkness, staring at doom
You make my heart b-boom, b-boom, boom
Superhero, masterpiece
Been in a city, but it centered around me

And I know and I know and I know
I know I'm in love (I know I'm in love)
And I know and I know and I know
I know when I'm locked

I just put my hands up to the sky, feel alive
Got a rocket ship that I wanna ride
Put my hands up to the sky, feel it inside
Wherever you are, I'll find that treasure
I put my hands up to the sky, feelin' alright
I gotta lock it, eyes on the prize
Put my hands up to the sky, I'm gonna fight
Wherever you are, I'll find that treasure
So I race for it
Wherever you are, I'll find that treasure
So I race for it (Yeah, yeah)
Wherever you are, I'll find that treasure
So I race for it
And I know and I know and I know
I know what I've got (So I race for it)
"X" marks the spot

So I put my hands up to the sky, feel alive
Got a rocket ship that I wanna ride
Put my hands up to the sky, feel it inside
Wherever you are, I'll find that treasure
I put my hands up to the sky, feelin' alright (Yeah, yeah)
I gotta lock it, eyes on the prize
Put my hands up to the sky, I'm gonna fight
Wherever you are, I'll find that treasure

Yeah, yeah
Wherever you are, I'll find that treasure15Embed
