I just spent three hours in the pool
You know three hours in the pool
You know three hours in the pool
And I became part the water, part the air, part of all the color in the air, part of space
You know, it was me and I was it
It all melted in together, that’s why I stayed there so long
I didn’t know what to do..See Diplo LiveGet tickets as low as $63You might also likeEmbed
