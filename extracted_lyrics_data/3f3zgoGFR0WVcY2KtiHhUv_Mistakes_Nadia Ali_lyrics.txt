4 ContributorsMistakes LyricsYou can't imagine what I felt
Those days everything fixed itself
Worries that didn't have want to sail
Leave me I know I was no angel
Coz I learned the hard way
Made of mistake after mistake
You can't imagine my surprise
To hear that you moved on and deserve a new life
Where was I when all of this took place ?
Please don't say that it's too late
Guess you learn the hard way
Keep on making mistakes after mistakes
You were supposed to be
You were suppositely to be the only one that knew me
I was supposed to be
Wasn't I suppositely the one you loved truly
But I learned the hard way
Made those mistakes after mistakes
So I learned the hard way
Won't make those mistakes again
