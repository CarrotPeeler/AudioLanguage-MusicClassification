The year was 1933, we stood there, you and me
As the smoke cleared from the train
There were puddles in the street, we strolled to boîte de nuit
To watch the cabaret
Oh petticoats and boots and blush, there's life in lights so grand and lush
Now fading into dreams
And on the stage Kastner and Fink still sing your tributes as the diva
Of the silver screen, oh, what a dream

The night we met you sang into my heart, my Cleopatra from the start
Donning lashes and a cane
For yards men buskers and bourgeoise, you table danced a coup d'état
While sipping pink champagne
The air grew cold and whispers told of wolves lurking beneath the fold
We knew we couldn't stay
There were flowers in your hair, I grabbed one, tossed one in the air
You sang like Lady Day, what did you say?

Farewell, kabarista, your requiem's been played
You reached up to the moon, poured stars onto the stage
Farewell, kabarista, the writing's on the wall
Der Letzte beißen die Hunde, it's your final curtain call
Kabarista, farewell
Kabarista, farewell
You might also like
You grabbed me by the hand and danced among the band
Painted pictures on the wall
Soon the sky was filled of light, Hell came in with the night
We'd soon watch Europe fall
With all the madness of a dream, we pulled the curtain on the scene
And fled for brighter days
America, you called our name, and so we sailed into the rain
Onto our last brigade

A week across a stormy sea, hello, Lady Liberty
Your promises are grand
Two loves from out across the swill, we've come to ring our bells
Plant seeds within your sands
One day again, the sun will rise when fascist walls meet their demise
And topple into spring
And you and I shall raise our flags in memory of those who died in drag
And for who we sing

Farewell, kabarista, your requiem's been played
You reached up to the moon, poured stars onto the stage
Farewell, kabarista, the writing's on the wall
Der Letzte beißen die Hunde, it's your final curtain call
Kabarista, farewell
Kabarista, farewell
Kabarista, farewell
Kabarista, farewellEmbed
