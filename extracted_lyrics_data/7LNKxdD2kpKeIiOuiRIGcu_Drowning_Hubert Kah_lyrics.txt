1 ContributorDrowning LyricsWe're lost forever in the arctic snow
And now we can't turn back
Our bodies frozen and the compass gone
But I don't feel a thing
Touching lips on your warm, soft breast
And jasmine tea in June
And a fingertip inside your thigh
Now I need them so much
Under water
And they say dead fish can't swim home
With no direction in a trap of ice
My hands are getting numb
And Mr. Frost has taken one last bite
It doesn't worry me
Take me down to the garden shed
To feel your warm embrace
And I'll be with you when the night comes down
No, I can't forget
Under water
