2 ContributorsHow You Want It Done? LyricsWhy don't you tell me, lovin' mama, how you want you're rollin' done?
Why don't you tell me, lovin' mama, how you want you're rollin' done?
Lord, I give you satisfaction, now, if it's all night long
Lord, I got up this morning just about the break of day
Lord, I got up this morning just about the break of day
Lord, I'm thinkin' 'bout my baby, Lord, the one that went away
I got me a little brownskin, just as sweet as she can be
I got me a little brownskin, just as sweet as she can be
Lord, she low and she squatty, but she's alright with me
Now you can put me in the alley, my gal's name is Sally
You wake me up in the mornin', mama, I still got that old habit
Why don't you tell me, how you want it done
Now, I give you satisfaction, now if it's all night long
Lord, some of these old mornings, mama, Lord, it won't be long
Lord, some of these old mornings, mama, Lord, it won't be long
Lord, I know you gonna call me, mama, Lord, and I'll be thereYou might also likeEmbed
