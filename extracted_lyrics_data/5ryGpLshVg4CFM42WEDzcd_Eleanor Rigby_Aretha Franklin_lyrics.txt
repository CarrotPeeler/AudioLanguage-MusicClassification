6 ContributorsEleanor Rigby Lyrics
I'm Eleanor Rigby
I picked up the rice in the church where the weddings have been, yeah
I'm Eleanor Rigby
I'm keeping my face in a jar by the door
If you want to know what is it for, Well

All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?

Father McKenzie
Writing the words to a sermon
That no one will hear
No one comes near
Look at him working
Knotting his socks in the night
What does he care, yeah

All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?
Yeah

Eleanor Rigby died in the church
And was buried along with her name
Nobody came
Father McKenzie Wiping the dirt from his hands
As he walks from the grave

All of the lonely people
Where do, where do they come from?
All over the world, the lonely, lonely, lonely people
Where do, where do they all belong?

The lonely (Eleanor)
Only the lonely know (Eleanor Rigby)
Woo hoo, the lonely (Eleanor)
Only the lonely people know (Eleanor Rigby)
Just like Eleanor Rigby
Eleanor Rigby
Only the lonely
Yeah, the lonely, yeah1Embed
