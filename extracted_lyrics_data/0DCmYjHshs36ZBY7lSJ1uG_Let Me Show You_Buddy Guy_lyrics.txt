Each and every day
I would not havin'
Any other way
My mother she taught me
How to show you my love
Because my way's in action
Speak much louder than words
Put your arms around my waist
And look direct in my face
And I'll show you I love you
And no one else can take your place
Let me show you I love you
Each and every day
Because I would not never havin'
Any other way
Put your arms around my waist
And look me direct in my face
And I'll show you I love you
And no one else can take your placeYou might also likeEmbed
