2 ContributorsRising High Water Blues Lyrics
Backwater risin', Southern people can't make no time
I said backwater rising, Southern people can't make no time
And I can't get no hearing from that Memphis girl of mine

Water in Arkansas, people screamin' in Tennessee
Oh, people screamin' in Tennessee
If I don't leave Memphis, backwater spill all over poor me

Paper states its raining, it has been for nights and days
Paper states its raining, has been for nights and days
Thousand people stands on the hill, lookin' down where they used to stay

Children sadly pleading, "Mama, we ain't got no home
Oh, mama we ain't got no home"
Papa says to children, "Backwater left us all alone"

Backwater risin', come in my windows and door
That backwater risin', come in my windows and door
I leave with a prayer in my heart, backwater won't rise no moreYou might also like1Embed
