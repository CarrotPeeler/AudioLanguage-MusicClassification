1 ContributorAnimal Skin LyricsI see in you an animal trace
That's quick in your blond and deep in your face
Mine has been tamed; I'm shamed to pretend
When I'm this close to your animal skin
I remember when love was something I craved
Bot I settled for less and the comfort it gave
For living is hard when real love begins
And it leaves heavy lines on your animal skin
Oh, let your arms make a deep night for me
Enclosing my world so I cannot see
L'll rise with your breath and fall back again
â€˜Cause you bring me close to my animal skin
You bring me back to where I'd once been
When I'm this close to your animal skinYou might also likeEmbed
