2 ContributorsSecrets LyricsEvening would see me alone at the TV
When footsteps are heard
A face at the window
A voice out of nowhere
A whispered word
Curtains moving
Door handle turning
The next room is empty, but there’s someone jumping up and down
(Secrets)
I thought they were my best friends
(Secrets)
I’m so glad every bad dream ends
(Secrets)
I thought they would protect me from the devil, but they’re part of his plan
(Secrets)
To kill my emotion, it’s the isolation age of the solitary man
When the clock is controller, no way to unwind
(Look over your shoulder)
A photo may haunt you with a ghost of a smile
Inside me was someone writing a book, telling me what to feel
Selling my pain to the people that came through, I would conceal
My real sensations
(Sensations)
Give them quotations
(Quotations)
Pin them down on a page, crucify butterflies

I thought they were my best friends
(Secrets)
I’m so glad every bad dream ends
(Secrets)
Party hat people were laughing all around, but I yawned like a grave
(Secrets)
I said they were hollow, I sucked on my sorrow and crept back to my cave
A fossil remains of my image in rain
And the walls in my room, they fade as we change
But we leave them behind, we leave them behind
As I am with you
And then there were two
Then you kicked the door down
You broke all my windows
Light climbing through
The future was loaded
Your brain bomb exploded
And then there were two
No more secrets, the windows are turning
No more secrets, the curtains are burning with
(Secrets)
The photo faded, sensations exploded, they’re laughing all around
(Secrets)
I know now it was you in the room that'd been jumping up and down
(Secrets)
The skeleton bones said leave me alone, but you blew off the dust
(Secrets)
You took in the things I'd left for years out in the rain
(Secrets)
And you wiped off the rust, you wiped off the rust
Party hat friends make the clock unwind
Empty my brain, leave the future behind
You blew off the darkness
Protect me from the book inside
I believe electrify, crucify
I know now
I know nowEmbed
