2 ContributorsPlastic Hips LyricsThe doctor is comin` cause the world´s lookin` ill
So sick I have to amputate you will
Let me work with my tools for a minute
I stimulate your feelings, like sex so organic/aesthetic
Is your life real, what is really real now 
Everything breaks down
Let me inplant a new sound..
Spread medicine watch this epidemic
While you look phlegmatic I will destroy all the static
Look at your hips bones turn to plastic
I ´m prepared, work hard now you look fantastic
HA – I need a knife, a drill and a saw
For those who don´t like my treatment I got injections in a car
This is a surgery , Next one please...
I try to make our life better
But first I clean the streets
I´m bringin` chaos and destruction
Today I interrupt you, cut you and
Then I f++k you
Dressed in white, cogitations black
The meat wagon is packed
I hit the ground like that, say...
Drastic symptomatic plastic
Elastic systematic plastic
Show me what you got
Show me what you got
I take what you got
I take what you got
I´m comin` around the block peepin` all this beautiful
Girls wonderful women with blond curls
Incredible view but I must change something
Cause their hips are not stunning
But when they see my face they´re running
I will kill the defective, like a detective
Cut flesh like it´s breakfast
Cause the fact is, that everybody looks the same
But with these colorful plastic hips
I will change the game
Try to wear it, yeah you`re lookin` good
The clubs are packed with new thing from the hood
Dance, shake, shake, show me what you got
Do you like it or not - "No" – shut the f++k up!
I bring transition like the 4 apocalyptical horsemen
Burning churches 10 in the morning
The doctor creeps around the corner
My trunk full of platic torture - I warned ya
So better watch your hips, move quick I repair you
Cause you sick, say...
Drastic symptomatic plastic
Elastic systematic plastic
Show me what you got
Show me what you got
I take what you got
Cause my sh+t is hotYou might also likeEmbed
