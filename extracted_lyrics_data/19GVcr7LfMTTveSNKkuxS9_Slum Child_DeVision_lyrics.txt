1 ContributorSlum Child LyricsYour painful eyes
Tell the story of your life
About everything you need
About something you forget
The silence never heard
The pleasure never felt
And the tears they're falling down
And the fear it comes again
You're behind the times
You believe in God alone
I know his little ways
Don't listen to the voice
Let him alone
And the slum child looks around
Tries to escape and goes...
And the slum child looks around
Tries to escape and goes
To the place he needs
And don't forget the words I said to you
And you tears are falling down
Tries to escape
And the fear it comes again
Tries to escape and goes
To the place he needs
And don't ever forget the words I said to you
I said to you
You might also likeAnd your tears are falling down
Tries to escape and goes...
And the fear it comes again
Tries to escape and goes...Embed
