Oh, they put you in the dead room
I can't get away too soon
They put me in the dead room
I know they've got pedigrees
They're telling you they've got "One of these"
Please, please, let me out of this dead room
Book it out about seven days
Oh, you're working in a dead room
All this talk about standing ways
Working in a dead room
Plate's full
Your rate's cool
I don't wanna seem ungrateful, but they
Well, they put me in a dead room
Not sure if I'm above or below
Or somewhere lateral
But they put me in the dead room
Well, they put me in the dead room
Dead room
Dead room
Dead room
