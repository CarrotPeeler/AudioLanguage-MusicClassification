3 ContributorsDestroy the Flower LyricsShe loved beautiful things
They made her smile and sing
Put your whistle in your pocket
And it stayed there
He was clever boy
Full of new ideas
Who told you could do that?
So he didn't
Destroy the flower
Destroy the flower
An unusual child
Well on her way
Somebody stopped her
Maybe they were scared
It'll never come out now
And it's all your fault
Give yourself a break
But she couldn't
Destroy the flower
Destroy the flower
Destroy the flower
In the warm spring
Still the flowers bloom
Still the beautiful things can surround us
He was clever enough
To stay drugged fucked up
You could have gone somewhere
But you didn't
It'll never come out now
And it's all your fault
This goes on and on and on and on because you didn't change it
You destroy the flower
You destroy the flower
You destroy the flower
