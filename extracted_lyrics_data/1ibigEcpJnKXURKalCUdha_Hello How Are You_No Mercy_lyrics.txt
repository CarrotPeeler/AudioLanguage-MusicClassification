Would be good to see you again
Hello, where are you?
I've been trying to reach you in vain
The emotion's written cross my face
Like no rain drops in a sunny place
All the people that you knew before
Don't seem satisfied any more
I just contemplate the days we had
Now the sorrow here and I feel so sad
All this burning pain so hard to contain
All my memories on the nowhere train
Hello, how are you?
Would be good to see you again
Hello, where are you?
I've been trying to reach you in vain
Since you left I began to feel so sad
And my heart's been shaking with fear
I remember now the times we've had
And I think I wish you were here
And I think I wish you were here
Hello how are you?
My imagination's driving me wild
And I'm feeling like a silly child
I keep hoping and I search the sky
All I have now are the tears I cry
I just contemplate the days we had
Now the sorrows here and I feel so sad
All this burning pain so hard to contain
All my memories on the nowhere train
Hello, how are you?
Would be good to see you again
Hello, where are you?
I've been trying to reach you in vain
I remember now the times we've had
And I think I wish you were here
And I think I wish you were here
Hello, how are you?
Hello, how are you?
It's good to see you again
Hello, where are you?
I've been trying to reach you in vain
Hello, how are you?
It's good to see you again
Hello, where are you?
I've been trying to reach you in vain
Hello, how are you?
And I think I wish you were here
