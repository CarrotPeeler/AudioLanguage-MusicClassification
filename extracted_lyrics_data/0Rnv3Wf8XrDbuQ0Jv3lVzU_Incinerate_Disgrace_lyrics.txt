9 ContributorsTyrannical Lyrics
Look at me now, I'm a god
Came out the cut with your head on a platter
Everything that I say is super odd
Why do you bother me with all the chatter?
You do not matter, go die in a forest
I just had enough of you fuckers, ain't notice?
I am too troubled like doubled insanity
I am Le Menace, sick fucker from down the street
Violent energy creeping inside of me
Forget everything that you heard from me
I reap what I sow, you don't even know how the hell I get busy
Don't go to my show
If I was in power, I'm stealing your rights
Land of the lost, in the dead of the night
"Why so much anger?" Don't even complain
'Cause this a result of just havin' my brain
Thinking of death every step of the way
Yes, I know, bitch, I'm okay
That's how I lie in your face
Such a disgrace to the family name
Used to be nice but you fuckers don't like it
So Ivan the Terrible's back into life
Got a knife in my hand
I understand, my nightmare is over, now let this begin
You might also like
Fuck everybody
Don't even communicate
Get your blood off my dinner plate
Let your body incinerate
Fuck everybody
Don't even communicate
Get your blood off my dinner plate
Let your body incinerate

All of you pussies afraid of expression
And no one will do it, I'm givin' you lessons
I'm cryin' my ass off 'cause life is a bitch
And she won't let me hit that, so I will get the bag

Fuck everybody
Don't even communicate
Get your blood off my dinner plate
Let your body incinerate
Fuck everybody
Don't even communicate
Get your blood off my dinner plate
Let your body incinerate
