(Goodbye, Mr. A, ooh)

There's a hole in your logic
You who know all the answers, oh-oh oh-oh
You claim science ain't magic
And expect me to buy it

Goodbye, Mr. A
You promised you would love us, but you knew too much
Goodbye, Mr. A
You had all the answers, but no human touch
If life is subtraction, your number is up
Your love is a fraction, it's not adding up

So busy showing me where I'm wrong
You forgot to switch your feelings on, oh-oh oh-oh
So, so superior, are you not?
You'd love a little bit, but you forgot

Goodbye, Mr. A (Goodbye, Mr. A)
You promised you would love us, but you knew too much (You knew too much)
Goodbye, Mr. A (Bye, Mr. A)
You had all the answers, but no human touch (No human touch)
If life is subtraction, your number is up
Your love is a fraction, it's not adding up
You might also like
(Goodbye, Mr. A)
(Goodbye, Mr. A)
Goodbye, Mr. A (Goodbye, Mr. A)
The world was full of wonder 'til you opened my eyes
Goodbye, Mr. A (Goodbye, Mr. A)
Wish you hadn't blown my mind and killed the surprise

Goodbye, Mr. A (Goodbye, Mr. A)
You promised you would love us, but you knew too much
Goodbye, Mr. A (Goodbye, Mr. A)
You had all the answers, but no human touch, ooh!
If life is subtraction, your number is up
Your love is a fraction, it's not adding up4Embed
