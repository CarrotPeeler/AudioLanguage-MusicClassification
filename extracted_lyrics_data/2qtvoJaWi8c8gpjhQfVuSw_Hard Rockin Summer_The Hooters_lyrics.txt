4 ContributorsHard Rockinâ€™ Summer LyricsIt was a night to remember, a fire down below
Couldn't hide from the heat there was nowhere to go
And the cat on the roof, she's running for cover
Deep in the jungle of a hard rockin summer
I was a young Romeo tryin' to find Juliet
I was hot on the trail of my own silhouette
And the cat on the roof, she's crazy from hunger
She waits in the shadows of a hard rockin summer
And then the sky started falling and night hit the ground
Thought I heard someone calling, the ghost of a sound
Now the cat on the roof has captured the hunter
Deep in the jungle of a hard rockin summer
It was a night to remember, you know what I mean
Now it's late in September and she's just a dream
And the cat on the roof, she's back under cover
And I'm just a prisoner of a hard rockin summerYou might also likeEmbed
