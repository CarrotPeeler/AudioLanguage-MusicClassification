I only have words to describe you
Describe you
I only have eyes to adore you
Adore you
(In my dream)

You are the one
To take in the day
Now you are gone
Shout out my love
To be the one

Just like you, you
Just like you, you

Turn up the bright one to glow
To glow
Waving to your soul
Hello, hello

Now you are gone
Shout out my love
To be the one
You might also like
Just like you, you
Just like you, you

Just like you, you
Just like you, you

Reasons I have to go
You, you

Just like you, you
Just like you, you

Just like you, you
Just like you, you1Embed
