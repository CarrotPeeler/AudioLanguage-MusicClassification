4 ContributorsCheatinâ€™ on You LyricsIt's the end to all my high jinx
It's the end to all my capers
Sort of a three way story
(the kind you read about in the sunday papers)
All I was gettin' over
Havin' both cakes and eatin' them too
But to my surprise
My slice on the sun
Been eatin' the forbidden fruit
Refrain
Oh I've been cheatin' on you
I've been cheatin' on you
Been cheatin' on you with
Somebody's been cheatin' on me
Strophe
Thought I was a Jimmy Slick
(Yeah, I thought that)
Don't I was a Charlie Cool
(Thought that too)

Turn the dooper into the doop
I'm so surprised
To find my slice on the sun
Been eatin' the forbidden fruit
Refrain
Oh, I've been cheatin' on you ...baby

Somebody's been cheatin' on me

How co-co-co-co-coo ooh dooped

Turn the dooper into the doop
