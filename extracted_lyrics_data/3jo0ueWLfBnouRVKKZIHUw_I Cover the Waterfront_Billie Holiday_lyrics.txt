I'm watching the sea
Will the one I love be coming back to me?
I cover the waterfront;
In search of my love
And I'm covered by a starlit sky above
Here am I patiently waiting, hoping and longing
Oh, how I yearn!
Where are you?
Have you forgotten?
Will you remember?
Will you return?
I cover the waterfront
I'm watching the sea
Will the one I love be coming back to me?
Here am I patiently waiting, hoping and longing
Oh, how I yearn!
Where are you?
Have you forgotten?
Will you remember?
Will you return?

I'm watching the sea
Will the one I love be coming back to me?
Will the one I love be coming back to me?Embed
