7 ContributorsA Modern Day City Symphony Lyrics(world gone crazy)

For hiphop I've got a warm heart that keeps my feet warm
But a cold head when it's code red in the streetzone
Stockholm

A modern day city symphony
The dying Mother Nature once sang this hymn for me
It's all vanity to try and uplift the crowd
Ain't no use, no one can stop them now
She quoted Bob Marley and I came to the conclusion
Total destruction is the only solution
Cause no matter what I say, it's too little too late
No way that I could ever set this crooked world straight
With wordplay, no other means either
You think those eyes make me wanna compete (huh)
We all losers in this Doctor Mabuse's society
With thousands surveillance cameras constantly eyin' me
They call it security, I call it conspiracy
To commit murder in the name of hypocrisy
We can't even see who's hid behind the mask of death
There's only one word left, keff
You might also like
And it stops, yes it quits
For hiphop I've got a warm heart that keeps my feet warm
But a cold head when it's code red in the streetzone
Stockholm, a modern day city symphony
The dying Mother Nature once sang this hymn for me
Don't take the shit I say too seriously
I'm really a comedian, laughing in the face of misery
The industry wants me to be living in apathy
So they can rule me more easily
But F that, I ain't with that, get the whiplash
Smile in your face but turn your ass and I'll kick back
Hold down the people too long
The people gon' strike back twice as strong
On some Vietnam, better yet Vietcong
Guerrilla warfare, fucking napalm bombs
I clench my palm and fist-fuck the system hard
Now you're scared, got security guards
That's what you get for keeping the people hungry
Don't you know that's bound to bounce back on you ass like bungy
A hungry mob is an angry mob
Like Bob said on Natty Dread, you afi dead
If you try us, David vs Goliath
Is the label that I'm on so go buy us
My shit is bias, deep underground left-field
Rapstyle tactile, something you can feel
From the barricades, never sipping Aliz√©
Suck blood out the downpresser, I'm sorry to say
Now you're the prey, your days are numbered
Looptroop, we're here to wake you out your slumber
Sorry, this ain't no wakeup-call, my mistake
Your bed's already burning, it's way to late
We celebrate by your deathbed
Wishing that a better society will resurrect
