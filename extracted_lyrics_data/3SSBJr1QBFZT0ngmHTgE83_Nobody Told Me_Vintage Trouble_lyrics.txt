So, get up and gather around, everyone
I’m withering. Dying. Trembling from trying. Barely crawling
What can be done?
What will be done?
NOBODY TOLD ME
NOBODY TOLD ME
NOBODY TOLD ME
HOW HEAVY THIS LIFE WAS GONNA BE
Here stands a silver lined believer. Not believing
A rosy-eyed dreamer awakening
Into a moment when hands are not given to the needing
What will become
Of this needing one?
NOBODY TOLD ME
NOBODY TOLD ME
NOBODY TOLD ME
HOW HEAVY THIS LIFE WAS GONNA BE
If I can just hold on
Until the morning dawns
And nothing remains but a better day
And my song…
Will sing of the weighed down times now behind me
And I’ll be moving
And I’ll be grooving

NOBODY TOLD ME
NOBODY TOLD ME
HOW HEAVY THIS LIFE WOULD BE
HOW HEAVY THIS LIFE WOULD BE
But I keep pushing on
Everyday’s getting heavier and heavier
Heavier and heavier
Everyday’s getting heavier and heavier
Heavier and heavierEmbed
