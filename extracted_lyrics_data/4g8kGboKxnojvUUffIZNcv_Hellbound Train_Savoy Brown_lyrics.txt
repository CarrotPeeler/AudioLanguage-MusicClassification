Hell-bound train, I'm on its track
Too late now to turn my back
Conductor coming, ticket in his hand
Come to claim my soul
Take me to his land

Hell-bound train, I been so wrong
Too late now, I'm moving on
Conductor standing, watch in his hand
Got to get aboard, take you to his land

I'm going down the road on the Hell-bound train
Take a long look, lady, 'cause
You won't see me again
Take a last look, lady
Yes, hard and long
'Cause I'm going down the road on the Hell-, the Hell-bound train

Hell-bound train driving slow
Move on down to the Hell below
Conductor, please, won't you lend a hand?
Got to get onboard, take me to your land
You might also like
Yes, I know I've been so wrong
Too late now, I'm moving on
Hell-bound train, I'm on its track
Moving down, I can't look back

I'm going down the road on the Hell-bound train
Take a last look, baby, 'cause
You won't see me again, lady
Take a long look, long
'Cause I'm going down the road on the Hell-, the Hell-bound train


I'm going down the road on the Hell-bound train
Take a last look, lady
You won't see me again
Take a last look, baby
Hard and long
'Cause I'm going down the road on the Hell-, Hell-, the Hell-bound train

Lost and flying down the road on the Hell-bound train
Lost and flying down the road on the Hell-bound train
Hand and hand with the devil
