3 ContributorsWhoa! Shut It Down LyricsI'm so sick of these fights, so sick of your mouth
I know where you live, and I see where you sleep
So let's settle this here and now
I'm not wasting away my life
Because you don't like
What I have to say
Sorry, I'm not just like you
Sorry
Who are you again? Remind me 'cause I don't care
I hope you like this, I really hope you do
I hope you like it as much as getting your face
Busted in with a hammer
You are done destroying lives
Everyone will suffer
I have given up on you
So who the fuck do you think you are?
You will learn to breathe through a straw
Who the fuck do you think you are?
Pick it up
So do the world a favor, pull your bottom lip
Over your face and swallow
I don't mean any disrespect (disrespect)
But I hope you are buried alive

Everyone will suffer
Your world is about to come crashing down
Everyone will sufferEmbed
