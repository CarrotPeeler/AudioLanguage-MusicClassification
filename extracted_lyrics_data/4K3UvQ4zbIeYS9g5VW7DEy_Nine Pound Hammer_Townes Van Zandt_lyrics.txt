2 ContributorsNine Pound Hammer Lyrics
Well this nine pound hammer, it's a little too heavy
For my size, honey, for my size
I'm goin' up on the mountain, gonna see my baby
I ain't comin' back, ah, I ain't comin' back

Well roll on buddy, don't you roll so slow
How can I roll when the wheels won't go?
Well roll on buddy, pull a load of coal
How can I pull when the wheels won't roll?


Well, it's a long way to Harlan, and it's a long way to Hazard
Just to get a little brew, just to get a little brew
Well, when I'm long gone you can make my tombstone
Outta number nine coal, outta number nine coal

Well roll on buddy, don't you roll so slow
How can I roll when the wheels won't go?
Well roll on buddy, pull a load of coal
How can I pull when the wheels won't roll?You might also likeEmbed
