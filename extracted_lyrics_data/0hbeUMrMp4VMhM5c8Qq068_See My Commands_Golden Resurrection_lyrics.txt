I look out to the world
So many mountains I have climbed
Will it end
Yeah, will it ever end
Will I ever reach the final goal

Hear me God
Help me now
Give me strength to carry on

See my commands
Follow them all
You're my creation
I care for you all
Seek in your heart
You'll find the way
See my commands
When I was young
Everything was black and white
I'm all confused
I'm running blind

Hear me God
Help me now
Give me strength to carry on
You might also like
See my commands
Follow them all
You're my creation
I care for you all
Seek in your heart
You'll find the way
See my commands

See my commands
Follow them all
You're my creation
I care for you all
Seek in your heart
You'll find the way
See my commandsEmbed
