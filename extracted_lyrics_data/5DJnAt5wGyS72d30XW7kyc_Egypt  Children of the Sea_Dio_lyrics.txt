7 ContributorsRed Sea Lyrics


Freedom!
It's carved in stone
They're marching on
Deliverance divinely conspired
Through desert nights
Once dead to rights
Now following a pillar of fire
It was written
So it shall be done
Generations of slavery
Seek the God that they know
Crush the heart of Pharaoh
Let my people go
At long last from Egypt released

Exodus!
Great power displayed
Cycle of plagues
Four hundred thirty years in chains
Come to an end
To march again
Proclaim the end of Pharaoh's reign
Lеd by staff and rod
Chosen of God
Descendеd of Abraham
Displacing governments
Mark the Holy covenant
Forge the hope of Israel
To enter the promised land
One day the Chosen One shall lead the way!
You might also like
Shout of the heart of stone
March from Egypt into the unknown
Oh, God of Abraham
Mercy, sacrifice, Passover Lamb
Relentless, the Pharaoh's pride
Recaptured slavery or genocide
Now let the chase begin
His heart of stone reformed
And piece by broken piece
It's hardened once again!



Galloping horses and chariots pursue
Into the desert they charge
Six hundred chosen of Pharaoh break through
Children of Israel, they see you from afar
All the king's horses and all the king's men
Captains and armies obey their decree
Nation of pride and deceit closing in
While a nation of helplessness kept by the edge of the sea
The children of Israel now lift up their eyes
The shadow's approaching their freedom at stake
Chaos and panic and fear for their lives
Death on both sides there is no escape
The Angel of God, the cloud and the fire
It moves from the front to guard the behind
Unto the chosen, a life-giving pyre
A God of confusion unto the blind

Stand still, and see salvation (Stand still, and see salvation!)
Lift up thy rod, stretch forth thy hand (Lift up thy rod, stretch forth thy hand!)
The raging sea divided (The raging sea divided!)
Proceed upon dry land
East wind splits the sea and Israel passes through two walls of grace
Blinded by pride Egypt follows on this fatal chase


And the Red Sea crashes down
The walls destroying all the evil
Raise your eyes, behold: the wicked drown and lie eternally
At the bottom of the sea
I will sing unto the Lord for He hath triumphed gloriously
(Hallelujah)
The horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea
(Hallelujah)
Pharaoh's chariots and his host hath he cast into the sea
(Hallelujah)
His chosen captains also are drowned in the Red Sea
(Hallelujah)
Thy right hand, oh Lord, is become glorious in power
(Hallelujah) (Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah)
Thy right hand, oh Lord, hath dashed in pieces the enemy
(Hallelujah) (Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah)
Though hast overthrown them in the greatness of thine excellency
(Hallelujah) (Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah)
The depths have covered them: they sank into the bottom as a stone
(Hallelujah) (Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah)




The scales have been presented and I have been found lacking
My spirit has been tested and I have been found dead
The verdict is submitted and I have been found guilty
The curse has eaten through me since first I was mislead

Oh, wretched man that I am
Who will deliver me?

Body of death is this corrupted flesh I am wearing
With every breath is this crushing burden that I am bearing
It seems so simple: I'm striving for what I never can be
Guilt is my temple, I cannot escape from this prison of me!

Stumble and fall on my face again
And throw my hands to the sky
Have mercy on my soul and hear my cry
I slowly lift my eyes to see
An ancient cross of the dead
Blood streaming down it into a sea of red
So I rise and run to the shore
Of this sea of righteousness
Sanctified now forevermore
I dive into forgiveness
And float away




And the Red Sea crashes down (And the Red Sea crashes down)
Destroying all my evil (Destroying all my evil)
I sleep beneath the endless waves of Grace (Sleep beneath the endless waves of Grace)
I float within the heart of Peace (Float within the heart of Peace)
At last my soul has found release (Found release, found release)
Within the sea of its eternal resting place (Sea of its eternal resting place)
I'm cleansed within, I'm cleansed without
The Red Sea crashes all around
A baptism a holy trial (The Red Sea crashes all around)
I am overcome and overwhelmed
I take the swim eternal (The swim eternal)
I'm swept away, it washes me (It washes me)
It washes me forever!
