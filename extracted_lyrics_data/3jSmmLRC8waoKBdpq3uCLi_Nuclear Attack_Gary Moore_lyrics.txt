3 ContributorsNuclear Attack LyricsNo, no, no
I don't need nobody to show me the way
Out on the streets they're all living in fear
You can hear their hearts pound as the moment draws near
One push of a button is all it would take
To dress the world in black
One fault in the system, a fatal mistake
And you never come back from a nuclear attack
Stick around and baby you'll see
I'm cold-hearted
The Russians are ready, the U.S. is armed
They try and tell us there's no cause for alarm
If you think you can live like a rat in a sewer
Might stand a chance to stay alive
No one can say, no one knows for sure
Just who will survive a nuclear attack
Cause every hungry woman
You ain't never coming back, no
From a nuclear attack
Oh, no, no, no, no, no
Yeah
Oh
I'm cold hearted
I'm so cold hearted
Oh, yeah
Look out
You might also likeEvery hungry woman
Out on the streets they're all living in fear
You can feel their hearts pound as the moment draws near
You won't know what's hit you, it'll happen so fast
Won't be the time to even scream
You'll just be burned up by the heat of the blast
A thing of the past in a nuclear attack
I'm cold hearted
I'm so cold hearted
Nuclear attack
You ain't never coming back
Ain't never coming back, no
No, no, no
From a nuclear attack, oh
You ain't never coming back
In a nuclear attack, ah
Oh, no, no, no
AhEmbed
