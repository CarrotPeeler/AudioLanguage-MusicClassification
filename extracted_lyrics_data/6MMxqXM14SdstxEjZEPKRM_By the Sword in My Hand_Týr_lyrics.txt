A boy gone astray
Deceived by a God
Remembers the day
Bereft of his blood
Much too your dismay
Now equal we meet
Self righteous repay
You kneel by my feet, I stand

By the sword in my hand
I will conquer the land
I will decimate and decapitate
Those who question the sword in my hand

I seek what you took
I promise you'll pay
By hook or by crook
A boy gone astray, I stand

By the sword in my hand
I will conquer the land
I will decimate and decapitate
Those who question the sword
I stand
You might also likeBy the sword in my hand
I will conquer the land
I will decimate and decapitate
Those who question the sword in my hand

I hold the final truth of all eternity
Happens to include my own superiority
Mischief of the past has come to seal your destiny
Kneel before me now or I will have your head for heresy


By the sword in my hand
I will conquer the land
I will decimate and decapitate
Those who question the sword
I stand
By the sword in my hand
I will conquer the land
I will decimate and decapitate
Those who question the sword in my...

I hold the final truth of all eternity
Happens to include my own superiority
Mischief of the past has come to seal your destiny
Kneel before me now or I will have your head for heresy4Embed
