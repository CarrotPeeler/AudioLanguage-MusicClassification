1 ContributorMake Her Mine LyricsSilence gets closer
Sarcastic routine
Problems are growing somber
Stories are written entirely itself
Lend me near, bring misery my friend
Make her mine, make her mine
Standing in the line, make her mine
Make her mine, make her mine
Standing in the line, make her mine
In the beginning
There's nothing to fear
How could I explain it better
Should have been wiser
It's been far too long
There's too many ways
To say what I'm gonna say
Make her mine, make her mine
Standing in the line, make her mine
Make her mine, make her mine
Standing in the line, make her mine
A nature like your scan
Turn trouble to good
I'm changing my weapon
To arrow and bow again
Make her mine, make her mine
Standing in the line, make her mine
Make her mine, make her mine
Standing in the line, make her mineSee Jay-Jay Johanson LiveGet tickets as low as $36You might also likeEmbed
