3 ContributorsToo Damn Bad LyricsBaby when you left
Got your bags all packed
Now you change your mind
And you wanna be back
I say it's too damn bad
Too damn bad for you
Oh I would like to help you honey
But it's too damn bad for you
The grass is looking greener
On the other side
You found your sugar daddy
But I know you ain't satisfied
Weel it's too damn bad
Too damn bad for you
I would like to help you honey
But it's too damn bad for you
So you're calling in your phone
Like a dog without a bone
Your tail between your legs
You say you wanna come back home
Well it's too damn bad
Too damn bad for you
Oh I would like to help you honey
But it's too damn bad for youYou might also likeEmbed
