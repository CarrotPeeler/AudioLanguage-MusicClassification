1 ContributorPlace for Me LyricsThere's a place in this world
Where light is so intense
And everything is shining
Like a hundred suns
No clouds no leaden skies
I can see real colours
No clouds no leaden skies
I'm not blind like before
Everything is close to me
I can almost touch the stars
Nothing hidden, all in view
Space is not so far
Shiny dust whirls in the air
Fields are dancing with the wind
All my senses wide awake
It's real it's not a dream...
It's just a place for me
In this place I wanna stay
My eyes opened night and days
No more problems
Life is easy
It's just a place for me
I don't want anything else
I don't care about the rest
I only know I love you
And you are in this place...You might also likeEmbed
