The way we're living is worse
Pillars of inspiration are all falling down
The clean-up won't work
While the fallout goes on
And it's now or never
Too close to the latter
We're all living proof that nothing lasts
Standing in the neutral zone
Living on sleep deprivation
The rural route sleeps
While the city bleeds all over itself
Over the falls in a barrel
Is where the answers have gone
And it's now or never
Too close to the latter
We're all living proof that nothing lasts
Here for now
Transient tomorrow
We're all living proof that nothing lasts
The Mother Road remains
It provides no more
It can only take us away
Southbound, you can taste the weather
It feels like home
You might also likeNow or never
Too close to the latter
We're all living proof that nothing lasts
Here for now
Transient tomorrow
We're all living proof that nothing lastsEmbed
