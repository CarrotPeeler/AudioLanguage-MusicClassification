2 ContributorsEverything You Say LyricsTired of being seen as a bird in a cage
Tired of being heard all he did last week
Obviously you want to be me â€˜cause everytime
When I fall you're the first to reveal me
Live for yourself instead
Do me a favour
Feed your empty head
You drive me close to the edge
Everything you say, you say it to annoy me
Watching every move I make whenever I'm around
Everything you do, you do it to destroy me
Waiting for the darkest hour to put me down
Time is gradual, the surface is all you can see
And if I told you the truth you will not understand me
Feed your empty head
Do me a favour
Live for yourself instead
You drive me close to the edge
Everything you say, you say to annoy me
Watching every move I make whenever I'm around
Everything you do, you do it to destroy me
Waiting for the darkest hour to put me down
