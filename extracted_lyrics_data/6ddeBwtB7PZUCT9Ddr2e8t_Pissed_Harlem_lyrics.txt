1 ContributorPissed Lyrics
You look like you got your clothes off and sweeped the floor
Not everything's shiny as a diamond

Tell your mama
Tell your paw
Tell everybody that you ever saw
I'm coming home and I'm gon' be kinda pissed

My teeth bit my mouth, oh like sexy housing
Oh you little person

Tell your mama
Tell your paw
Tell everybody that you ever saw
I'm coming home and I'm gon' be kinda pissed

I sit around all day
Waiting for the call
That I'm gonna ignore
I sit around all day
Waitin for a call
That I'm gonna ignore
You say that we are friends
Who you tryna fool?
You ain't a friend of mine
Oh you say we are friends
Who you tryna fool?
You ain't a friend of mineYou might also likeEmbed
