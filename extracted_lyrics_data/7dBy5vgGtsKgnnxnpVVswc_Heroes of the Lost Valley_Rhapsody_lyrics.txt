4 ContributorsHeroes of the Lost Valley Lyrics



Yes, mighty warrior,​
What you hear now
Are the suffering voices of all the heroes
That crossed these lands before you.​
They ended their quest tragically
But their thirst for victory is still alive,​
And breathes through these ancient rocks
Corroded by the fury of the wind.​
Their pride now rides with you.​You might also likeEmbed
