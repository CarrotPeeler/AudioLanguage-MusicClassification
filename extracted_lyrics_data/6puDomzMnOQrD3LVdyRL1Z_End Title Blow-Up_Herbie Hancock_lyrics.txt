7 ContributorsForum Cypher 2 Lyrics
Thy tongue is thy sword, since, the vocabulary minces as the cutlery
You pastry bakers? Simmered and elementary, while my skills are culinary
These dishes I throw out, so gustatory to the buds
That I have FDA Inspectors constantly, triple-checking
For GMO’s in my cooking, so I informed them straight up
“Ain’t no hoes, allowed in this kitchen!”
They walked in disappointment, chuckled “You better or
I’ll make that swine snout, oink!” hot pointy-poking, these porky pigs
So my internal temperature cooled down as my Wellington’s rose
In the oven, the gluttons salivate, ravenously waiting
For my waiters, to dish out the weighted plates
Saw my rivals in sawed halves, who entitle themselves sous chefs
(Ha) More like the main course, served to my dinner guests!
Prepping Dr. Seuss, to be broth in this batch, of Egyptian soup
You fishes will be grilled, next to my Red Snapper, and Blue Bass
Lambs to be chopped then slaughtered, with the force of Wu’s crew

Got bitches is my crib and them bitches working
Louis with the Gucci niggas say I’m perping
AK-47 bitch I need a turban
Lambo on The Lodge bitch you see me swerving

I got bitches
You got bitches
Tell yo bitches come over
If they ratchet lets get ratchet and pull up in that ‘rover
You might also like
Bars I got bars
Bitches at the bars
I drop bars
Fuck yall, I got bars

Public Enemy mixed with YG, what’s that make me?
Lyrically I intimidate and educate thee
I’m the white boy knowing about COINTELPRO
So when I see racism I know how far back it goes
But y'all ain’t looking for conscious flows so
I tear up my home state harder than RTJ
When they came with Che and the Brusier Brigade
Tore up St. Andrew’s and left the smoldering decay
With Danny Brown putting the remains in an ash tray
Got me hyped enough to punch Floyd Mayweather in the face
Knock his teeth out and call it a day
Except Manny would have my head so let me collect it
I see the bodies of wack MCs let me inspect it
You hear this shit and you gotta respect it
You gonna re-read this shit and say
Damn Quikstik wrecked it!

All I see is snitches
All I get is bitches
If you talk shit then yo bitches get put in ditches
Put this shit into reverse meaning I shift sticks
This code is hard to crack, but fuck a @Kryptic

I come down from a loose high
When I walk through you know these geese fly
I keep it real cuz that’s what I was born to do
You call yourself bad bitch but i'v met worse than you
I come up with the weed like shottas
Big like poppa I tell them nada for the prada
They come back wit the pistol and shoot gratatta
But believe me i’m not fazed i’m not bothered
Keeping it real but always feeling managed
Bounce back from rockets with no collateral damage
Put your whole goddamn career in a casket
Do I love her I tell her don’t ask it
She’ll be set up for disappointment
I ain’t her shrink I don’t take appointments
They come at me with potions for my emotions
In rap I get promotions move through the ranks without motion

Check, His palms, spaghetti
Knees are weak, arms, spaghetti
There’s vomit on his spaghetti already
Mom’s spaghetti, he’s nervous
He’s about to eat cold spaghetti
He’s not ready, but he keeps on forgetting
To reheat spaghetti, all the guests cry so load
He opens his mouth but spaghetti won't come out
He’s running out, of the house to get some more spaghetti
But he’s too late, the spaghetti shop’s closed, blaw
I be that rap subzero/kano
Combating hatin' mortals
With the God-leeeeee flow
Entangled in the 90's
Lost in toonami
A break come on
And I’m writing flames, yo
Cross the room
Big bro bumping new hov
Plottin on how to cop brand new clothes
Cause pops lost his job and school coming up
And he can’t stand the fam being broke
But to me it’s watever tho
Long as the fam whole

Coming with these lyrical tactics I’m always active never passive
Steady rhyming through my passage making these classics
Lines always fantastic the impact I make is massive
While other rappers don’t even get you out your seat like you Degrassi
Unlike these other people I actually have character
Not putting up a drake image, you’re just a character
I’m telling you the story of me and I’m the narrator
I’m giving you these bars so you see that I’m a rare master
Yeah, rap is a form of escape to ignore all the mistakes through the doors that we take
Yeah, I adore all the hate, see the form that I’m shaped is a form of a great
See when I’m done with this no one’s a contender
You weak rappers got nothing on me, you’re just pretenders
You moving that dope? Well you got no future
I’m a machine the way I’m bending these bars, like Bender

Me spitting bars for you, is gods gift from heaven
My shit bout to blow up… 9/11
When I spit this shit it’s not written
My lyrics free… Abe Lincoln

This man’s as manic as a panic racked drug addict trapped
In the attic
Snackin' on a packet of crack, laughin', I just snapped my back in half
And happened to slap my lats with my calves
But happy, I’ve done the math
And my ass’ll get smashed off four caps of this bagfull of xanax I jacked
I’ll get wacked now, pass out, take a nap in the bath after collapsin' and drown
Drag my haggard ass up outta the ground, come back as Macbeth’s phantom
And slap the crap outta the masses with a black jack-o-lantern and a five hundred pound crown
I’m the town’s, angry maggot
Braggin' about hatchin' dastardly plans on my hammock
Practised, snatched a backpack rapper by the straps and snagged ‘em on a branch, cacklin’ at him till he got frantic
Stabbed him with my hand, snapped his neck back, and
Body slammed him into the ground so bad he backfired and span straight offa the planet
I’m Bruce Banner’s fuckin' loose cannon, manhandlin' Batman’s masseurs then crammin' the dead goose’s head through a fuckin' noose hangin'
As loose as Marilyn after Jack banged her kaboose
And her shoes cost a grand and
Abuse used to prove who’s husband was a man, (yuh)

To yous who abuse and misuse the celestial lyrics
Putrid and stupid, too useless to earn the best of these merits
So Imma prove to you the true inhuman rapping assassin
The loins of the blessed
The fusioned fruit of this passion
Who’d imagine I’d suit the views of this ludicrous public?
Use the jew’ls of this music
To form confusive constructives
Become the Tantalus in his chasm
Inobtusely known for his actions
No, sanction, Illmatic
Gift n’ curse, everlasting
First verse profusely enpackaged
Wrap it loosely in leafs of amusement refusal
Rappings: then thrown in a hearse
Better best of the worse
Than lucrative n’ a mess
As ruthless and beautiful
As the claims of the rest
Brains immersed n’ produced
In my grade A diction seduced
Syllables n’ sibilance
Burstin’ta flames is evident
And so hence the illusion
Of an immense insane an allusion
Included in this fuckin’
Rudeness accusions I got
For ‘em crappy modern day Judases

Movin dope is my past present and Future
If my mound was any bigger you’d see me on reuters
Cooking for two birds, only ones my bitch
Sit there and watch while I feast on this shit

Rest in peace to the game cause I’m fresh to death
Rest in peace to the game, tell ‘em kill theyself
Make your deathwish, cause I’m too fresh
Cuse I’m fresh to death, cause I’m fresh to death
You go broke tryna get fresh like this
Rest in peace to the game cause I killed it
I’m fresh to death, I’m fresh to death
What you talkin’, I came out a coffin

I Spit Hot Bars From The Place Where We Make Cars
So Hungry I Just Ate A jar, Prolly Gonna Get Charged
For This Crime Im Gonna Commit Tomorrow
Youll See Me With A Lot Of Sorrow, Gonna Need To Barrow
Money to post my Bail, Walk Out With A Tale To Tell My Kids Why I Wasn't Around Cuz I Was In Jail

Taking chains and snatching names, wise eyes you can’t deceive
Wear a vest, cover it up, but your heart’s on your sleeve
Bandwagon lifers die for a dollar and live for a dream
But when life catches up, and the years flash the tears stream
You talk like you’re rich and you’re getting that guop
But your lips like Earls if they Pinocchio’s — Stop
Drop and roll another joint, lick another blunt
Smoke it, toke it, blow it — now you know that shit’s a front
Empty purpose to go with an empty purse
Trying to build an empire off of a curse
My pattern switches up, but my delivery is terse
While repetition degrades the charts, only getting worse
Pillage and rape the youth with the media
Empty carcass, zombie to push the flesh, meatier
Kill the mind, obliterate a generation like a meteor
Spread the message to your family, it’s from me to yours

Don’t call no ambulance
Call the morgue
I ate a sandwich
Slamming your head in the door

You talk like you’re rich and you’re getting that guop
But your lips like Earls if they Pinocchio’s — Stop
Drop and roll

My dick is as big as the big show
Get everyone excited, call it the big show
I don't give a fuck but I ain't a virgin
Come here I'ma open you like a surgeon
Yeah I fuck bitches, call it bestiality
I only love the ac in actuality
Yeah i fuck bitches, yeah call me calles
All these hoes goes around like propellers
Couldn't even spell it, but i could really care less
Yeah the pussy ball like hairless

Took my time off the RG Center
But now I been sent ta re-enter
Cause it seems like y'all need mentors
Won’t be gentle, so gee, temper
By the way, do y'all miss your bitches?
I threw them into ditches along with The_Midget
Yeah, fuck all these snitches like Jay-Hovas_Witness
Y'all should better be able to take a few stitches
Cause when I begin Steb-ing, you’ll lose one of your digits
Now I got everybody watching, even Hopsin's
Sittin their with a pack of corn
But this shit ain’t stopping
And anyone who wants to be topping
Me, just try and we’ll see you flopping
You should start robbing
Cause while rapping, you’re just sobbing

Y'all be making it rain, while I reign supreme
Better leave me BE, before I rupture your spleen
Cause me, I’m like the A-team can't you SEE?
This is the new regime
When I’m busting the chrome and fucking hoes its the same results, bitches scream
I just spilled purple drank on my skinny jeans, but my pockets are never lean
I can Son you, your nothing but a sweet 16, pre-teen
And I can Kill you, don’t make this the post murder scene
More dope n' sick then gingivitis in the mouth of a crack fein
Hit with you that iron, since you under a G like a golf tee
Your bullshit is exactly what I need, an eagles feast
Other then that your just for the birdies
You bogus times three, call that a triple bogey
Like I’m always on weed, my drive is to stay on that green
And you on a crash course, you’ll never be up to par
Don’t even COME close, cause I’m FUCKING winning by far
Out of this world boy..
I TRAVEL the galaxy and DOUBLE DRIBBLE shooting stars
I lay my foot down, and it just so happens my armrest is planet mars
I’m absolutely nuts that’s food for thought, I spit granola bars
Have them fucking dumbfounded, when they find your dead body in a smart car
When discussing the best, my name pops up more then the trunk a-jarred
Rhymes are nothing ever less then rated R
The murderous paramedic that doesn’t take victims to the E-R
I rather whip around the 1st made hummer cause I’m ready for that war
BOY!!

Last night, got caught in a gunfight, I think it was like
Four niggas clutchin they burners and bustin
But only could see one in sight
The one on my right, yo son he like we both got gripe
He wanted my life, come at a nigga
With a gun and a knife
He tryin to make me the wiped out nigga layin up under the white
But I ain’t tryin to go up in no dark tunnel
And burn to the light
And let myself be one more nigga that just got spun in the night
And done in on sight, and tryin to breathe
With one in my pipe
But I’m not one of the type, and I’d rather lose all hung on the mic
Than to be up in the yard receivin CPR
At one in the night
Now I can run and take fllght, but alright, yo son’ll be hyped
And I’ve played mother nature before
So yo I’m clappin thunder tonight
I step right, inside of the street light, my gun it was bright
Send him to kiss Christ, and let my shit slice
In front of him twice
Let one splice, cause fuckin with price, ain’t tryin to be nice
I want him on ice, no back home
To a son and a wife
He tried roll dice with real life and got his buns in a vice
Nigga was all enticed to lead his life sheist
But none of it’s nice
I peeped shit, and seen his whole click, was runnin in fright
Instead of comin to fight, get someone to fight
You son of a dykes
With one in the pipe, I’m aimin to light the one on the right
They all deceased, so yo my asspiece
Get hunted for life
Four niggas cut down, and I can receive one hundred to life
Up in a jailcell, that’s crawlin with lice
And runnin with mice
Live trife, fillin appetities with nothin but rice
Slow biz and no kid’s nigs
Start runnin my wife
Only got one life, yo get this fuckin, gun outta my sight
Back at the house, after midnight
I’m done for the night

I suck cock like a pornstar
All these fake rappers in this cypher too lame, I'm the only to raise the bar
If you see me in the club, hit me up and in the bed we can spar
But I ain't gay, nah the rappers in here are
They so gay, they fap to Spongebob and Patrick the Star
Now I'm going to end my verse with a quotable that will be out of the blue
Rap Genius dot com is full of homophobes, and you know this shit is true

When you speak about the best mc you best to mention me
You couldn’t win this bout with four more mouths
An extra set of lungs and a crooked referee
When I look in your direction, freeze
I’m the hip hop police, may I see your license and registration please

I go low fast and get high slow; viscosity
I just seen some faggot slanging his cock at me
I’ve been killing this for years, ain’t no bitch stopping me
Rollercoasters my dick’s long as these

Don’t disgrace the game, I’m chasing fame
With a pen recreating lanes away from lames
So when I’m on track, i’ll race to aim above space and planes
Claim this title and embrace this reign

Close the curtains
New chapters
Less burdens/bird dens
We the rap raptors
Snatch ya chain
Captors of this game
Steady adaptors
But money gains maintain the same
For who aims for the last laughter
Sinister winner
Pass the spliff to yo' pastor

Killin' these bitches like I'm Michael Vick
I know I’m the best so hop of my dick
And yo “Bad Bitch” look like my shit
And she got those pink pussy lips
Watch out for gun cause I'm murkin' niggas down
TU TU TU is how my gun sounds
You faggot ass niggas don't know bout murder
I’m the best in the game just like Richard Sherman
Bobby Shmurda fucks males and his faggot ass “gang"
When I see this bitch I'ma hit him with a bang
GS9 like to fuck guys in the ass
While Glo Gang looks in the dumpster for cash
At least I’m honest to the rap game
I’m just tellin' the trust so who you gonna blame?

I’m a young but powerful female, you could call me weeping Willow
And when I’m comin' for y’all niggas, I’m sneakier than the bugs lurkin’ in ya pillows
I may not be an emcee, but watch me go harder than a crescendo
I'ma eat ya 16 bars and leave ya broke ass with zero
What, you scared
I’m stuntin' on y’all niggas
I may be new to this but I got more dedication than winners
I’ve never been the type to kick it, coolin' with the sinners
Whats funny though is that I broke the worst commandment and swerved past my haters
Can’t believe I’m sittin' here tryna' out-rap niggas when I’m a beginner
But moms told me thats the type of shit that makes you bigger
I’m on the come up, dodging from the lames
If you don’t like it then you can stay in ya fuckin' lane
Cause this the shit that shows you females can play in the same game
I be spitting these sound waves, the type is sine like the ocean
Hoping I get signed and see these quotients
And if you thought I cared about your notions, just know, if you ain’t notice
I can’t even look at you because this flow is frozen
I’m ice cubing it with these potions
Today was a good day, don’t kill my vibe, or that’s your soul floating
I’m not even human, my soul’s been ghosting
That's abnormal
Mind like 90’s ho, I’m isotopin'

In a world of wills and won'ts
I live by will and refuse to want
Born in the ashes of burned plants
In the realm of glass homes
Cold blooded with warm bones
I withstand the impact of verbal stones
As the minutes pass by my hearing is no longer intact
The audio of my cardiovascular fades
Stillborn memories are still born inside my brain
Mixed with strange feelings of glory days
No longer panicking cause i can no longer think (let that sink in)
10 minutes have passed and fire is alive on my skin
Dead thoughts with a dead heart is that a sin?
And to think smoke could kill two birds with one stone
A shame really my life no longer reflects my tone
With dead words i breathe life into mics
With no life i let the mic take lives
Animated, who am i to tell i made it?

If you thought it was over, I'mma bout to come and finish you
Damn, doing those, done damaging, diminish you
I'm the one to hold the weapon and hit you in the chest
JC Assassin, bow down to the best
You asthma attack when I splat a TEC bullet
Don't be fucking with my trigger I'mma pull it
This the type of terror that takes the two towns
Mix the liquor with the quicker and tear the roof down
Emcees can't handle this sickness
Hit a brotha in the chest and I do it with the quickness
You got no hope messing with the man who shot twice
I been thinking bout my existence and your lost life
Assassin passing the clashing to fasting and blasting
Laughing packing the sack in, attacking to last kin
Freaking phantoms forgiving Father for filling you
Keeping kilts to crazy, cannot contain we killing youEmbed
