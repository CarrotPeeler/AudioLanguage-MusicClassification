3 ContributorsWhen You Were My Girl LyricsWhen you were my girl, there were times you'd look at me
And I knew exactly, how it felt to be loved
When you were my girl, I don't know if I told you
But whenever I'd hold you, it scred me so much

Not a day goes by I don't think of you
(Do you... Ever... Think.. Of me when you're alone)
Or I don't ask myself why
(Do you... Ever... Wonder how things have gone)
If everything's so perfect now
(Do you ever... Think of me and start to cry)
Why do I cry all the time
I didn't cry
When you were my girl
When you were my girl
When I was your man, if I took you for granted
Please understand it was my foolish heart
Girl you were my best friend, baby your love complete me
I loved you completely, just as you are
And if you couldn't feel that, then how I regret
That I never told you, all the things I should've said
But I guess that's the one chance i'll never get
You might also like
Not a day goes by I don't think of you
(Do you... Ever... Think.. Of me when you're alone)
Or I don't ask myself why
(Do you... Ever... Wonder how things have gone)
If everything's so perfect now
(Do you ever... Think of me and start to cry)
Why do I cry all the time
I didn't cry
When you were my girl
When you were my girl
I don't understand why
We let something so beautiful
Just fade and die
We should have tried
One more time
When you were my girl
When you were my girlEmbed
