Go west, paradise is there
You'll have all that you can eat
Of milk and honey over there
You'll be the brightest star the world has ever seen
Sun-baked, slender heroine
Of film and magazine

So, go west, paradise is there
You'll have all that you can eat
Of milk and honey over there
You'll be the brightest light the world has ever seen
The dizzy height of a jet-set life
You could never dream

Your pale blue eyes, strawberry hair
Lips so sweet, skin so fair
Your future bright, beyond compare
It's rags to riches over there

San Andreas fault moved its fingers through the ground
Earth divided, plates collided, such an awful sound
San Andreas Fault moved its fingers through the ground
Terracotta shattered and the walls came tumbling down

Oh, promised land (Oh, promised land)
Oh, wicked ground (Wicked ground)
Build a dream, tear it down
Oh, promised land (Oh, promised land)
What a wicked ground (What a wicked ground)
Build a dream, watch it all fall down
