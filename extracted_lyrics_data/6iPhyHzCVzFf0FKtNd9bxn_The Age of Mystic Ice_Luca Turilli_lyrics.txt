2 ContributorsThe Age Of Mystic Ice Lyrics

She remembers only her wasted ship's name
The fallen giant Dark Comet S-10
Nothing more can she recall than her mind's death
While the black spheres
Are now moving around

Where the legend hides the truth
At the clash of sun and moon
And moved by magnetic fields
Comes the mystic last eclipse
It will ride the Zaephyr's plains
In the evil cosmic name
All the nightmares will soon rise
In the age of mystic ice
Mystic ice


"Sania" will be her new name now adopted
Word that means "gift"
"Golden gift of the gods"
But her smile is lonely in this sad dark day
For even magic, the ice covers all
You might also like
Where the legend hides the truth
At the clash of sun and moon
And moved by magnetic fields
Comes the mystic last eclipse
It will ride the Zaephyr's plains
In the evil cosmic name
All the nightmares will soon rise
In the age of mystic ice
Mystic ice


Where the legend hides the truth
At the clash of sun and moon
And moved by magnetic fields
Comes the mystic last eclipse
It will ride the Zaephyr's plains
In the evil cosmic name
All the nightmares will soon rise
In the age of mystic ice
Mystic ice
The age of mystic iceEmbed
