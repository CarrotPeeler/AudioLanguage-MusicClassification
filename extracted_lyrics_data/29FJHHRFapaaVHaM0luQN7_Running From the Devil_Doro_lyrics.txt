The earth is shakin' - Nobody fears
Homes are burnin' - Nobody cares
As long as no one around us is getting' hurt
We're running from the devil
The devil in you and me
Too late to live in heaven
Destroyin' all we need
Running from the devil
We're running from the devil
From the devil
The devil in you and me
Too late to live in heaven
Destroyin' all we need
Running from the devil
It's getting closer - Can't go away
Can't puch it over or make it go your war
We feel the danger - Nobody cares
As far as no one around us is getting' hurt
We're running from the devil
The devil in you and me
Too late to live in heaven
Destroyin' all we need

We're running from the devil
Running from the devil
The devil in you and me
Too late to live in heaven
Destroyin' what we need
We're running from the devil
Running from the devil
The devil in you and me
Too late to live in heaven
Destroyin' what we needEmbed
