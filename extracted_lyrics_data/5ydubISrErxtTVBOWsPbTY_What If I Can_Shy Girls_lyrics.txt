3 ContributorsWhat If I Can Lyrics

I wanna let myself go there
I'd like to know if it's the way I've dream about it
Can I be the one you tune your heart to?
And can I be the one you shut your eyes to? Oh-oh

What if I'm the one to take yours clothes off? Oh, yeah
What if I'm the one that's really listening? Yeah, yeah
What if I'm the one to make you rise up? Oh, uh
What if, what if I can? Uh

I think about you in the evenings
I hear your voice in the room when nobody's here, oh
Let me wrap myself around your fingers, yeah
And let me show you how I really feel about you

What if I'm the one to take yours clothes off? Oh, yeah
What if I'm the one that's really listening? Mm
What if I'm the one to make you rise up? Oh, yeah
What if, what if I can? Uh-uh-uh
You might also like
What if I can? Oh
I can be your one, and I want, I can be yeah
I can be like
What if I, what if I, what if I, what if I can?
