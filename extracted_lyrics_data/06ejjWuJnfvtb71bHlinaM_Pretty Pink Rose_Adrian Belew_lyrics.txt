3 ContributorsPretty Pink Rose Lyrics
She's just been to Russia and they're dying their faces
They're dying over there
A pretty pink rose

That rock and roll lady takes a space-ship ride
She's out of this world
A pretty pink rose

And we're living for you, my love
We're living for you
And we're dying for you, my love
Pretty pink rose
She tore down Paris on the tail of Thom Paine
But the left wing's broken, the right's insane
A pretty pink rose

Ah, have a nice day, it's a killer, turn a cheek
It's a Christian code
A pretty pink rose

And we're living for you, my love
Yes, we're living for you
And we're dying for you, my love
Pretty pink rose
Woo-hoo
Woo-hoo
You might also like
She's the poor man's gold, she's the anarchist crucible
Flying in the face of the despot cannibal
Pretty pink rose

Never let it rain, never rain on the heart of the pretty pink rose

Pretty pink rose

And we're living for you, my love, we're living for you
And we're dying for you, my love
Pretty pink rose
Woo-hoo
Woo-hoo

Get me thru the pain, thru the pain of the thorn on the pretty pink rose
Never let it rain, never rain, never rain on the pretty pink rose

Take me to the heart, to the heart, to the heart, of the pretty pink rose
Never let it rain, never rain, never rain
Take me to the heart, to the heart, to the heart
Never never let it rain, never let it rain
Take me to the heart, to the heart, to the heart, of the pretty pink rose
Never let it rain on the heart
Take me to the heart, to the heart, to the heart
Take me to the heart, to the heart, to the heart, of the pretty pink rose
Take me to the heart, to the heart, to the heart
Never let it rainEmbed
