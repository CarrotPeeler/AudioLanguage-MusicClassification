2 ContributorsIn the Darkness LyricsHe was looking for a reason, maybe searching for a dream
Decided to get involved with the forces in between
As his fingers did the talking to a faceless entity
Promises of endless pleasure and the road to ecstasy
In the darkness, in the darkness let the light shine through
In the darkness, in the darkness let the light shine through
Troubadour hung up his spurs, been tortured for his tunes
The air was still heavy, no joy amongst the ruins
The dance has stopped, the silence roared, nothing ancient left behind
A vacuum to big to fill, and the words no longer rhyme
In the darkness, in the darkness let the light shine through
In the darkness, in the darkness let the light shine through
Let the light shine through
Let the light shine through
He's on this road to hell, tried to be invisible
Takes courage to resist, which seems impossible
He still hung on to his dream, only way to pretend
Welcome to this book of faces, still searching for a friend
In the darkness, in the darkness let the light shine through
In the darkness, in the darkness let the light shine through
In the darkness, in the darkness let the light shine through
In the darkness, in the darkness let the light shine through

Let the light shine through
Let the light shine through
Let the light shine throughEmbed
