3 ContributorsDARK AGES Lyrics
Anzu

Ever since I think, dark ages all around me
I wish they'd left me drowning
No, they didn't leave me, so I'm running with a dagger
It's for the better
The night comes in as the day goes by
I just wanna feel alive
Tell me, how long can you hide?
Are you up to fight?
Dark ages all around me, praying for god's sake now
All emotions in me dying and I don't know how
Life is so harsh and I don't know if I want that show
Dark ages all around me

Dark ages, dark ages, dark ages upon me
Dark ages, dark ages, dark ages cursed me
Dark ages, dark ages, dark ages upon me
Dark ages, dark ages, dark ages cursed me

Dark ages follow me, dark ages upon me
Dark ages follow me, dark ages upon me
You might also like
Fuck, I'm so tired, man, fuck, I'm so stressed out
I eat once a day, wait 'til the night knocks my lights out
Oh my god, has it really come that far? What the fuck?
I don't wanna do this, I just wanna fucking stop
But I can't, and it's okay
Dark ages upon me

Dark ages, dark ages, dark ages upon me
Dark ages, dark ages, dark ages cursed me
Dark ages, dark ages, dark ages upon me
Dark ages, dark ages, dark ages cursed me
Dark ages, dark ages, dark ages upon me
Dark ages, dark ages, dark ages cursed me
Dark ages, dark ages, dark ages upon me
Dark ages, dark ages, dark ages cursed meEmbed
