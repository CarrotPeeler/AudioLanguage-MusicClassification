6 ContributorsGone with the Sin Lyrics
I love your skin
Oh-so white
I love your touch
Cold as ice
And I love
Every single tear you cry
I just love the way
You're losing your life

Woah-oh, my baby
How beautiful you are
And, woah-oh, my darling
Completely torn apart
You're gone with the sin, my baby
And beautiful you are
So gone with the sin, my darling

I adore the despair
In your eyes
I worship your lips
Once red as wine
And I crave for your scent
Sending shivers down my spine
And I just love the way
You're running out of life
You might also like
Woah-oh, my baby
How beautiful you are
And, woah-oh, my darling
Completely torn apart
You're gone with the sin, my baby
And beautiful you are
So gone with the sin, my darling


Your turn

Woah-oh, my baby
How beautiful you are
And, woah-oh, my darling
Completely torn apart
You're gone with the sin, my baby
And beautiful you are
So gone with the sin, my darling3Embed
