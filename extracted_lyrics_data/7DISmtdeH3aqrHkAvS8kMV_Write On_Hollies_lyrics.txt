2 ContributorsWrite On LyricsWrite on, even though there's no one listening to your songs
Write on
Shine on, get it together, let your light break through
Shine on, baby, shine on
Write on, sitting on your own, waiting for the phone
Come on, come on, come on
Write on, for your fame and fortune will follow you, coming on strong
Coming on strong
Don't feel bad 'cos the radio ain't playing 'em
It won't be long til you're going out and slayin' 'em
Shine on
You're not the first, you won't be the last
To feel the frustration of a musical fast
Write on, baby, write on
Sing your rock and roll with a touch of soul
Ballads with feeling, send your audience reeling
Rock on, rock on
Find a man with a van, a back up band
Who'll give you a hand on your one night stand
Rock on, baby, rock on
Give 'em your licks, getting off on their kicks
Swayin in motion to a rhythmic potion
Rock on, baby, rock on
You might also likeMusic freaks and all those hustlers
Hangers on, trying to make a con
Rock on
Don't sign on the line til you know it's all fine
It's your life baby, you got to give it time
Rock on, baby, rock on
Write on, even though there's no one listening to your songs
Write on
Shine on, get it together, let your light break through
Shine on, baby, shine on
Don't feel bad 'cos the radio ain't playing 'em
It won't be long til you're going out and slayin' 'em
Shine on
You're not the first, you won't be the last
To feel the frustration of a musical fast
Write on, baby, write on
Sing your rock and roll with a touch of soul
Ballads with feeling, send your audience reeling
Rock on, rock on
Find a man with a van, a back up band
Who'll give you a hand on your one night stand
Rock on, baby, rock on
Give 'em your licks, getting off on their kicks
Swayin in motion to a rhythmic potion
Rock on, baby, rock onEmbed
