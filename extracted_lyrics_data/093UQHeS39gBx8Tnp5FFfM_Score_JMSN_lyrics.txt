I saw the future clear
How did we end up here
I damn near lost my mind
(Tryna' cover up the pain)
Did what I thought I should
Just wanted to feel good
Now I don't know what's right
(Cause I only feel ashamed)

See I'll do what I got to do
Cause I'm not one to sit and wait
Not gonna sit and wait
Everyone lies it's true
But I want you and there's no debate
No, there's no debate

Shoulda loved you better
Shoulda loved you more
Shoulda loved you better
But who's keeping' score
Shoulda loved you better
Shoulda loved you more
Shoulda loved you better
But who's keeping' score

All the blood, sweat and tears
'Bout time I face my fears
I've gotta make this right
(Before I make the same mistake)
No I won't waste your time
Won't leave you high and dry
Cause life goes by too fast

See I'll do what I got to do
Cause I'm not one to sit and wait
Not gonna sit and wait
Everyone lies it's true
But I want you and there's no debate
No, there's no debate

Shoulda loved you better
Shoulda loved you more
Shoulda loved you better
But who's keeping' score
Shoulda loved you better
Shoulda loved you more
Shoulda loved you better
But who's keeping' score
Apologize a million times my baby
Apologize a million times
