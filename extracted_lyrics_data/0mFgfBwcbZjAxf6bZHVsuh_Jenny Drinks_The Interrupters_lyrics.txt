9 ContributorsJenny Drinks LyricsJenny drinks
Everything and the kitchen sink
Until she's all messed up and she can barely think
Jenny cries
And then she sighs her final goodbyes
Doesn't wipe the teardrops from her eye
'Cause she's on the brink
She said, "The world just ain't ready for a spirit like me
I never been so frustrated with humanity
And I suppose that I'm the one who seems crazy
But the world just ain't ready for a spirit like me"
Jenny smokes
Until she chokes and she's flat broke
And her lungs are all caked up
With a flat black coat
Jenny laughs
But she'll fight back to show her pack
That her kindness ain't no weakness
And she'll react
I said, "The world just ain't ready for a spirit like me
I never been so frustrated with humanity
And I suppose that I'm the one who seems crazy
But the world just ain't ready for a spirit like me"

I never been so frustrated with humanity
And I suppose that I'm the one who seems crazy
But the world just ain't ready for a spirit like me"
Jenny waits
She'll invite you in for a Jameson
She's a saint, although ya know she likes to sin
She don't budge
She don't judge, she's full of love
At the very least, she's always interesting
Come on, the world just ain't ready for a spirit like me
I never been so frustrated with humanity
And I suppose that I'm the one who seems crazy
But the world just ain't ready for a spirit like meEmbed
