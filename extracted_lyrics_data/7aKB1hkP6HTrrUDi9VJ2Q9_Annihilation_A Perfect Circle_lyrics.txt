8 ContributorsAnnihilation LyricsFrom dehumanization to arms production
For the benefit of the nation or its destruction
Power is power, the law of the land
Those living for death will die by their own hand
Life's no ordeal if you come to terms
Reject the system dictating the norms
From dehumanization to arms production
To hasten the nation towards its destruction
Power is power, the law of the land
Those living for death will die by their own hand
Life's no ordeal if you come to terms
Reject the system dictating the norms
From dehumanization to arms production
To hasten the nation towards its destruction
Power is power, the law of the land
Those living for death will die by their own hand
Life's no ordeal if you come to terms
Reject the system dictating the norms
From dehumanization to arms production
To hasten this nation towards its destruction
It's your choice, your choice
Your choice, your choice
Peace or annihilationYou might also likeEmbed
