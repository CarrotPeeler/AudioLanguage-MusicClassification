"Good Golly", said little Miss Molly
When she was rocking in the house of blue light
Tutti Frutti was oh so rooty, rocking to the east and west
Lucille was oh so real when she didn't do her daddy's will
Come on, baby drive me crazy, do it, do it

'Cause I'm a speed king, you gotta hear me singing
Yeah, I'm a speed king, see me fly

Saturday night and I just got paid
Going to fool about isn't going to save
People gonna rock, people gonna roll
Going to have a party to save my soul
Hard-headed woman and a soft-hearted man
They've been causing trouble since it all began
Take a little rice, take a little beans
Gonna rock and roll down in New Orleans

'Cause, I'm a speed king, you gotta hear me singing
Yeah, I'm a speed king, see me fly, oh
You might also like
Oh, oh, come on, oh, oh, ohhh!
Ha, ha, ha

Take a little rice, take a little beans
Gonna rock and roll down in New Orleans

'Cause I'm a speed king, you gotta hear me singing
Yeah, I'm a speed king, see me fly
I'm a speed king, you gotta hear me singing
Yeah, I'm a speed king, see me... hahahahahahaha
Yeah, I'm a speed king, you gotta hear me singing
Yeah, I'm a speed king, see me, ohEmbed
