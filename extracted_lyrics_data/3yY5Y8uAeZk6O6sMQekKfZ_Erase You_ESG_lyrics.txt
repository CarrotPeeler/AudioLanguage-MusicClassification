3 ContributorsErase You Lyrics
Sweet L
Listen to my story
Up off the sidelines
You really really bore me
You come to get me in your stinky clothes and hot rods
And think I should jump like a puppy to your side
But I got news for you fellas
Get real
I'm gonna erase you
Just like a drawing
Erase you
Flush you like my toilet
Erase you
Show you I'm a woman
Erase you
This is what I feel like

Pump it up girl
Pump it up
Yeah
One night, I was out with Tony
He had on so much gold, but it was phony
An Alexander suit, JC Penney boots
He brought me flowers from the garbage chute
I had to set him straight, baby squashed his date
Then I kissed him, smacked him, dismissed him
Then you know what I said?
You know what I said!
Erase you
You know that
Erase you
You street rat
Erase you
Just like a drawing
Erase you
Flush you like my toilet
Erase you
Show you I'm a woman
Erase you
This is what I feel like
Pump it up girl
Pump it
Yeah
Pump it up
Erase you
Try some deodorant
Erase you
You know that
Erase you
Just like a drawing
Erase you
This is what I feel like
Pump it up
Yeah
Come on girl
Pump it up
Yeah
Erase you
Erase you
Erase you
Yeah Sweeto I'll listen to your story
Uh-uh, he don't do that
No he don't do that
He ain't nothin but a dog
Did you know he just got outta jail?
Mm-hmm, yeah, yeah, yeah
