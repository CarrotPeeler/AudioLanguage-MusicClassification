5 ContributorsI Go Crazy Lyrics
I go crazy when I'm without you
I go crazy when I'm without you

What have I done today?
Just sat and watched the jets fly over
A car goes by and the sun goes down we talk about the town
This city's mad in the head and sick in the soul
All the stars flew away a long time ago
Isn't that nice like Miami Vice

I go crazy when I'm without you
I go crazy when I'm without you

Well your life is like an infant's dream it's like everything's on TV
You see your face in the mirror could it be your place in the mirror
And so we turn on the TV one more time
And we see that everything is fine

But what have I done today?
I go crazy
What have I done today?
I go crazy when I'm without you
I go crazy when I'm without you
What have I done today?
What have I done today?

Sue-Ellen looks so upset
This isn't the first time and it won't be the last
There's things going on behind her back
Oh, they give you a heart attack

I go crazy when I'm without you, go crazy
I go crazy when I'm without you, go crazy

I go crazy when I'm without you
But what have I done today?
I go crazy
But what have I done today?
I go crazy when I'm without you
I go crazy when I'm without you
Go crazy
I go crazy when I'm without you
What have I done today?Embed
