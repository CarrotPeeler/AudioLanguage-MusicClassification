1 ContributorWalkin’ Naked Thru’ a Bluebell Field LyricsI've sat in Alleyways
And spoke to buildings
I've worn a womans body
To provoke a male
I've spread emotion lotion
On ma feelings
To clean the river
That's running thru me
I'd like to sail on the ocean of love
But the wind said :
"This boat ain't goin nowhere
Without a breeze"
My mind
Has been twisted
Reformed
Conformed
And deformed by someone
I met by complete chance
In a bluebell field
I'd like to hold you tight
Hold you close
Cover your mouth
Burn all your clothes
Chorus
Walkin naked thru a bluebell field
So much laughter
Should intensify the real
Walkin naked thru a bluebell field
I'd like to kiss your hips
Lick your lips
Shed my soul
+ Blind fold ya
Chorus
I'd like to f**k your aura
And when I have the time
I'd like to unscrew your mind
Chorus
I'd like to tell your mama
Tell your pa
Bout the "thangs" we did
In their backyardYou might also likeEmbed
