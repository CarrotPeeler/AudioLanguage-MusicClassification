The devil sent me a gift, an invitation met
A face from the deck, coalescing influence
From the void
By a thread, the words entwine
Moving late in the middle of the fallout, taken by familiar sight
A tongue cuts the iron sleep
Wanting to know my name

I am nothing but the way down
A crude malevolence that surrounds
All these secrets will allow us
To become greater than our fractions
Dragging under hands of stone

Now there is a point inside, disguised within myself
Fighting to resist the hand at play
Never let it speak its mind, never let it speak its mind
If you let it speak its mind, you forfeit the right

To leave this place
A vicious cycle holding on
To leave this place
Anew, remade, the cycle holds
We leave this place
We know, we know
We leave this place
We know where we're going â€” all the way down!
Now make us the same!
Taken over, taken over
Make us the same
Taken over
Thank God in the end for nothing, my friend!
You might also like
But the way down
A crude malevolence that surrounds
All these secrets will allow us
To become greater than our fractions
Dragging under hands of stone!

The silence speaks
All these secrets come undone!
Taking me over, over
The silence speaks
All these secrets come undoneEmbed
