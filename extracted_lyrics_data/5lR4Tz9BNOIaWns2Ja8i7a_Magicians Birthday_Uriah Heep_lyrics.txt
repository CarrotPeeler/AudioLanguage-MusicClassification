In the magic garden
Some were singing
Some were dancing
While the midnight moon
Shone brightly overhead
The stars so gaily glistened
And the sphinx in silence
Listened to the magician tell
Of lives that he had led

Let the bells of freedom ring
Songs of love to friday's king

Let's all go to
The magician's birthday
It's in the forest
But not so far away
Much to do
And so much to say
While we listen to the
Orchid orchestra play

Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to magician
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you
(Happy birthday, the magician)
Happy birthday to you
(Happy birthday, to you)
Happy birthday to you
(Happy birthday, the magician)
Happy birthday to you
(Happy birthday, to you)
Happy birthday to you
(Happy birthday, the magician)
Happy birthday to you
(Happy birthday, to you)

Then at the dead of midnight
As we watched the dancing
Firelight, the air grew cold
And seemed to dull the flame
The fire died
The music faded
Filled with fear of death
We waited, for now we knew
Some evil was to blame

I challenge you
I challenge you all
For all you own
And all you know
And by all the powers of darkness
I will steal what is mine
Surrender now or face my spite
I grant you it may be friday night
But did you know this day
Also numbers thirteen

First I give you fire
I turn your fire into a sleepy stream
Yes, now I give you nightmare
And from your horror I'll create a dream
You cannot fight me
For I have the sword of hate
But one thing you can't see
My answer is simply
An impenetrable fortress
Of love
Love
The fear went as quickly as it came
The air was clear
The fire burned again
The flames leapt
The organ played
The swans sang
To greet the day
And then we knew that
Love will find love will find love

Will find love, will find love
Will find love, will find love
Will find love, will find love
Will find love, will find love
Will find love, will find love
Will find love, will find love
Will find love, will find love
Will find love, will find love
Will find love, will find loveEmbed
