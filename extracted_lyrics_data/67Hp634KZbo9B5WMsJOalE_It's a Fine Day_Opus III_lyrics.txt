It's a fine day
People open windows
They leave their houses
Just for a short while
It's a fine day
People open windows
They leave their houses
Just for a short while

It's going to be a fine night tonight
It's going to be a fine day tomorrow
It's going to be a fine night tonight
It's going to be a fine day tomorrow

It's a fine day
People open windows
They leave their houses
Just for a short while
They walk by the grass (they walk by the grass)
They look at the sky (the sky, the sky, the sky)
They walk by the grass
And they look at the grass
They look at the sky (the sky, the sky, the sky)
It's going to be a fine night tonight
It's going to be a fine day tomorrow
It's going to be a fine night tonight
It's going to be a fine day tomorrow
