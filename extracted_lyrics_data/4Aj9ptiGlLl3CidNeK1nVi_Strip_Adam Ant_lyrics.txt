It's at times like this the great heaven knows
That we wish we had not so many clothes
So let's loosen up with a playful tease
Like all lovers did through the centuries

We're just following ancient history
If I strip for you, will you strip for me?
We're just following ancient history
If I strip for you, will you strip for me?
Uh-huh-huh

When it gets so hot, the end of the day
You may find your clothes getting in the way
If a pretty dress hides your true desire
Fold it nice and slow, throw it on the fire

We're just following ancient history
If I strip for you, will you strip for me?
We're just following ancient history
If I strip for you, will you strip for me?
Uh-huh-huh
You might also like
We don't need to see what the butler saw
Or a mirrored room with a mirrored floor
All those sneaky looks gazing down on you
Are no substitute for our rendezvous

We're just following ancient history
If I strip for you, will you strip for me?
We're just following ancient history
If I strip for you, will you strip for me?
Uh-huh-huh

It’s at times like this that great heaven knows
That we wish we had not so many clothes
So let's loosen up with a playful tease
Like all lovers did through the centuries


If you think it's cheap or a bit risqué
Please don't say a word, I'll just slip away
I am not a man who believes in lies
Like an octopus with the x-ray eyes
Don't freeze up, girl, you're looking quite a sight (Uh-huh-huh)
Be generous (Uh-huh-huh), I want it all tonight!

We're just following ancient history
(Don't freeze up, girl, you're looking quite a sight)
If I strip for you, will you strip for me? (Uh-huh-huh)
(You got it, be generous, I want it all tonight!)
We're just following ancient history
(Don't freeze up, girl, you're looking quite a sight)
If I strip for you, will you strip for me? (Uh-huh-huh)
(Be generous, I want it all tonight!)
We're just following ancient history
(Don't freeze up, girl, you're looking quite a sight)
If I strip for you, will you strip for me? (Uh-huh-huh)
(Be generous, I want it all tonight! You got it!)
We're just following ancient history
(Don't freeze up, girl, you're looking quite a sight)
If I strip for you, will you strip for me?Embed
