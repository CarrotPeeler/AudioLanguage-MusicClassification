3 ContributorsHow Do You Sleep? Lyrics
Boy, you tried to make a mess of me
Tear me down and make me believe
Thank God I didn't fall too deep
Why'd you try to make a mess of me?
There was something 'bout the things you said
Just to try to get into my head
Go lie in that empty bed
Boy, you know now just what you did

So tell me why you're trying so hard
Well, just to break my heart
Kept on pulling me in
Thought I would give in
So tell me (Tell me) before (Tell me) I leave (Tell me)
How do you sleep?

Wish I could erase you from my mind
Take away the pain I feel inside
Like a fool you didn't realize
Boy you know I saw right through your lies
I'm gonna throw all those things away
You gave to me to make me wanna stay
I heard you never, never can anyway
Don't think that I'll be coming back someday
You might also like
So tell me why you're trying so hard
Well, just to break my heart
Kept on pulling me in
Thought I would give in
So tell me (Tell me) before (Tell me) I leave (Tell me)
How do you sleep?


So tell me why you're trying so hard
Well, just to break my heart
Kept on pulling me in
Thought I would give in
So tell me (Tell me) before (Tell me) I leave (Tell me)
How do you sleep?

Sleep
How do you sleep?
Sleep
Sleep
Sleep
