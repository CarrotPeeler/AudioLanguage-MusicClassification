(Butt nut)
I've been taking abuse, and it's senseless
(Fist-fuck)
Fist into the wall, and it's painless
(Ass-suck)
I've been living the lie that I made me
(Dump truck)
Live it

(Butt nut)
Screaming into the mic, and I like it
(Fist-fuck)
Put it all over the air in thick slices
(Ass-suck)
Soak it all up in your head with the anger
(Dump truck)
Like it

And grind on it
(Fist-fuck) Brush the surface off
And grind on it
(Ass-suck) Brush the surface off
And grind on it
(Dump truck) Brush the surface off
And grind on it
(Butt nut) Brush the surface off
And grind on it
(Fist-fuck) Brush the surface off
And grind on it
(Ass-suck) Brush the surface off
And grind on it
(Dump truck)

Put a gun in my mouth

Put a gun in my mouth
And threaten to shoot
