5 ContributorsDance With U Lyrics
Take my hand, I got a place for you
Out on the dance floor
One more time, I wanna rendezvous
Out on the dance floor

Feel the night
In a four-four time
As I lose my mind to you again (to you again)
If I ever said goodbye
I would lose my mind to you again (to you again)

Turn the lights down now
Turn the music loud
I wanna dance
Lights down now
Turn the music loud
I wanna dance

I wanna dance-dance
I wanna dance-dance
I wanna dance-dance
(All I wanna do)
Dance with you
Dance with you
You might also like
Don't forget, I think I always knew
Out on dance floor
Can't nobody, move the way you do
Out on the dance floor

Feel the night
In a four-four time
As I lose my mind to you again (to you again)
If I ever said goodbye
I would lose my mind to you again (to you again)

Turn the lights down now
Turn the music loud
I wanna dance
Lights down now
Turn the music loud
I wanna dance

I wanna dance-dance
I wanna dance-dance
I wanna dance-dance
(All I wanna do)
Dance with you
Dance with you
Dance with you
Dance with you
Gonna take the ride
Gonna take a ride and dance with you
Gonna take the ride
Gonna take the ride and ride and ride
Gonna take the ride and ride and ride
Gonna take the ride and ride and ride
Gonna take the ride and ride and ride

Turn the lights down now
Turn the music loud
I wanna dance
Lights down now
Turn the music loud
I wanna dance

I wanna dance-dance
I wanna dance-dance
I wanna dance-dance
(All I wanna do)
Dance with you
Dance with you
Dance with you
Dance with youEmbed
