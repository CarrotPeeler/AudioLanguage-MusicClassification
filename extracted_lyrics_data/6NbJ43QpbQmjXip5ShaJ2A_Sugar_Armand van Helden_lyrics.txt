I know you ain't capable
Listen, honey, I ain't mad
I know you ain't stable
Listen, sugar, it's cold
I know you ain't capable
Listen, honey, I ain't mad
I know you ain't stable
Let the matter shit, I'm used to it
Bitches like you pulling tricks
Just steal your tongue, 'cause it's saying shit
I guess I have my feelings quit
And you leave me no option but, to turn and hurt you
Because I prefer to avoid trouble
It's just so time consuming
I prefer to avoid trauma
It's just so time consuming
Listen, sugar, it's cold
I know you ain't capable
Listen, honey, I ain't mad
I know you ain't stable
Listen, sugar, it's cold
I know you're not capable
Listen, honey, I ain't mad
I know you ain't stable

Always get you want and I don't get a say
You think that you own it, well you can have it and keep it
I just don't wanna hear 'bout how you know that I need it
Well fine, fine baby, now I ain't got the time, time, baby
'Cause someday you'll prefer to avoid trouble
It's just so time consuming
I prefer to avoid trauma
It's just so damn time consuming
Listen, sugar, it's cold
I know you ain't capable
Listen, honey, I ain't mad
I know you ain't stable
Listen, sugar, it's cold
I know you're not capable
Listen, honey, I ain't mad
I know you ain't stable
