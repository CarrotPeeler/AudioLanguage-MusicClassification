Just to be there by your side
I’ve felt the water
As it's river flows to dry
The night sky warms me
Tell me, should I close my eyes
Those lights that blind me
Say you, "just you step inside"
Right by your side
Right by your side
Ooh how you keep patience safe lies
Crossing this ocean's too wide
How could that warmth be the right sky
Crossing to be by your side
Right by your side
Right by your side
I’d cross the ocean
Just to be there by your side
I’ve felt the water
As it's river flows to dry
The night sky warms me
Tell me, should I close my eyes
Those lights that blind me
Say you, "just you step inside"
