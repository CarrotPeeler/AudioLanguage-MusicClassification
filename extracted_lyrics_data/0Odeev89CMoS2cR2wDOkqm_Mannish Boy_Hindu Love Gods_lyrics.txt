2 ContributorsMannish Boy Lyrics
When I was a little boy about the age of five
My mama told me I'd be the greatest thing alive
Now I'm a man, haha, way past twenty-one
Come on, honey, we'll have lots of fun

I said M, A, child, N
I represent man, ha
That indicate I'm grown, hey
But when I say, "Wang"
That mean mannish boy

I see that woman standin' in that light
I'll make love to ya, baby, for three hours time
What 'nother man? Hey!


And when I shoot, won't ever miss
I'll make love to your cousin, oh, she can't resist

I said, M, A, child, N
That indicate "man," hey
When I say, "Wang"
That mean mannish boy
I'm a man
Hoochi koochi man
Natural born lover's man
I'm a rollin' stone
I'm a rollin' stone
I'm a rollin' stone
I'm a rollin' stone
I'm a rollin' stone

Well, I'm going down to Kansas City
Bring back my second cousin, Little John the Conkeroo

I say M, A, child, N
And that indicate I'm grown
I'm a man
Hoochi koochi man
Natural born lover's man
I'm a rollin' stone
I'm a rollin' stone
I'm a rollin' stone
I'm a rollin' stone


I'm a man
I'm a man child
I'm a man
I'm a man child
I'm a man
I'm a man
I'm a rolling stone
I'm a rolling stone
I'm a rolling stone
I'm a rolling stone
And when I say, "Wang"
That mean mannish boyEmbed
