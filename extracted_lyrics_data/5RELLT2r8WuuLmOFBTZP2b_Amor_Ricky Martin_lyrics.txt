3 ContributorsAmor Lyrics
Amor, only in a dream
I ever thought you'd find me
Amor, fell into a kiss
And left the world behind me

Easy to believe my lies
And never know it
Easier to throw it away
Now I look into
Now I look into her eyes
And I can see it
I know the reason to stay
Although they say

Deja, deja
Cuida'o que te quema
They'll say it over again
Amor te quema
Pero, deja
Lo hago por ella
I'd do it over again
Sólo por ella

Amor, never was a touch
Enough to just persuade me
Amor, now that I can feel my heart
My thoughts evade me

Easy to believe my lies
And never know it
Easier to throw it away
Now I look into
Now I look into her eyes
And I can see it
I know the reason to stay
Although they say

Deja, deja
Cuida'o que te quema
They'll say it over again
Amor te quema
Pero, deja
Lo hago por ella
I'd do it over again
Sólo por ella
Easy to believe my lies
And never know it
Easier to throw it away
Now I look into
Now I look into her eyes
And I can see it
I know the reason to stay
Although they say

Deja, deja
Cuida'o que te quema
They'll say it over again
Amor te quema
Pero, deja
Lo hago por ella
I'd do it over again
Sólo por ellaEmbed
