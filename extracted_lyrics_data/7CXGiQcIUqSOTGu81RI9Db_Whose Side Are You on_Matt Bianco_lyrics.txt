2 ContributorsWhose Side Are You On LyricsOne empty place
At the table for two
Our agent in Rome in
A cafe rendezvous
A seat is soon taken
A contact is made
Surveyed by another
Whose secret is saved
Whose side are you on? x4
Hmmm, yeah
The courier falls
The coffee was drugged
The waiter makes off with - the microdot
You don't have to believe
To play that double cross
Spying for the side
That pays them the most
Whose side are you on? x4
Whose that someone on the inside
An undercover mole?
To late to use a lie detector
Now some heads will roll

Ba do da do da
Do do do do do do do
Do do do da da, ba da da
Da da da do do da da
Da da da da da da da
Ba do do do do do do do do do
Do da da do da
Ba da do da dah
(continue 'til end)
Whose side are you on?
Whose side are you on?
Hmmm, yeah
