3 ContributorsNight Songs LyricsWorkin' this job ain't payin' the bills
Sick and tired rat race takin' my thrills
Kickin' down the road, not a dime in my pocket
Night time falls and I'm ready to rock it, ooh
I need a shot of gasoline
I'm hittin' one sixteen
I get so hot, I see steam
Forget the day, 'cause we're gonna scream
Night songs, howl into the light, singin'
Night songs, makes the day right
Night songs, raise your glass, take a bite
Night songs
Ridin' to the east and ridin' to the west
Sleepin' all day, but never get a rest
Lookin' at the time stand still, it ain't right
Livin' for the moment, time to get it tight
I need a shot of gasoline
I'm hittin' one sixteen
I get so hot, I see steam
Forget the day, 'cause we're gonna scream
Night songs, howl into the light, singin'
Night songs, makes the day right
Night songs, raise your glass, take a bite
Night songs

I'm hittin' one sixteen
I get so hot, I see steam
Forget the day, 'cause we're gonna scream
Night songs, night songs
Night songs, night songs
Night songs, night songs
Night songs, night songsEmbed
