Well I'm a crawlin' king snake, and I rule my den
I don't want nobody hangin' around with my little girl now
I'm just gonna use her for myself
You got me crawlin' baby when the grass was very high
I'm just gonna keep on crawlin' now baby until the day I die
Cause I'm a crawlin' king snake and I rule my den
I don't want nobody hangin' around with my lady
I'm just gonna use her for myself
I'm gon' crawl to your window baby
I'm gon' crawl over to your door
You've got everything I want now baby
I wanna crawl up on your floor
Cause I'm a crawlin' king snake, and I rule my den
I don't want nobody hangin' around with my little girl
I'm just gonna use her for myself
Yeah I'm a crawlin' king snake, and I rule my den
Baby I'm a crawlin' king snake, and I rule my den
I don't want nobody hangin' around with my little girl
I'm just gonna use her for myselfYou might also likeEmbed
