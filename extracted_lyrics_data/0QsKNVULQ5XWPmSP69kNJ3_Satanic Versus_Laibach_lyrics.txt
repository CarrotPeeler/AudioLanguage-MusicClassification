3 ContributorsSatanic Versus Lyrics
Express yourself
Express yourself
Express yourself
Express yourself

Express your grief, your faith, belief
Express your self-appreciation
The dignity of life and death
With culture and civilization
With time for sympathy and time for action
Express revenge and condemnation
Your sense for freedom, justice, peace
Express your global politics
„The Rights of Man“, the enterprise
The free will and the unbroken one
Your self-esteem and self-desire
Your trust in God and in religious fire
The end of reason and the end of science
The end of family, the end of violence
Satanic verses of your superstition
The land of plenty and of ammunition
„The End of History“, the end of time
The end of music and the end of rhyme
Express the immaculate control
Express the inexpressible
Express yourself as the leading nation
The first, the second, third world domination
Impress with stars and stripes forever
Conspiracy of terror and salvationSee Laibach LiveGet tickets as low as $65You might also likeEmbed
