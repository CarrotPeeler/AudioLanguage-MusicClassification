2 ContributorsWheelchair Hooker Lyrics
Come on, let's roll

Tempting woman
Turning tricks on the street
Sweet honey dripping fuckhole
My favorite pile of meat
Lovely woman
I wanna take you home
Strip you naked, tie you down
And cover you with cum

There's nothing else that I'd rather do
Than to be rock 'n' rolling with you

Your legs, your arms
Don't work and that's your charm
No legs, no arms for you
Your legs, your arms
Don't work and that's your charm
No legs, no arms for you
Wheelchair hooker
You might also like
Damn hot Woman
Good-looking like a dog
You turn me on
You limbless fucking hog

There's nothing else that I'd rather do
Than to be rock 'n' rolling with you

Your legs, your arms
Don't work and that's your charm
No legs, no arms for you
Your legs, your arms
Don't work and that's your charm
No legs, no arms for you
Wheelchair hooker

Why don't you roll on over?

Your legs, your arms
Don't work and that's your charm
No lеgs, no arms for you
Your legs, your arms
Don't work and that's your charm
No legs, no arms for you
Wheelchair hooker
Your lеgs, your arms
Don't work and that's your charm
No legs, no arms for you
Your legs, your arms
Don't work and that's your charm
No legs, no arms for youEmbed
