As days go by

I'm missin' you baby
Patient waiting for you
To hold you
To thrill you
To fill you
With tender kisses
Give you the love you've been missin'
Oh I can't wait till you come back home
To have you all alone (as days go by)
I'm missin' you baby
Patient waiting for you
To hold you
To thrill you
To fill you
With tender kisses
Give you the love you've been missin'
Oh I can't wait till you come back home
To have you all alone (as days go by)

Now I done came a long way, but ain't, too far
And hope, this love letter don't leave, a big scar
So baby, just hold on, and mama, just be strong
Cause no one
Knew the war would last for so long
The rockets, the red glare, the bombs up in the air
I'm just, doin' my duty, but missin' it right there
So as days go by, I'm coutin' every minute
Wishin' I was home, for sure, with you in it
But the soldiers that I'm runnin' with are ready to blitz
This ain't no video, this is just as real as it gets
I made some life long friends, holdin' down the front line
And girl, I can't wait to get back in your sunshine

I'm missin' you baby
Patient waiting for you
To hold you
To thrill you
To fill you
With tender kisses
Give you the love you've been missin'
Oh I can't wait till you come back home
To have you all alone (as days go by)
I'm missin' you baby
Patient waiting for you
To hold you
To thrill you
To fill you
With tender kisses
Give you the love you've been missin'
Oh I can't wait till you come back home
To have you all alone (as days go by)

Now as days go by, my time was spent reflectin'
On all the little things, you said, I was neglectin'
They say
You never know what you have until it's gone
Didn't know back then but I will from now on
When I try to channel out all the fear and the stress
I picture me and you rollin', lookin' dressed to impressed
Sendin' notes, you'll be there, when I'm back from Iraq
If you're good, to have a real chica, havin' my back
Give everybody hugs and tell 'em, "I really miss 'em
Man, your boy be back, when I'm through with my mission"
Give everybody hugs and tell 'em, "I really miss 'em
Man, your boy be back, when I'm through with my mission"
I'm missin' you baby
Patient waiting for you
To hold you
To thrill you
To fill you
With tender kisses
Give you the love you've been missin'
Oh I can't wait till you come back home
To have you all alone (as days go by)
I'm missin' you baby
Patient waiting for you
To hold you
To thrill you
To fill you
With tender kisses
Give you the love you've been missin'
Oh I can't wait till you come back home
To have you all alone (as days go by)

To have you all alone
As days go by
As days go by
One day we gon' get it together
One day we gon' get it together
One day we gon' get it together
One day we gon' get it together (as days go by)
One day we gon' get it together
One day we gon' get it together
One day we gon' get it together
One day we gon' get it together (as days go by)Embed
