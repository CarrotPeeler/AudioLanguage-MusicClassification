2 ContributorsStory of the Eye LyricsThis foreign face that is looking at me
In absence, I am hanging alone
This lifeless nakedness that devours me
Which is this eye that is looking at me
I see nakedness
I see silence
I can hear you
I hear blood
That screams and swims in reverse
I can hear it now
Sand, please help me
Don't turn back
I hear blood
That screams and swims in reverse
I can hear it now
[This is the air that penetrates you
In the air there is a poison that kills you] 
Sand, sand, sand please help me
Do not turn back, back
'Cause this is the air that penetrates you
Sand, sand, sand please help me
Do not turn back, back
In the air there is a poison that kills you

"Mais qu'est-ce que vous nous foutez là M. Artaud?  Et savez-vous ce que c'est au juste que la cruauté?
C'est l'homme qu'il faut maintenant se décider à émasculer
Dieu, le hasard bestial de l'animalité inconsciente humaine, partout où on peut le rencontrer."
[This is the air that penetrates you
In the air there is a poison that kills you] 

"Lorsque vous lui aurez fait un corps sans organes, alors vous l'aurez délivré de tous ses automatismes et rendu à sa véritable et immortelle liberté."
When, when we hear the eye open
There, there in that place
There, a whisper is a scream
Breathing there, into that place
I know you'll stay
Loneliness is not the same here
It's over for today
Now, again...
Now again...
When, when we hear the eye open
There, there in that place
There, a whisper is a scream
Breathing there, into that place
Breathing there, into that place
When, when we hear the eye open
There, there in that place
There, a whisper is a scream
Breathing there, into that place
When, when we hear the eye open
There, there in that place
There, a whisper is a scream
Breathing there, into that place
Now again, now again, now again
Now!
Now again, now again, now again
Now...Embed
