3 ContributorsTurn Each Other Inside Out Lyrics
Blood of her mystery, bloom of her history
Roots of her blood, perfume of cups
Inner white thigh hidden from sun
Spine tangle knots, poems in her hair

We do it apart, do it in the dark
Teeth tongue, her bite, pulls sheets apart
Blood of her mystery, bloom of her history
Spine tangle knots, poems in her hair

You do, do that hoodoo
You do, do that hoodoo
You do, do that hoodoo
You do, do that hoodoo
Ooh


We do it apart, do it in the dark
Teeth tongue, her bite, pulls sheets apart
Blood of her mystery, bloom of her history
Spine tangle knots, poems in her hair

Turn each other inside out
Turn each other inside out
Turn each other inside out
Turn each other inside out
Turn each other inside out (You do, do that hoodoo)
Turn each other inside out (You do, do that hoodoo)
Turn each other inside out (You do, do that hoodoo)
Turn each other inside out (You do, do that hoodoo)


We do it apart, do it in the dark
Teeth tongue, her bite, pulls sheets apart
Blood of her mystery, bloom of her history
Spine tangle knots, poems in her hair

You do, do that hoodoo (Turn each other inside out)
