6 ContributorsThe Dream Lyrics
Whisper in the yard and turn the trees all into toys
Lay there on the ground and turn the dirt into your joy
From what I see and what I know, it's all been boring lately
So I suggest we trade a question mark in for a maybe
Time your riddles right and make a point that has no sense
Make sure that you're smiling and the money's been well spent
Innocence and ignorance, it all goes hand in hand
I'm not sure that I'm right but I hope you'll understand
I hope that you're still searching for the start that has no end
And all the plastic people have now become your friends
Before you start to drift and your soul begins to scream
I just wanted to tell you that you're listening to a dream (That you're listening to a dream, that you're listening to a dream, to a dream, to a dream, dream, dream, dream, dream, dream, dream, dream, dream, dream, dream, dream, dream, dream)See Shinedown LiveGet tickets as low as $324Embed
