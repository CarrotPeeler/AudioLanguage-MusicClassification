My baby give me high temperature
My baby give me high temperature
One oh one when we kiss and dance
One oh two for a night romance
One oh three four and five it get to hot to stay alive

My baby give me high temperature
My baby give me high temperature
When I see her comin down the street
I feel a fever get to high to beat
One oh three four and five and it gets to hot to stay alive

My baby give me high temperature
My baby give me high temperature
Ninety seven ninety eight it just a false alarm
My temperature 105 hold her in my arms
One oh three four and five and it get too hot to stay aliveYou might also likeEmbed
