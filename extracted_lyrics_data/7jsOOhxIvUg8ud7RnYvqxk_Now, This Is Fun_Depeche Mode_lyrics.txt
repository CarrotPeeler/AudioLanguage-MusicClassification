7 ContributorsNow, This Is Fun Lyrics
Here speaks the voice of reason
It's talking to me, loud and clearly
And, obviously, it's something to say

Here comes another sentence
It is relentless, it tries my patience
But nevertheless, it's for our concern


We can't see the benefits
So we'll ignore it or disobey it
And then we'll say that this is fun

This is real fun
This is real fun (This is fun)
This is real fun
This is fun
This is real fun
This is real fun (This is fun)
This is real fun
This is funYou might also like2Embed
