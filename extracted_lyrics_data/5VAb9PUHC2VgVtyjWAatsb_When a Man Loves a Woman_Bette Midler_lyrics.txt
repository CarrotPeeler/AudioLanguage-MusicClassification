5 ContributorsWhen a Man Loves a Woman LyricsWhen he held me in his arms
When he held me in his arms and said
"Baby, baby, baby, you are the only one for me"
When a man loves a woman, can't keep his mind on nothing else, he'll trade the world for the good thing he found
Yeah, if she's bad, he can't see it, she can do no wrong, turn his back on his best friend if he put her down
When a man loves a woman, spend his very last dime tryin' to hold on to what he needs
Give up all his comforts, go out and sleep out in the rain if she says, "Baby, that is how it's gonna be"
When a man loves a woman, gives her everything that he has
Tryin' to hold on to her precious love, cryin', "Baby, baby, please don't treat me bad"
When a man loves a woman, down deep in his soul, she can bring him such misery
Yeah, she's bad, but, ooh, he's the last one to know, lovin' eyes don't ever see
So this man says he loves me, he loves me, he gives me everything, everything, everything that he has
Tryin' to hold on to my precious love, cryin', "Baby, baby, baby, don't you, don't you treat me, treat me bad"
Oh, yeah
Oh, I'm leavin' him
Oh, when a man loves a woman, he can do her no wrong, he could never hold another girl
Oh, you tell me you love me, baby, and gonna ho-ho-hold me tight, baby, baby, this is a man's world
No, no, oh, baby, a change is gonna come down in this man's worldYou might also likeEmbed
