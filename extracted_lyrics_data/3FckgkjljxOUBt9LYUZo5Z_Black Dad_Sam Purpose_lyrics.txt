1 ContributorBlack Dad Lyrics
Yeah this one for the kings
Future kings
This one for you
Let's go

Uh
This for the ones we fighting for
This for our family
This life we know it is a war
It happens annually
The adversary walkin round here
Stealing sanity
From the kings that dream to bring
A future not a casualty
Taking back the throne up in our home were called to lead the way
For our sons and daughters through disorder must combat to stay
Go away no we won't we gotta choose to go obey
The carnal mind will kill the vibe of hope and peace decreasе today
Yeah uh
Get on your knees a pray
When need thе realest in the field so seeds won't lead astray
Planting the purity in men no 50 shades of grey
Landing maturity begins from birth make no delay
Powerless without the spirit to help do the job
Cause naturally we make mistakes our life is very flawed
I know the norm is not to ask for help its kinda odd
But if we gonna win we gotta spend our time with God

Black dad you the image of a mighty God
Black dad you the realest so I must applaud
Black dad keep ya focus bro I know it's hard
Black dad man you built for this you're no façade
Black dad you the leader shepherd of the flock
Black dad you the keeper treasured more than stock
Black dad a mighty warrior with swag and zeal
Is a black dad a warrior out in the field

To all my fathers throw ya hands up in the sky for real
Don't even bother to acknowledge negative appeal
The potter made you from the dust equipped with every skill
To be your children's chief you're not a bust but made to build
Kill all the drama ain't no need for beef when dad around
Eliminate the thief console the grief erased the frown
We bring the father's joy so we destroy division's sword
Creating memories on Instagram with pics abroad
We not your babysitter club daddy daycare
We are the teachers ain't no sub we the top tier
Intercede on our knees with a war cry
That our kids gonna live and they won't die
Patriarch's
Leading homes
Through the one that's on the throne
Daddy duties in the zone
Made a king and not a clone
Putting food on tables yeah but bringing food right fo they soul
We the ones who reppin' lead'em to the one that saves they soul

Black dad you the image of a mighty God
Black dad you the realest so I must applaud
Black dad keep ya focus bro I know it's hard
Black dad man you built for this you're no façade
Black dad you the leader shepherd of the flock
Black dad you the keeper treasured more than stock
Black dad a mighty warrior with swag and zeal
Is a black dad a warrior out in the fieldEmbed
