3 ContributorsPigtails Lyrics
One too many
Early in the DJ booth
Really make your head spin
Find a place on a stair
In a drawer in the attic
Take it all in
Mmm

Must be the pigtails on your shoulder
Like she wore for me
Mmm

One too many
Early at the back door
Gonna get your head twisted
Mmm
Run back inside
In the noise and the lights think on it
How much I missed it
Mmm

Must be the pigtails on your shoulder
Like she wore for me, yeah
Mmm
Must be the light shining down from the glitter board
Must be the night winding down from the alcohol
Mmm
Must be the pigtails
