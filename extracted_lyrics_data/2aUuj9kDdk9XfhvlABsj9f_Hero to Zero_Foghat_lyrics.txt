2 ContributorsHero to Zero LyricsDrinking champagne, eating caviar
Drivin' around town in a big flashy car
Got two hits both at number one
Yeah, everybody says I'm a son of a gun
Got a big mansion on the top of a hill
Flying my jet gives me such a thrill
Got me an island in a great big sea
Yeah, I can see you but you can't see me
But when the hits stop coming
And the cash begins to dry up
And you change your crystal
For plastic and a paper cup
From hero to zero
The world looks good when you're at the top
From hero to zero
You feel so bad when you start to drop, yeah
{instrumental}
Sitting in your room doing nothin' at all
Can't use the gold hangin' on the wall
Thinking â€˜bout times when you used to be
Now the bubble's burst and it's plain to see

When they know they're on the way down
You were hailed as a king now
You know that you feel like a clown
From hero to zero
A king of the hill sitting on your throne
From hero to zero
You're sittin' in a room feeling all alone
From hero to zero
The world looks good when you're at the top
From hero to zero
You feel so bad when you start to drop
From hero to zero - From hero to zeroEmbed
