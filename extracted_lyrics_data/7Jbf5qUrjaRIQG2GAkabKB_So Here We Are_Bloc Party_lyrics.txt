25 ContributorsSo Here We Are Lyrics
I caught a glimpse
But it's been forgotten
So here we are, again
I made a vow
To carry you home, home
I really tried to be what you wanted
It all went wrong, again
I made a vow
To carry you home
If you fall sick, if you pass out, out

Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh

I figured it out, I figured it out
I figured it out, I figured it out
I can see again, I can see again
I can see again, I can see again, I can see againSee Bloc Party LiveGet tickets as low as $154You might also like11Embed
