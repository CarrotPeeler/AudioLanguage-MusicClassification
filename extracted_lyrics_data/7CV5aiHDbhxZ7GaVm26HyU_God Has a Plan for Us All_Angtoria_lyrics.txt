2 ContributorsGod Has A Plan For Us All LyricsLet his holy choir sing in sodomy, praise be!
Surrender your body and your soul unto him, demoralize me!
So he crept into my room
Whispered my name, took my innocence away
I´m only five, a pervert's concubine
God has a plan for us all
I've been touched by the hand of god
My sordid tale, his lies are blasphemy
You do not believe in him but he believes in you
He wants you to repent all your sins. Let him in, inside you!
God has a plan for us all
You are one of God's children
Get on your knees, Serve him well, my child
I´ve fallen prey to the devil in disguise
God has a plan for us all
Don´t say a word or you'll go to hell
God has a plan for you all
Open up for him; let Jesus in!
His sordid tale, his lies are blasphemy!You might also likeEmbed
