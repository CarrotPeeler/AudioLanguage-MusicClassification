1 ContributorBetterment LyricsI hate this feeling all the time
Like these things I'll never find
I try to see through things I know to be so false
No I'll never again believe in anything
Never believed in anything
Try to see through your mistakes
I knew that things would turn out badly anyway
Still I know you'd never change
Never believed in you
I'm trying to say "Betterment me"You might also likeEmbed
