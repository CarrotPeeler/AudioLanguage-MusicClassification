32 ContributorsRather Die Young Lyrics
Boy, you'll be the death of me
You're my James Dean
You make me feel like I'm seventeen
You drive too fast
You smoke too much
But that don't mean a thing
'Cause I'm addicted to the rush

'Cause I'd rather die young than live my life without you
I'd rather not live at all than live my life without you
'Cause I'd rather die young than live my life without you
I'd rather not live at all than live my life without you

You know I've been in love before
You're the first one I ever seen
That burns like gasoline
So light a match
Turn off the lights
I'm holdin' on to you
'Cause this might be our last night, oh

'Cause I'd rather die young than live my life without you
I'd rather not live at all than live my life without you
'Cause I'd rather die young than live my life without you
I'd rather not live at all than live my life without you (You)
You might also like
What I'm tellin' you
I'm givin' you my life, it's in your hands
And what I'm gonna do
Is be a woman and you can be a man
And I wanna say it
Nobody understands what we've been through
I'd rather give up everything
Than to live my
Live my life without you, ooh, oh, ooh
Ooh, oh, ooh, ooh
Oh, ooh

'Cause I'd rather die young than live my life without you
I'd rather not live at all than live my life without you
'Cause I'd rather die young than live my life without you
I'd rather not live at all than live my life without you4Embed
