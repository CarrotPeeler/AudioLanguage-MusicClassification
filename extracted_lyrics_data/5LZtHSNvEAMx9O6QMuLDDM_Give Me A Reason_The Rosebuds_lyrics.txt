1 ContributorGive Me A Reason Lyrics
Give me a reason, and I will follow
Give me a reason, and I will follow
'Cause you've got a heart, won't make me scared
And I've got a heart that needs repairing

So give me a purpose, something I can be
Give me a purpose, something I can see
'Cause you've got a heart with a certain kindness
And I've got a heart that needs reminding

Whoa, oh-oh, give me a reason
Whoa, oh-oh, give me a heart
Whoa, oh-oh, give me a reason
Whoa, oh-oh

You've got a heart that keeps on growin'
And I've got these broken parts I've been hidin'
So watch your step right here, follow me outside
Your Southern accent caught me by surprise
I've kept myself quiet but I think you might understand
Whoa-oh, oh-oh
You might also like
Whoa, oh-oh, give me a reason
Whoa, oh-oh, give me a heart
Whoa, oh-oh, give me a reason
Whoa, oh-oh, give me a heart
Whoa, oh-oh, give me a reason
Whoa, oh-oh, give me a heart
Whoa, oh-oh, give me a reason
Whoa, oh-ohEmbed
