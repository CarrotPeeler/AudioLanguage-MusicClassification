Ever since the day that you went away
You've been sending flowers to me
Send me no flowers today
Instead of sending flowers come back to me
And hold me in your arms again

There is nothing that a flower can say
That your lips can prove with a kiss
Send me no flowers today
Got a lot of flowers and what I miss
Is being in your arms again

After a break up
To kiss and make up is divine
My darling
It doesn't matter
Just who was right or who was wrong
As long as you're still mine

Call me up and say that you're on your way
Til' you're back how lonely I'll be
Send me no flowers today
Instead of sending flowers come back to me
And love me just as I love you
You might also like
Send me no flowers today
Instead of sending flowers come back to me
And love me just as I love you
And love me just as I love you
And love me just as I love you1Embed
