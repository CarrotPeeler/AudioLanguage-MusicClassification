4 ContributorsBeat Yourself Blind Lyrics
Give me a minute 'cause I'm wrapped in superstition
Pour me a chemical to take away the edge

Don't make up anything that's breakin' all your fingers
Just slap around a bit of what it takes to pledge
No

Carry out another stone as a slave
Ask General Know-It-All "Who's juggling the earth?"

Tease all the natives that will walk across your grave
And shove aside your nation all for what it's worth

Beat yourself blind, beat yourself blind, beat yourself blind
Beat yourself blind, beat yourself blind, beat yourself blind
(An open eyes and a closed mind)

Look at the suit in suspended animation
A faded outline that used to be a man
You might also like
A piece of paper that's fallen out a window
Has got a better chance to know where it lands

Beat yourself blind, beat yourself blind, beat yourself blind
Beat yourself blind, beat yourself blind, beat yourself blind
(An open eyes and a closed mind)

To bleed in vain, to bleed in vain
Under my eyes are painted skies


Down at the boneyard, they're diggin' up the relics
Handfuls of parasites thrown into machines
I got the phone call they're tearin' down the mission
The zombies had a ball, but they don't know what it means
They don't know what it means (Beat yourself blind, beat yourself blind)
No, they don't know, they don't know (Beat yourself blind, beat yourself blind)
No, no, no, no, no (Beat yourself blind, beat yourself blind)
Oh, yeah (Beat yourself blind, beat yourself blind)
No (Beat yourself blind)
They don't know what it means (Beat yourself blind, beat yourself blind)
Blind (Beat yourself blind)
They don't know what it means, oh (Beat yourself blind, beat yourself blind)
They don't know, oh (Beat yourself blind)
No oh, no oh, no oh (Beat yourself blind, beat yourself blind)
No (Beat yourself blind)Embed
