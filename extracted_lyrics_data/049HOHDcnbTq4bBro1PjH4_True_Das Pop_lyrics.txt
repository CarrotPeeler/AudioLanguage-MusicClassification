1 ContributorTrue LyricsWorkers in their worn-out coats
The girls from Ghent
So quiet and content
This is what we came here for :
A friendly word and a cigarette
Cos' it's true what they say
The world just turns around
We'll be happy again
These are the days
We can truly find ourselves
Nothing fancy
Nothing much
The facts of life
We all come across
When your legs have walked enough
We can ride the shabby city bus
Cos' it's true what they say
The world just turns around
We'll be happy again
These are the moments
We just can't live without
These are the moments
We just can't live without

No one's dead just yet (x2)
And it's true what they say
The world just turns around
We'll be happy again
These are the days
We can truly find ourselves
Sunday morning radio
The sun outside nowhere to be seen
Skinny girls and bony boys
Made up the rules
When we came living here
And it's true what they say
The world just turns around
We'll be happy again
These are the moments
We just can't live without
These are the moments
We just can't live without
Though it's sad
No one's dead just yet (x16)Embed
