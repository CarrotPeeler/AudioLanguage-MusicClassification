2 ContributorsBeast of Man LyricsBeware the beast of man
For he's the devil's pawn
Alone among god's primates
He kills for sport, lust or greed
The sacred scrolls
The truth unfolds
Shun him or become like him
Shun him, the beast of man
Let him not breed in great numbers
For he will make a desert of his home and yours
Shun him, drive him back into his jungle lair
For he is the harbinger of death
The sacred scrolls
The truth unfolds
Shun him or become like him
Shun him, the beast of man
Shun him or become likе him
Shun him, the beast of man
