3 ContributorsRhythmeen Lyrics
Solid-silver beat machine
Hunkin' down
Funkin' up on Magazine
On rhythmeen in New Orleans
Drinking Dixie 45 with hot links
In a silver Continental
Wired as hell and doin' things
That's what you get on rhythmeen

Oh yeah, way up
Oh yeah, way out
Uh-huh, get on up
Rhythmeen is down
Rhythmeen thing
Mean mean rhythmeen

Can't get enough of that special sauce
The backbeat's the big boss
Here comes another dope fiend
Trading up for rhythmeen

Oh yeah, weird up
Oh yeah, fear not
Uh-huh, get on up
Rhythmeen is down
See ZZ Top LiveGet tickets as low as $68You might also like
Leaning on a silver Lincoln
A Galaxy 500
In a Mustang might Tchoupitoulas
Rhythmeen up everythingEmbed
