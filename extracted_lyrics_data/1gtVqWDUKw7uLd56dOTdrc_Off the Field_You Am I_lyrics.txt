4 ContributorsOff The Field LyricsI like you taking what you want from me
I like it locked up, and you've got the key
I like your view of me, it's so obscene
Go, lay down, tell me I'm too selfish here
I like you showin' me what I'm missin'
I like it, tell me what I cannot do
I like you out of bounds, or off the field
I like it, beat me down, and make me yield
Yeah!
(I like it)
When I can see you
(I like it)
I cannot be
(I like it)
(I like it)
We're off the field
(I like it)
You broke the yield
(I like it)
(I like it)
We're boyfriends
(I like it)
In fairy-tales
(I like it)
You might also like(I like it)
It's not your turn
(I like it)
Not your concern
Well, I care

Well, I care
Well, I care
Well, I care
Well, I care
Well, I care
Well, I care
Well, I care
Well, I care
Well, I care
Well, I care
Well, I care
Well, I care
