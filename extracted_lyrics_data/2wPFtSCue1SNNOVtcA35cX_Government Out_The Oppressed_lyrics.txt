You listen to their lies
You listen to their propaganda
They're the bastards you despise
Hear the people scream and shout
"We want government, government out!"
Hear the people scream and shout
"We want government, government out!"
Paper cups and olquies 
The tories cut your throat
Neither party give a shit
All they're after is your vote
Hear the people scream and shout
"We want government, government out!"
Hear the people scream and shout
"We want government, government out!"
So who will government opress
When the police rule the state
Will they all listen to Big brother in the year of '88?
Hear the people scream and shout
"We want government, government out!"
Hear the people scream and shout
"We want government, government out!"
Oh yeah!

Don't listen to their lies
Don't listen to their propaganda

Hear the people scream and shout
"We want government, government out!"
Hear the people scream and shout
"We want government, government out!"
You know we want government, government out!
We want government, government out!
We want government, government out!
We want government, government out!
