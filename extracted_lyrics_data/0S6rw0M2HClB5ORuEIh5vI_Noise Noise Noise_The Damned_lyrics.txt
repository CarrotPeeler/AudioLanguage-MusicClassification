7 ContributorsNoise Noise Noise Lyrics
At 7 a.m. on a brand-new day
I'm gonna start it in the perfect way
Put the greatest record on
I kick the dog, I kick the cat
Insult my mum, insult my dad
Scream out loud and sing along

We say noise is for heroes (Heroes)
Leave the music for zeroes (Zeroes)
Noise, noise, noise is for heroes (Heroes)
Oh, yeah

I'm down the pub and the time is one
Hit the jukebox for my favourite song
Gonna turn it up too loud
Have a couple of games of pool
Argue with a drunken fool
Have a beer with the usual crowd

We say noise is for heroes (Heroes)
Leave the music for zeroes (Zeroes)
Noise, noise, noise is for heroes (Heroes)
Oh, yeah
See The Damned LiveGet tickets as low as $52You might also like
It's noise that makes the world go 'round
I can't survive without that sound
The sound torments me

It's eight o'clock down the church hall
I've enough amplifiers, six feet tall
Gonna turn them up full blast
The vicar waves his arms and looks absurd
The noise drowns out his godly words
And he can't get out too fast

We say noise is for heroes (Heroes)
Leave the music for zeroes (Zeroes)
Noise, noise, noise is for heroes (Heroes)
Oh, yeah

Noise, noise, noise
Noise, noise, noise
Noise, noise, noise
Noise, noise, noise
Noise, noise, noise
Noise, noise, noise
Noise, noise, noise
Isn't it nice in here? (Woo)
Isn't it nice in here? (Woo)
Isn't it nice in here? (Woo)
Isn't it nice in here?Embed
