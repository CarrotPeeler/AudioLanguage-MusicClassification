2 ContributorsMonkey Suit Lyrics
See myself off in my monkey suit each day
Then I walk the slow fish ladder
Made of concrete and the bones of people
Ten more minutes 'til my monkey train pulls in
Where the bums all shine like poisoned angels
Smell of diesel stronger than mine

Don't wanna live inside it
Don't wanna waste it dreamin'
Don't let me disappear inside this monkey suit I'm wearin'

How much longer 'til my monkey ship pulls in?
And I sail off to the silent voice
I sail into the white moon
Someone's rattling on my monkey cage all day
Where I peck away the anthill numbers
Peck away my best years


It takes so much to bring me 'round
(Much to bring me 'round)
Without some little lies
The thing where you could anchor yourself down
