5 ContributorsCrucifixion LyricsCrucifixion they called the game
Bestial penalty, a deadly maim
Crucifixion, the way that sinners go
Holy torment, last malice ya got to know
Crucifixion, crucifixion
Bloody Hell, I won't die here
Crucifixion, crucifixion
I'm bloodcovered in pain an' fear
Hundreds of years they raised the cross
Evil dark priest(s), black stones they toss
The bible, it prayses that bloody wood
A priest, he prays with an uncanny hood
Crucifixion, crucifixion
Bloody Hell, I won't die here
Crucifixion, crucifixion
I'm bloodcovered in pain an' fear
Rusty nails send them straight to hell
Illtreated, they just got their souls to sell
Crucifixion, the way that sinners go
Holy torment, last malice ya got to know
Crucifixion, crucifixion
Bloody Hell, I won't die here
Crucifixion, crucifixion
I'm bloodcovered in pain an' fear

A priest, he prays with an uncanny hood
Crucifixion, crucifixion
Bloody Hell, I won't die here

I'm bloodcovered in pain an' fear

"...In the days of Armageddon, starved souls, greedy bodies
Ready to punish, ready to kill
Sword by sword they stand
Strike on strike, faith is dead, Gog and Magog on
Nergal's left hand...
Revelations...
See, the rust gnaws on Michael's mystic sword
Frozen's the lightning in Jehovas hand
Angels it rains from the sky..."Embed
