5 ContributorsItâ€™s All Up to You Lyrics
Got myself in trouble
Really burst their bubble
My head is going schizo
I might embrace or kick you
The nights are bright to dim me
Self-righteous attitudes won't amend me
I've tasted life, it sends me
Only freedom can defend me

(no matter what they say
No matter what they do
It's all up to you)

I got myself a cripple ... when I stepped outside
Didn't kick the circle 'cause it's just a lot of jive
I've got my dreams, I won't work for the man
Whether it's wearing a suit, ... his game plan

(no matter what they say
No matter what they do
It's all up to you)
(no matter what they say
No matter what they do
It's all up to you)

I walk downtown
Where everybody goes
Leave me alone, I won't step on your toes
I've got my plans, and they don't include
Walking down the street in anybody else's shoes
Got myself in trouble
Really burst their bubble
My head is going schizo
I might embrace or kick you
The nights are bright to dim me
Self-righteous attitudes won't amend me
I've tasted life, it sends me
Only freedom can defend me

(no matter what they say
No matter what they do
It's all up to you)Embed
