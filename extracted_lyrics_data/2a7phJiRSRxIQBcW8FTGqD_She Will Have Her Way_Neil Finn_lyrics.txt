8 ContributorsShe Will Have Her Way Lyrics
"I might be old but I'm someone new," she said
"I'm so sore that I could cry always
In the night lay your tired arms"

And she will have her way
Somehow, I will still believe her

She's the life I've been frightened of
Seems like deathly silence and especially the dark
Feels like I am heavy, and my spirit has died

She will have her way
Somehow, I will still believe her
She will have her way
One day I will come back, yeah

'N' doot 'n' doo doo
'N' doot 'n' doo doo
'N' doot 'n' doo doo
'N' doot 'n' doo doo
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah-ah

Still no end in sight
Though I travelled far and wide
A dyin' man is doin' time
Think a soldier terrified

She will have her way
Somehow, I will still believe her
She will have her way
One day I will come back

Doot, doo, yeah
'N' doot 'n' doo doo
'N' doot 'n' doo doo
'N' doot 'n' doo doo
'N' doot 'n' doo doo
Ah, ah, ah, ah
'N' doot 'n' doo doo
'N' doot 'n' doo doo
'N' doot 'n' doo doo
'N' doot 'n' doo doo
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
(Hey)
She will have her way
(Her time was of the day)
Yeah, she will have her way
(She will have her way)
(She will have her way)
She will have her way
She will have her way1Embed
