1 ContributorWhy Donâ€™t You Want Me LyricsFirst you want it slow
Then you want it fast
You know that I gave you
Whatever you asked

Now baby you've got me
Whenever you want me
So why don't you want me?
You begged me to stay
When I tried to go
You told me you loved me
And you'd need me so
And that's how you got me
Just where you want me
Told me "why don't you want me?"
"I just wanna know."
I worked just like a doggone mule
Just to buy you pretty things
And my friends think I'm a real real real big fool
They think you've got me hanging like a puppet
On your string
You might also likeI may be your fool
I may be a clown
I know, I know you want me
Yes I do
Whenever I'm not around


I worked just like a doggone mule
Just to buy you pretty things
My friends and my family
They tell me that I'm a fool
They think I'm like a puppet
Dangling on your string
I may be your fool
I may be a clown
I know,I know, I know you want me
Yes you do
And you need me when I'm not around
Now honey you've got me
Whenever you want me
So why don't you want me?
I know you've got me
Yes you have
I know you've got me
Tell me:
Why don't you want me?Embed
