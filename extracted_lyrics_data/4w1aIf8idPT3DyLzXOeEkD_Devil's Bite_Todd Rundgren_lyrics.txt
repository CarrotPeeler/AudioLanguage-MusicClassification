2 ContributorsDevilâ€™s Bite Lyrics
Who's that knockin' on my door?
Who's that rising up from under the floor?
I know, I can hear that demon roar
But I don't care, I ain't gonna hear it no more

I don't care, I paid my dues last year
Have no fear, now it's time that I clear out of here
Just let you know before I go

Are you devil or death? You'll have to bow
Ain't no power on earth can stop me now
I have done all things that make it right
To keep me out of the devil's bite

Heaven sent me down a sign
Things were bad but now I'm doin' fine
So you better step back 'cross that line
Now I can't see you but for one last time

I can see you marked my life like a scar
So you are but it don't take a star to go far
I'll let you on, before I'm gone
You might also like
Are you devil or death? You'll have to bow
Ain't no power on earth can stop me now
I have done all things that make it right
To keep me out of the devil's bite


I knew someday you'd be along
Swingin' your tail and singin' a dead man's song
Just when things get good you want your take but you're wrong 'Cause I'm leaving this shell and I'm movin' on

Are you devil or death? You'll have to bow
Ain't no power on earth can stop me now
I have done all things that make it right
To keep me out of the devil's bite
Yeah yeahEmbed
