45 ContributorsI Do Adore Lyrics
Everything you do it sends me
Higher than the moon with every
Twinkle in your eye
You strike a match that lights my heart on fire

When you're near, I hide my blushing face
And trip on my shoelaces
Grace just isn't my forte
But it brings me to my knees when you say

Hello, how are you, my darling today?
I fall into a pile on the floor
Puppy love is hard to ignore
When every little thing you do, I do adore

We're as different as can be
I've noticed you're remarkably relaxed
And I'm overly uptight
We balance out each other nicely

You wear sandals in the snow
In mid-July, I still feel cold
We're opposites in every way
But I can't resist it when say
You might also like
Hello, how are you, my darling today?
I fall into a pile on the floor
Puppy love is hard to ignore
When every little thing you do, I do adore

Finding words, I mutter
Tongue-tied, twisted
Foot in mouth, I start to stutter
Ha, ha, Heaven help me

Hello, how are you, my darling today?
I fall into a pile on the floor
Puppy love is hard to ignore
When every little thing you do, I do adore
Every little thing ba ba bap ba
Every little thing ba ba bap ba
Every little thing you do I do, adore16Embed
