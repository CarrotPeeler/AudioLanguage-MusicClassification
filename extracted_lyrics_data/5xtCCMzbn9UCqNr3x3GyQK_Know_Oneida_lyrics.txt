So my loving parents left me in the lurch
A wooden drawer served as my crib
From the evil's of the world hid
But minutes turned to hours
As I slept away the day
No one came to tell me
That my parents passed away
Both were decapitated in a brutal crash
So in this casket drawer is where I'll stay
To live out my end of days
I scream... The Sleeper
And scream...
In total darkness now I reside
To weak to get out from inside
And so my flesh turns putrid, pallid grеy
From my bones it rots away...rots away
So now I just sleep and wait
And Sundays I fucking hate
And I know oneday whеn it's opened up
I'm waking up and coming out!

And scream...
Dream... The Dreamer
Rise... The SleeperEmbed
