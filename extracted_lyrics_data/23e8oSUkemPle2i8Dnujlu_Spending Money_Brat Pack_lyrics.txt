Ball  all round the world so I feel like arenas ---
How shawty round my waist game winner I'm dreamin
Stomp a Christ air in my Timbaland boots
Stomping Christ air I get  higher than Zues
Flip a beat how I flip my hair Jesus
Flip for a brick I  kick push it like lu
Block stayin hot as my corazon in Cancun
I can use my Mac to bloody up ya headphones
Beat the up beat up just to bloody shawty sole
How I shine u can see the caliber of my soul
Pen a bunch of 10s get my cut wit the sword
Turned my pockets vegan so i hold the vegetables
I keep pressing x man
Wrist shine like sentinel
It won't mean a thing to smoke ya like menthol
Do the doobies tho do my thang like Julio
Do a dirty bird but I'm clean and negative
Came out the shell I do spins in the eclipse
Keep spending beat money on maschine and Christine
Screw loose clean Sprite so the weight mo lean
Sprite commercial fingers singing so fresh so clean

I got everything you need in this backpack
Cold steel Kool aid in this backpack
On my Macbook you askin where the trap at
Leave u leaking Kool Aid from ya fuckin back
Since age 2 all I knew was that doot doot doot
Skateboard niggas with the ice cream shoes
Kick push pills to ya dumb ass youth
Breakin up these boxes I’m bandicoot

Glow hotter than
Stove topper
With ink blotter
Got real gwallah
Yo Dolla
Look chupacabra
U Seeing nada
My bank statement like teleprompter
Reading off the O's like
Donald fucking invanka
(I'm fucking bored)
Bad boy mantras
Can't stop us
The force of Zigga hit ya quicker than mom's chanclas
U should be honored
My dog is Goddard
Type to put the metal to ya jaw quick
If u ain't honest
(nigga)
Points is plotted
I’s is dotted
Triple money sign sign on the card swipe deposit
Out of pocket u niggas is Brett farving
In my sack still treating u pack like john marston
Blunts is pterdactyl dust i relax in a button start
Fuck a Marta
Fossils fueling me saying we lost the art

Push boards then i push X
Push boards then i push X
Push boards then i push X
Come start some shit with me push X
Push boards then i push X
Push boards then i push X
Push boards then i push X
Come start some shit with me nigga push X
