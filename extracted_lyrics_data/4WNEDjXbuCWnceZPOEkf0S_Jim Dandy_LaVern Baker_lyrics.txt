(Ah-ooh
Ah-ooh
Ah-ooh)

Jim Dandy to the rescue
Jim Dandy to the rescue
Jim Dandy to the rescue
Go, Jim Dandy
Go, Jim Dandy

Jim Dandy on a mountain top
30,000 feet to drop
Spied a lady on a runaway horse
Ah-ha, that's right, of course
Jim Dandy to the rescue
Go, Jim Dandy
Go, Jim Dandy

Jim Dandy met a girl named Sue
She was feelin' little kind of blue
Jim Dandy he's the kind of guy
Never liked to see a little girl cry
Jim Dandy to the rescue
Go, Jim Dandy
Go, Jim Dandy
You might also like
Jim Dandy to the rescue
Jim Dandy to the rescue
Jim Dandy to the rescue
Go, Jim Dandy
Go


Jim Dandy in a submarine
Got a message from a mermaid queen
She was hangin from a fishin' line
Jim Dandy didn't waste no time
Jim Dandy to the rescue
Go, Jim Dandy
Go, Jim Dandy

Jim Dandy want to go to Maine
Got a ticket on a DC plane
Jim Dandy didn't need no suit
He was hip and ready to boot
Jim Dandy to the rescue
Go, Jim Dandy
Go, Jim Dandy
Go, go, go, Jim Dandy
Go, go, go, Jim Dandy
Go, go, go, Jim Dandy
Go on, Jim Dandy
Jim Dandy's gone!Embed
