5 ContributorsGreasy Kidâ€™s Stuff Lyrics(Steve Vai)
This is 'greasy kid's stuff,' mix 12, ground zero, with the melody guitars
Up .3, bass up .4, kick down .5, overheads up .4, less gate on the snare
And 3db added at 10k on the pultecs to the rhythm guitars. we're rolling
(Female Voice)
And that's not just greasy kid's stuffYou might also likeEmbed
