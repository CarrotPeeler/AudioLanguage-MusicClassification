3 ContributorsSymbiotic in Theory LyricsUnable to move from a point of view
Driven by reasons as old as time itself
Symbiotic in theory
In order for a life to be
Commanded it must be owned
Symbiotic in theory

To flow downhill
A will is not given
Inferior or superior
Will is that which decides
Gravity forces water
To flow downhill
A will is not given
To give and take, to be
Symbiotic in theory
