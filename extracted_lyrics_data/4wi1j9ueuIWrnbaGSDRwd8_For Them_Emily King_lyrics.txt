4 ContributorsFor Them LyricsLead me to water
Songs of my father
Show me the rhythm
Records in the kitchen
I'll get along, playing my father's songs
Lead me to shelter
Songs of my mother
Show me the meaning
Music and wonder
I'll get along, singing my mother's songs
I want my mother
I want my mother to be happy
I want my mother to be happy, and I'll be
I want my father
I want my father to be happy
I want my father to be happy, and I'll be
In light from the dark, there came a spark
Carried me down with a loving heart
Where do we end
Love never far
Home is all I wanted
Never do we part
