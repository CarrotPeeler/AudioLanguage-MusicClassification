3 ContributorsSweet Release Lyrics
I was born on a side road far from here
While the town was burning out my dark window
I was crowned with a cage of cold barbed wire
And my bottle I keep with me even 'til now

Curse my pain, curse the sunrise every dawn, oh
Oh, those sidewalks ran me ragged, yeah, those cracks my only guide
Long for midnight, long for darkness, sweet release, woah
Beg the alleys for your endless time to cease

Screaming blackbird on my shoulders
Mark my nearness to his youth, oh
Left my senses reeling
As he cried, "I understand you", oh

(Ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah
Sweet release
Ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah
Sweet release)

Try the handle, try the doorway, try the path
Try to enter, to enter and to find some solace there, oh yeah
In this clearing you'll find nothing but a song
Give it breath, give it sunshine, and with you it will belong, oh long

It will whisper, it will stir a gentle breeze
Its hands are your hands, they will take you where you please, if you please
Will you choose to be gentle? It's just your life whatever you feel
Are we blind for a reason or is it just to make it real?  Oh, real

Show me do, give me seashells for my ears
Tell your neighbors and forgive them for their fearsEmbed
