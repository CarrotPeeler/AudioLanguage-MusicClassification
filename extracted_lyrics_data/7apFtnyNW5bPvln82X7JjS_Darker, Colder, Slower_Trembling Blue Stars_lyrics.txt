1 ContributorDarker, Colder, Slower LyricsThe days seem darker now
This sense of winding down
The days seem colder now
This sense of slowing down
When all I knew was your presence
What to do with your absence
When all I knew was your presence
What to do?
Left alone to travel on
Left to grieve silently
I see an open door
I see an empty chair
Someone's left the room
Still something tints the air
I see an open door
I see an empty chair
Someone's left the room
Someone left too soon
Left alone to travel on
Left to grieve silently
Maybe not today
Maybe not tomorrow
But where you've gone
Someday I'll follow
There's never time enough
There's no one who won't leave
A constant slipping away
Nothing's held in place
There's never time enough
There's no one who will stay
To the past each day
The future gives up space
Left alone to travel on
Left to grieve silentlyYou might also likeEmbed
