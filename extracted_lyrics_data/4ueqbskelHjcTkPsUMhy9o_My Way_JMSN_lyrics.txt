8 ContributorsMy Way Lyrics
Theres a million things, a million things
That we'll never understand
Eventually we begin to see
Whats the point in making plans

What I believe may not be right
But that's just the way I live life

I know I made so many mistakes
Most of the time refused to change
But through all the love and all the pain
I did things my way, my way
Ooooh ooh, my way

I've had a thousand dreams, of how i think it should be
But maybe thats just not Gods plan
Honestly, I said honestly, it's made me a stronger man


Sometimes i get stressed about my life
Wondering why i even try
But even if everything's not right
I'm doing it my way
Workin' and workin' day and night
I ain't got the time to be polite
Cause you know that it's my human right
To do things my way
