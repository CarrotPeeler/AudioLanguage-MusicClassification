1 ContributorRatSafari LyricsI believe in my life
Under darkened skies
There's no more time to be forgiven
I just want you to say
It's OK anyway
There's a lot of time to be forgiven
Call of the dogs
We're not wanted
Call of the dog
This place is haunted
Call of the dogs
The rats will be kings instead of us
I was lost out of sight
Now I'm holding the line
I know this phase won't last forever
I believe in my life
Under darkened skies
I hope to leave this stormy weather
Calling me a fool won't help you
You know that I am right
It gets me on the feet to see
You're wrong and down and out
You might also likeWell, I'm alive and I live forever
You all soon must die
Calling me a fool won't help you
You know that I am rightEmbed
