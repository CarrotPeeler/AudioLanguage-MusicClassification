Ooh, baby, I hear how you spend night time
Wrapped like candy in a blue, blue neon glow
Fade away and radiate
Fade away, radiate

Ooh, baby, watchful lines
Vibrate soft in brainwave time
Silver pictures move so slow
Golden tubes faintly glow

Electric faces seem to merge
Hidden voices mock your words
Fade away, radiate
Fade away and radiate

Beams become my dream
My dream is on the screen
The beams become my dream
My dream is on the screen

Dusty frames that still arrive
Die in 1955
Fade away and radiate
Fade away and radiate
You might also like
The beams become my dream
My dream is on the screen

Fade away and radiate
Fade away and radiate
Fade away and radiate
Fade away and radiate
