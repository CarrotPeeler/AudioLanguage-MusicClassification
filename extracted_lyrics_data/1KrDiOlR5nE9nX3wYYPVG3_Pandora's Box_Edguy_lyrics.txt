3 ContributorsPandoraâ€™s Box LyricsGod, oh, please, bear with me
As you're looking from above
Elementary question:
What do you take as love?
Badlands all around me
I got animal inside
God, oh, please, forgive me for my sins
And for I enjoy this ride
Woe to you, o, earth and flood
For the devil sends the beast
Tell your dreamin' son about the rain to come
Make him rescue us by sea
Creeping, crawling on all fours
It's down to push and shove
The juggernaut is full, let's close the doors
And the ride is on
Wastelands are waiting to be found another day
Ride across the ocean, fly by the stars
Pandora's box is under weigh
Turmoil on the pleasure boat
The pigeon can't be seen
Look! the serpent's shape bespeaks:
The problem lies within
You might also likeOn this sea of sadness
Unknown destination sought
But we cross your shady ocean on our yacht
And the ride is on
Wastelands are waiting to be found another day
Ride across the ocean, we fly by the stars
Pandora's box is under weigh
And the ride is on
Ladies are waiting to be found another day
Ride across the ocean, we fly by the stars
Pandora's Box - I'll come inside
When you raised your voice to decide
Who's in and out
Do you know what you've done
And what you let inside
That along the lamb you took the lion too
Now you're looking down at me
In your image I've been created
And along with the right you see
You gotta deal with the left of me now
From my mind to my heart and to my feet
From my head to my toes
And - owing to you - in between
To the holy land? You gotta be dreaming
Territorial mission: we're led by the semen!
Gagagago!

And the ride is on
Wastelands are waiting to be found another day
Ride across the ocean, fly by the stars
Pandora's Box is under weigh
And the ride is on
Ladies are waiting to be found another day
Ride across the ocean, we fly by the stars
Pandora's Box - I'll come inside
And the ride is on
Wastelands are
Ride across the ocean, oh
And the ride is on
Ladies are
Ride acoss the ocean
Pandora's Box is under weighEmbed
