Dear Mrs. Applebee
I gotta get something off my chest
Mrs. Applebee, you've got the wrong idea about me
Mrs. Applebee, you told Marie she couldn't go
With me because you heard that I was bad
Mrs. Applebee, please hear my plea
Don't you know that anyone can change
Mrs. Applebee?
And for Marie I'd even swim the sea Mrs. Applebee
I'm begging you to please be kind I want a chance
To change your mind about me, Mrs. Applebee
Dear Mrs. Applebee
I know that I once made some bad mistakes
Mrs. Applebee
But that was long before I met Marie
Mrs. Applebee, I'll make you glad as you can be
And you'll be proud to see Marie with me
Mrs. Applebee, Mrs. ApplebeeYou might also likeEmbed
