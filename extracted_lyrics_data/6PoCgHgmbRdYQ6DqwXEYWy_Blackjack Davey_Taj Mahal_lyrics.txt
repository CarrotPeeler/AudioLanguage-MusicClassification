Singin' him a song so gayly
Well he played and he sang
'Til the green woods rang
And he charmed the heart of a lady
He charmed the heart of a lady
He charmed the heart of a lady
Oh, won't you come along and be my pretty little missy
Come along and be my lady
She say, Ha! You know I know it's right
I'm gonna sleep on the ground tonight
With my man Blackjack Davey
With my man Blackjack Davey
Oh, with my man Blackjack Davey
Who gonna shoe your pretty little feet now?
Who gonna rub your head?
Who gonna kiss your ruby red lips
When I'm some long distant land, baby
When I'm some long distant land
When I'm a long distant land
She say Papa gonna shoe my pretty little feet now
Sister gonna rub my head
I will live in my mama's house
And I will not need no spouse
When you're in your long distant land, baby
When you're in your long distant land, baby
When you're in your long distant land

He soothed her with his music
He soothed her with his song
He sung 'til he was nearly crazy
She said ha! You know I know it's right
But I'm gonna sleep on the ground tonight
With my man Blackjack Davey
With my man Blackjack Davey
Oh, with my man Blackjack Davey
