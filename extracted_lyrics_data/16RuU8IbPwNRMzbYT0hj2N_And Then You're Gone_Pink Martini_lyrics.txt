2 ContributorsAnd Then Youâ€™re Gone LyricsMy dear Lorenzo you take my hand
And understand the tears that I have cried
We light the candles and pour the wine
And laugh as if you'll never leave my side
You take me in your arms and tell me
That I'll always be the only one
And then you're gone
You come to see me on a Saturday
Presenting peonies knowing just what to say
We dance until the break of dawn
I turn my back and then you're gone
Swirling in a sea of stars
Twirling to the strum of guitars
No one tangos quite the way you do
But now my dancing days with you are through
You think I miss you each time you disappear
Maybe I used to but it's becoming clear
I know your tricks I 've heard your songs
You swear your love and then you're gone
Remember last time it was a perfect day
You took me sailing and then you sailed away
Now here you are outside my door
You want back in just like before
Well save your breath don't make me yawn
You've had your chance now just be goneSee Pink Martini LiveGet tickets as low as $28You might also likeEmbed
