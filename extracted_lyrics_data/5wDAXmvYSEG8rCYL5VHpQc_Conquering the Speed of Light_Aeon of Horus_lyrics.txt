1 ContributorConquering the Speed of Light LyricsThe promise of a future is denied
To inferior genetic spoil
The rapture can only possess the elite
Come forth... to me...
Evolving construct and whisked away its energy field
So I may become the cosmos
Expand
Evolve
Destroy
Come forth take me, embrace me, mighty quantum field
I rule over the erratic
To form neutrino intellectual structures
I smooth over the rents in its space
Above all else I know this
As I conquer the speeds of space
I bleed quantum chaotic neutron fuelled spores
Surpass the rate of light... surpass
Does time itself cease? I question it not
Its matter is the only subject of fiction!
My time is all, as one at once!You might also likeEmbed
