2 ContributorsSorry LyricsRing out my guilt and hang it on the line
It's been raining all week it won't get a chance to dry
I've been lookin' round the pantry for a box of sorries
I'm all run out yeah, I'm all run out aah
It's not that hard to say I know
I'ts not that hard to say I know
It's not that hard to say, so why can't I say it now?
And it's been swellin' up inside like the kitchen sponge
It's in the back of my throat it's on the tip of my tongue
If I could sweep it out the door that would be the end
But this wind keeps blowin' it in again aah
It's not that hard to say I know
It's not that hard to say I know
It's not that hard to say, so why can't I say it now?
Say it now
Say it now
Say it now..
Say it now
Say it now
Say it now..
I've been lockin' all the doors
And drawin' all the blinds
It always seems to find it's way back inside
If I could sweep it out the door that would be the end
But this wind keeps blowin' it in again aah
