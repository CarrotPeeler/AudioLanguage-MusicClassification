7 ContributorsSalute Lyrics
You say you wanna walk away
You ain't got nothing to say
I salute you, yeah
Go on, out the door
Now you take care
No more tears to shed
What, you expecting me to beg?
Well, I'm not, I'm done
So when you leave, just close the door behind you

'Cause, I'm feeling kind of taller than you, lately
I'm feeling kind of stronger than you, oh lately
I'm feeling kind of better than you
And I know just what to do
I feel like doing my hair (My hair)
I feel like calling some of my friends (Some of my girlfriends)
I feel like goin' to a club and partyin'

'Cause I'm a soldier girl, in this world
I stand alone, I can be strong
I walked for miles, I made it home
It's good to know without you, I made it
Soldier girl, in my world
I took the fall, now I stand tall
From the pain and all, I made it through
And now all I gotta say to you
Salute, ay, ay
Salute, ay, ay
You might also like
You think you know everything
And you think that your shâ€” don't stink
Well, it do, hey
And when it comes to me
You don't have a clue
Took me all these years
To realize that you don't belong here
I can do better
You say I'll never do better
Yeah right, whatever

'Cause, I'm feeling kind of taller than you, lately (Oh baby, lately)
I'm feeling kind of stronger than you, oh lately
I'm feeling kind of better than you
And I know just what to do
I feel like doing my hair (My hair)
I feel like calling some of my friends (My girlfriends)
I feel like goin' to a club (Do some partying)

'Cause I'm a soldier girl (Solider girl), in this world (In this world)
I stand alone (Oh), I can be strong (Oh)
I walked for miles (Walked for miles)
I made it home (I made it home)
It's good to know without you, I made it
Soldier girl (Solider girl), in my world (In this world)
I took the fall (Yeah), now I stand tall (Uh-huh)
From the pain and all, I made it through
And now all I gotta say to you
Salute, ay, ay
I say salute, ay, ay
Don't call it a comeback, no
I've been here for years, ha
Through all the drama and the pain
And all the tears
Time to stop this rollercoaster
Say I wanna get off
And start moving mountains, swimming seas
And climbing over walls

'Cause I'm a soldier girl (Solider girl), in this world
I stand alone, I can be strong (Oh)
I walked for miles, I made it home (I salute you)
It's good to know without you, I made it (I salute you)
Soldier girl (Oh), in my world (Oh)
I took the fall (Soldier girl), now I stand tall
From the pain and all (Pain and all)
I made it through (I made it through)
And now all I gotta say to you

I salute you
I salute you
Salute, salute, salute
I salute you
Go on, take care
Go on out the door
Take careEmbed
