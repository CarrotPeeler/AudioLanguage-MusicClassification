1 ContributorUnstoppable Lyrics
There's nothing left for us here
Taken it far as our eyes can see
I'm saying no to the fear
Taking a chance we like what we hear
Skin feels hot to touch, the light is bouncing
Off my face, the rush
And the sun will keep me up, temperature rising
Just can't get enough
And I'm out of control, ready to go
Trust me we're never scared
And I'm giving it all, so just act like you know
Trust me on this, I swear

I'm unstoppable, yeah
Unstoppable
I'm unstoppable, yeah
Unstoppable
I'm unstoppable, yeah
Unstoppable
I'm unstoppable, yeah
Unstoppable

Calling you, I, I, I'm calling you
Calling you, I, I, I'm calling you
Calling you, I, I, I'm calling you
Calling you, I, I, I'm calling you
Calling you, I, I, I'm calling you
Calling you, I, I, I'm calling you
Calling you, I, I, I'm calling you
Calling you, I, I, I'm calling you
You might also like
Sailing through the atmosphere
Chasing the sun when the skies are clear
Programmed to follow my ears
Ready to go, only got one gear
Skin feels hot to touch, the light is bouncing
Off my face, the rush
And the sun will keep me up, temperature rising
Just can't get enough
And I'm out of control, ready to go
Trust me we're never scared
And I'm giving it all, so just act like you know
Trust me on this, I swear


We’re unstoppable, we unstoppable, we unstoppable
We’re unstoppable, we unstoppable, we unstoppable
We’re unstoppable, we unstoppable, we unstoppable
We’re unstoppable, we unstoppable, we unstoppable
