4 ContributorsMemphis Soul Stew Lyrics
Today's special is “Memphis Soul Stew”
We sell so much of this
People wonder what we put in it
We gon' tell you right now

Gimme about a half a teacup of bass
Now, I need a pound of fatback drums
Now, give me four tablespoons of boiling Memphis guitars
This goin' taste all right

Now, just a little pinch of organ
Now, give me a half a pint of horns
Place on the burner and bring to a boil
That's it, that's it, that's it, right there

Now, beat well
