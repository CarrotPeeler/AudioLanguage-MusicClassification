Cause it's about to get out of control
Just one precaution though
There's something you should know
We gotta try to keep it quiet, quiet
Cause what nobody sees
They've no reason to believe
Girl, it should stay between you and me

We should keep it private
Nobody's got to know
Keep this thing on the low
Don't need nobody else
Just you and me invited

No need to shout it out
It's not what its about
If you can keep a secret
We can make it private, private, private
Let's keep it private, private, private
So here's the story now, people are talking loud
And I'm just trying to keep this under control
Girl, here's the bottom line
You can't have love without trust
So girl, let's keep it quiet, quiet
You might also likeCause what nobody sees
They've no reason to believe
Girl, it should stay between you and me

Girl, you better believe
If they try to invade our space
I promise, I swear on my life
Gotta fight to protect this
Forget all the he said, she said
Keep it private

Private, private, private
Let's keep it private, private, privateEmbed
