1 ContributorVancouver Shakedown LyricsWe only came here to play rock'n'roll
Share some times with some people we know
Drink some wine
Give us some time
We ain't no wise boys we ain't no fools
We tried to play clean and keep to the rules
We take and we give, just playin' our gig
But we got laid over
Ya we was done over
Somebody tell us what's goin' down
Don't need another Vancouver shakedown
Six miles high, six miles along
Chasin' the sun we've come to sing you a song
Deliver our goods
We're just rock'n'roll dudes
All these behind us, and one more to go
Fly to Vancouver, to do the last show
It's got to be good
Like we know that it should
But we got laid over
Ya we was done over
You might also likeSomebody tell us what's goin' down
Don't need another Vancouver shakedown
Vancouver shakedown
Vancouver shakedown
We only came here to play rock'n'roll
Share some times with some people we know
Drink some wine
Give us some time
But we got laid over
Ya we was done over
Somebody tell us what's goin' down
Don't need another Vancouver shakedown
Vancouver shakedown
Vancouver shakedown
Vancouver shakedown
Vancouver shakedown
Vancouver shakedown
