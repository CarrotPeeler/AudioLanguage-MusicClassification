7 ContributorsGone Lyrics
Ooh
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh

Can you imagine what it would be like if we never met
We never kissed?
Can you imagine if we never got to spend those nights
In each other's arms?

But I don't know how it feels
But it probably would kill me
Probably would tear me down
So I, I don't think about it
'Cause my heart can't take it
If you were gone

If you were gone, if you were gone
If you were gone, if you were gone
If you were gone, if you were gone
If you were gone, if you were gone

Can you picture yourself
Getting older, dear with someone else? I can't
'Cause I feel like we are the exception to the rule
I know this love is true, and I

Don't know how it feels (Oh-oh)
But it probably would kill me (Yeah-eah)
Probably would tear me down
So I, I don't think about it (I don't)
'Cause my heart can't take it
If you were gone

If you were gone, if you were gone (Hey)
If you were gone, if you were gone
If you were gone (Gone), if you were gone (Gone)
If you were gone, if you were gone

Don't rewind anything
Too excited to see what tomorrow brings, yeah yeah, oh-oh
You changed my world around
And I'm not scared to go falling down in love
What if you were gone?

If you were gone, if you were gone
If you were gone, if you were gone (If you were)
If you were gone (Oh-oh-whoa), if you were gone (You were gone)
If you were gone, if you were gone
If you were (If you were)
If you were (If you were)
If you were gone
If you were (I can't imagine)
If you were (I can't imagine)
If you were gone
If you were gone2Embed
