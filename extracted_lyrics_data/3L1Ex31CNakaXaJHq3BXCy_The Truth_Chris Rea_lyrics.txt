2 ContributorsWhen the Truth Comes Out LyricsThat thing you do, always trying to hide
Always shows trough, we all know you lied
You smile so sweet, singing your song
But you know what you done
What you done was wrong
You will scream for mercy
There is no doubt
You'll go down for good
When the truth comes out
I can hear that final whistle blow
I can see your face turn red
I can see you try so hard to hide
From everything you said
And in the dark of night you'll know
A sea of tears and pain
You will choke upon the heart you broke
And you will never smile again
You will scream for mercy
There is no doubt
You'll go down for good
When the truth comes outYou might also likeEmbed
