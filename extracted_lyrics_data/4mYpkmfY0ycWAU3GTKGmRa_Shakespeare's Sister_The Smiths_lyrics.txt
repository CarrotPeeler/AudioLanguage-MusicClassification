Young bones groan and the rocks below say
"Throw your skinny body down, son"
But I'm going to meet the one I love
So, please don't stand in my way
Because I'm going to meet the one I love
No, Mamma, let me go

Young bones groan and the rocks below say
"Throw your white body down"
But I'm going to meet the one I love
At last, at last, at last
I'm going to meet the one I love, la-de-da, la-de-da
No, Mamma, let me go

I thought that if you had an acoustic guitar
Then it meant that you were a protest singer
Oh, I can smile about it now but at the time, it was terrible
No, Mamma, let me go
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, noYou might also like5Embed
