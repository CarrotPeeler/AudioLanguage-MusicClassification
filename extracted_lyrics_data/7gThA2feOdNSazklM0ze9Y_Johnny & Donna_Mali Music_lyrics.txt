3 ContributorsJohnny & Donna LyricsJohnny met Donna and they fell in love
But had no idea what love really was
But they tried their best
To make each other smile
But while learning themselves
They would have a child
But with no time to think the whole thing through
Little time to prepare
It got tough to provide for him
And give him love and care
How, how, how, how
How do I when and where?
Are questions that both often ask God
Life is full of twist, twist
Life is full of twirl, twirl, ta-twirl ,twirls
Twirls it's the way of the world that flips you upside down
When you're young when you're old
It just spins out of control, whoa
It spins out of control
So, hold on
Because you never know
Johnny and Donna slowly recognized
That for the baby's future
They planned 2 different lives
Donna wanted a family
She wanted to do it right
Make Johnny's house a home
She wanted to be a wife

And he had to move around
Yeah, he'd be there for his child
But wouldn't settle down
How, how, how, how
How do I when and where?
Are questions they both often asked God
Life is full of twist, twist
Life is full of twirl, twirl, ta-twirl, twirls
Twirls it's the way of the world
It's whirlwinds and girlfriends
Toys and boyfriend, friend, friends
And Frenchmen
War, peace, impeachment, gentlemen
Ladies, Sunday, shady mistakes and peach rings
Blacks and bleach stains
Don't forget wasps and beestings
Whether you're Johnny and Donna
Or neither of the two
Just try to make the best of what's given to youEmbed
