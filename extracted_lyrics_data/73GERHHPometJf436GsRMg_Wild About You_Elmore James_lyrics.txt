1 ContributorWild About You Baby LyricsYes I'm wild about you woman
But you don't treat me right
Yes I'm wild about you baby
But you just treat me right
Well you leave home early in the morning
And you stays out all the night
Well you leave me baby
And you stay away all day long
Well you leave me baby
And you stays out all day long
You leave me weeping and cryin' now darling
And I hope you come back home
You leave me baby
And you know you done me wrong
You leave me darling
And you know you done me wrong
Well I'm down on my pillow
Hoping my baby'd come back home
Well now good bye baby I hope I never see you anymore
Now good bye baby I hope I never see you anymore
Cause started doing me wrong
Like the girl I had before

Hold up my right hand
Now baby
I gotta hold up my right hand
I gotta find me another woman
And I hope you can find your manEmbed
