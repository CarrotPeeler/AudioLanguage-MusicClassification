3 ContributorsMore Than You Know LyricsMore than you know, more than you know
Girl of my heart, I love you so
Lately I find you're on my mind, more than you know
Whether you're right, whether you're wrong
Girl of my heart, I'll string along
You need me so, more than you'll ever know
Loving you the way that I do
There's nothing I can do about it
Loving maybe all you can give
But honey, I can't live without it
Oh, how I'd cry, oh, how I'd cry
If you got tired and said goodbye
More than I'd show, more than you'll ever know
Loving you the way that I do
There's nothing I can do about it
Loving maybe all you can give
But honey, I can't live without it
Oh, how I cry, oh, how I cry
If you got tired and said goodbye
More than I chose, more than you'll ever know
More than you'll ever knowYou might also likeEmbed
