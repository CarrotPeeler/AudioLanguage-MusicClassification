7 ContributorsThe First Deadly Sin Lyrics
Step inside the circle of fire
Flames of desire enlighten the night
Follow your instinct
Burn and writhe in ecstasy

Love will turn to hate
Heat will turn to ice
There is nothing in between
The First Deadly Sin

Ancient taboo takes control
The demon eve possesses your soul
Ridin' high above the flames
You will step into hell

Love will turn to hate
Heat will turn to ice
There is nothing in between
The first deadly sin

Dwell in passionate evil
Forbidden fruits of lust
Embrace and kiss the face of death
It's your first deadly sin

Love will turn to hate
Heat will turn to ice
There's nothing in between
The first deadly sinEmbed
