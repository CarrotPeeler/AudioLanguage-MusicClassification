I could see, everybody's baby, but I couldn't see mine
I could see, the ships pullin' in, to the harbor
I could see the people, meetin' their loved one
Shakin' hand, I sat there
So all alone, coverin' the waterfront
And after a while, all the people
Left the harbor, and headed for their destination
All the ships, left the harbor
And headed for their next destination
I sat there, coverin' the waterfront
And after a while, I looked down the ocean
As far as I could see, in the fog, I saw a ship
It headed, this way, comin' out the foam
It must be my baby, comin' down
And after a while, the ship pulled into the harbor
Rollin' slow, so cripple
And my baby, stepped off board
I was still, coverin' the waterfront
Said "Johnny, our ship had trouble, with the fog
And that's why we're so late, so late
Comin' home, comin' down'You might also likeEmbed
