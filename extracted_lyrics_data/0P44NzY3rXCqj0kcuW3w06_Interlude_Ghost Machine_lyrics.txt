5 ContributorsRich (Interlude) Lyrics
Rich Porter gettin' killed, I remember the day
I remember Rich, man, his leg was shakin', like, like
Like it was a set up for him
Fuck was goin' on? And then, the phone rung
And he told me, like, "Yo, come in", and he was talkin'
And he was sayin', like, "Yo, we got your brother, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah
Nigga, we want, half a million, bam, boom, boom"
Rich was like, "Man, I ain't givin' you shit, or whatever, I ain't got it, man"
And they hung up
And Rich was like, "Yo, you heard that voice?"
And I was like, "I don't know who the fuck that is"
Rich bein' Rich, he mad and, he really wanna find who, you know, who the fuck it is behind this
When they call back, they say, you know, "The thing is gonna be this
You think we playin'? Whatever, whatever, go to McDonald's, on 125th Street
Motherfucker, there's a package there for you in the bathroom"
So Rich sends somebody over there, I believe
They came back, I think, with a coffee can, with Rich' lil' brother finger
And a tape recorder with his lil' brother cryin', pleadin' for his life
I felt right then that it was somebody in the inner circle
Yeah, because they know exactly, every move, you understand?
And which we find later on it was Rich' uncle
That's how wicked, and how deep the game is, broYou might also like1Embed
