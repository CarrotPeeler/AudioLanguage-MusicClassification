2 ContributorsAcid Reflex Lyrics
Hard truth soldier music, hard truth over music
Exposed so the youth can use it
Guerrilla Funk don't confuse it
With off-brand gangster rap that don't do shit
P-Dog and I'm back with a new clique
Sharpshooters, four deep in a 'lark shooters
That might creep in dark and shoot the police
In the heart for Sean Bell and Martin Luther
Cause ever since '90
America tried to bling me, but they still can't blind me
Eighteen years behind me, twenty mo' left
Pro-left, pro-death, the Bush Killa
Corporate conservative crook killer
Wolfowitz for the chips that he took killer
This industry is full of shook niggas
That's why the shame grip breaker returns to left hook niggas

Now when we say Guerrilla Funk
We don't mean monkeys on a vine
We mean this as in New Orleans
Virginia Tech and Columbine

We still rise like gas prices
On fire like CNN satellite vans if they pass by us
Like Bechtel hush money cash stipends
Lindsay Lohan's nose and vagina
Fuck Imus
Then again white folks pointin' fingers at the hate that hate made is timeless
Look at Hussein, paid 'em, trained 'em
Played 'em, called 'em "al-Qaeda" then hanged 'em
You said die nigga? But I'm still crackin'
Like six out of twenty nine eleven hijackers
If anybody dead, it's kids in the black church
Being mislead by the misled
B-E-T, telling kids get bread
But never telling 'em what to do with bread
A project for the bitch scared
Joe Biden running blue but he just might drip red
You might also like
Now when we say Guerrilla Funk
We don't mean monkeys on a vine
We mean this as in New Orleans
Virginia Tech and Columbine
O.J. Simpson, B.T.K
Beltway, Peterson, Jon Benet
The San Francisco Panther 8
Our government's hate for foreign kind

Representing for the innocent victims out in Darfur
But it's really not our war
I'ma leave it alone on this track cause that's something
I had to go and write to a whole 'nother song for
The rap shit got niggas on all fours
T-K.A.S.H. make many sound like Forrest
Guerrilla Funk, straight vets, place bets them
Pseudo-ass revolutionaries never come towards us
By the way, if you ain't spittin' hard truth
Then you ain't spittin' shit up in our booth
Grande mocha civil rights leaders get a
Blue star mama tryin' to walk up in our shoes
Guerrilla Funk dot com is the website
Log on, get'cha head right
We got pro-red right scared to head to bed at night
Hard Truth won't spare ya life motherfucker
Now when we say Guerrilla Funk
We don't mean monkeys on a vine
We mean this as in New Orleans
Virginia Tech and Columbine
O.J. Simpson, B.T.K
Beltway, Peterson, Jon Benet
The San Francisco Panther 8
Our government's hate for foreign kind

What is a revolution? Was no love lost, was no compromise, was no negotiation, I'm tellin' you you don't know what a revolution is! Because when you find out what it is you'll get out of the way. You haven't got a revolution that doesn't involve bloodshed
And you're afraid to bleed, I saw it, you're afraid to bleed
If it is right, for America to draft us and teach us how to be violent, then it is right for you and me

We don't talk about, we do it
Got no time to dance, it's the movement
Comin' way too strong, let's move it
Freedom must be won, or lose it

Who said freedom could never be won?
Who said it was the ballot or the gun?
Who said a group like us, couldn't move?
It wasn't me, but maybe it was you
