8 ContributorsCalling All the Heroes LyricsWe left you in pastures rarely seen holding out the fortress for a while
Everyone knew why the calm had been, keeping friends among you saves a fight
In the dead of the night there was movement and shadows
Attacking the women and taking the gold
The men were away and no one could hear them
They still cry today when the story is told
High on a mountain out searching for gold
Men have had warning of scriptures fortold
Turn around and fight for freedom you can hear the people screaming
Calling all the heroes, they're shooting up the town boys
The men returned to find their home destroyed, people rushing round with scars of war
Babies crying the aged wounded mourned, calling out for someone to hear their prayers
Five miles away were the theives and the bandits
Laughing and joking sickly and crude
They didn't know that the men had come back home
They didn't know they were being persued
High on a mountain the men looked below
Cooked up a plan that would outwit their foe
They scrambled down the mountain shooting reclaimed all the bandits looted
Calling all the heroes they're shooting up the town boysYou might also likeEmbed
