Me an my baby we do alright
No leaves on the trees
Few birds and no bees
That's alright by me
I've got everything I need
Come February looking forward to
Valentines Day
When I get that card from my baby
And here's what she's sayin
Honey that's alright by me
I've got everything I need
I can't wait till June
To celebrate our honeymoon
Springtime is the right time
Nothing else compares
To seeing you with flowers in your hair
In the summertime when It's hot an sticky
You know stayin cool gets to be
Just a little bit tricky
She gets her feather fan
Then she lays back down
An that's alright by me
I've got everything I needYou might also likeEmbed
