For sentimental reasons
I hope you do believe me
I'll give you my heart
I love you
And you alone were meant for me
Please give your loving heart to me
And say we'll never part
I think of you every morning
Dream of you every night
Darling, I'm never lonely
Whenever you're in sight
Je t'aime toi
Pour raisons sentimentales
J'espère que tu me crois
Je t'ai donné mon cœur
I love you
For sentimental reasons
I hope you do believe me
I've given you my heart
I hope you do believe me
I've given you my heartYou might also likeEmbed
