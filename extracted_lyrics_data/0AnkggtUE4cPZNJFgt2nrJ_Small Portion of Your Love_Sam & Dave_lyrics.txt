Just a small portion of your love, I'm like a river a-runnin' never stop
Oh, just a little bit goes a long way
Just as long as I get a little, each and every day
Just a small portion of your love seems to rule my troubles away
Just a small portion of your love and I'll go to work all for no pay
Oh, your love that's so fine and oh how it soothe my time
But goin' out, get you, give me peace of mind
Ooo baby, you don't know what you do for me
Ooo baby, I don't have no misery
Just a small portion of your love, just a small portion of your love
Ooo baby, you don't know what you do for me
Ooo baby, I don't have no misery
Just a small portion of your love, that's all I'll ever need
Just a small portion of your love, just a teeny weeny bit
Just a small portion of your loveYou might also likeEmbed
