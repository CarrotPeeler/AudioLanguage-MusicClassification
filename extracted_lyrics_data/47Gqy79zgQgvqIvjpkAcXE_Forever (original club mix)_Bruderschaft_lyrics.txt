22 ContributorsForever (Original Club Mix) Lyrics
I don't believe in the existence of mercy's guiding hand
Not with all that I have witnessed
I cannot understand
Forever burdened with the knowledge
That I could have been so much more
When the truth is hard to suffer
I knew this all before
There is no comfort in faith
The heavens still will fall
A thousand towers rise before me
And I cannot climb them all
There is no kind of joy in this
There is no time that it can heal
When emptiness enshadows bliss
There is nothing left to feel
I have not abandoned hope
Though I know there's nothing more
Tired and alone, you forget what you have hoped for

I will walk this ground forever
And stand guard against your name
I will give all I can offer
I will shoulder all the blame
I am sentry to you now
All your hopes and all your dreams
I will hold you to the light
That's what forever means
You might also like
I was never what you wanted
I could never never please
I swallowed all our sorrow
In the midst of my disease
All my fortunes, all my gains
All the battles I have won...
Now collapsing like the rain
I stand alone, your only son...
Take some solace in these words
Take notice of this place
Hollow whispers that they are
Like the wind upon my face
Just sing softly in my ear
And look at me with wonder
I will try to ease your fear
As the darkness pulls you under

I will walk this ground forever
And stand guard against your name
I will give all I can offer
I will shoulder all the blame
I am sentry to you now
All your hopes and all your dreams
I will hold you to the light
That's what forever meansEmbed
