You can't fight the feeling
And all is the same
And the pouring rain, y'know, y'know
Is coming out of the ceiling
Falling from above
Falling in and out of love
A broken heart is still beating
In and out of time
Hold your body next to mine, y'know, y'know
But you can't stop the bleeding
Sing to yourself and hold on
'Cause everybody's on the run
Everybody's on the run

Hang in there, love, you've gotta hold on
Hang in there, love, you've gotta hold on
'Cause everybody's on the run
Everybody's on the run
Everybody's on the run
Everybody's on the run

You've been drifting and stealing
Trying to walk in my shoes
But they don't belong to you, you know they don't
But you can't find the meaning
Sing to yourself and hold on
'Cause everybody's on the run
Everybody's on the run
You might also like
Hang in there, love, you've gotta hold on
Hang in there, love, you've gotta hold on
'Cause everybody's on the run
Hang in there, love, you've gotta hold on
Hang in there, love, you've gotta hold on
'Cause everybody's on the run
Everybody's on the run
Everybody's on the run
Everybody's on the run

Hang in there, love, you've got to hold on
You got to be strong enough for love, y'know, y'know
Hang in there, love, you've got to hold on
You got to be strong enough for love, y'know, y'know
Hang in there, love, you've got to hold on
You got to be strong enough for love, y'know, y'know
Hang in there, love, you've got to hold on
You got to be strong enough for love, y'know, y'know
Hang in there, love, you've got to hold on
'Cause everybody's on the run
Everybody's on the run
Everybody's on the run
Everybody's on the run2Embed
