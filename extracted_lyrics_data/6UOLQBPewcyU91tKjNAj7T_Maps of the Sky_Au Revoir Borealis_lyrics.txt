1 ContributorMaps of the Sky LyricsCan you reach me
Will you bring me
Full circle
From the outside
Pulling inward
Full circle
The infinite depth
And chorus of light
The anchoring earth
And the width of the night
How silent their song
In circling arcs
And weight of the air
Its lights through the dark
Turning to make
The symbols and shapes
Of ages past
That show us the way
...to home
The compass' course
In the wake of true north
Shows us our passage
In spheres and lines

And our lights in the dark
Moving silent and small
Across the snow...Embed
