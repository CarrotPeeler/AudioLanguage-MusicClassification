7 ContributorsHuff + Puff Lyrics
We're gonna huff and puff and blow the house down
Tunacome na mastyles hazijaonekana (aha)
Chukua dakika kama tano uite mazimamoto
Ju tumeshika nare
Wakichelewa watapata ju ni moshi imebaki
Ju maji haitoshi kuzima hii beat so smooth
Oh so nice, play it twice, have a good time

Are you ready to disco?
You've gotta give me something and
I'll give you something back
Are you ready to disco?
You've gotta give me something and
I'll give you something back

Give me five, it's good to be alive
The sky, it seems so far away
But we know that we've been to the moon and back
And we're sure that nothing's gonna hold us back
Take it easy, mse shika ndizi
Ye yadu mi chizi, wacha nitulize
Nimejaa points kama porcupine
I need to keep my mind (mind) occupied
You might also like
Are you ready to disco?
You've gotta give me something and
I'll give you something back
Are you ready to disco?
You've gotta give me something and
I'll give you something back

Oh so nice, play it twice
Oh so nice, play it twice
Oh so nice, play it twice

We're gonna huff and puff and blow the house down
Tunacome na mastyles hazijaonekana (aha)
Chukua dakika kama tano uite mazimamoto
Ju tumeshika nare
Wakichelewa watapata ju ni moshi imebaki
Ju maji haitoshi kuzima hii beat so smooth
Oh so nice, play it twice (twice, twice), have a good time
Have a good time
Oh so nice, play it twice
Have a good time
Are you ready to disco?
You've gotta give me something and
I'll give you something back
Are you ready to disco?
You've gotta give me something and
I'll give you something backEmbed
