5 ContributorsThe Garden of Everything Lyrics
Here you are
Daylight's star
Made out of miracles
Perfection
Of your own
You alone
Oh so incredible
Each atom
Sings to me
Set me free
From chains of the physical
Oh free me, Oh free me
The mirror melts
I'm somewhere else
Inside eternity
Where you on
Outstretched wings
Sing within
The Garden of Everything
Where memories
Call to me
Backward dreams?
Or phantom reality?
You might also likeCall to me, they call to me
And so here we are
Lovers of Lost Dimensions
Burning supernovas of all sound and sight
Every touch, a temptation
And for every sense, a sensation
(Uta ha    ima kaze ni notte
Haruka tooi    anata no moto he
Itsuka sora ha    hitotsu ni tsunagaru
Watatte yukeru    anata no moto he)
Eyes of pure
Deep azure
Quite unbelievable
The sun's daughter
You've been made
Not to fade
Quite inconceivable
Each atom sings to me
Set me free
From chains of the physical
Oh free me, Oh free me
A love like ours
A starry flower
Through seasons and centuries
As rivers reach the sea
You'll reach me
With songs of your symmetry
A small boat
There will float
To far off coasts
The Isle of Infinity
Come with me, Oh come with me
Here we'll see
Love's lost tree
Made out of miracles
Emotions, crystal leaves
To cover me
And you in eternity
Each atom sings to us
Through the blood
"Love is a miracle"
Sings softly, it sings softly
And so here we are
Lovers of Lost Dimensions
Burning supernovas of all sound and sight
Every touch, a temptation
And for every sense, a sensation
(Uta ha ima kaze ni notte
Haruka tooi anata no moto he
Itsuka sora ha hitotsu ni tsunagaru
Watatte yukeru anata no moto he)
And so here we are
Twin stars of brilliant brightness
Lanterns lit by life
For all the depths of night
And every day will return us
To arms of the ever eternal
(Uta ha    ima kaze ni notte
Haruka tooi    anata no moto he
Itsuka sora ha    hitotsu ni tsunagaru
Watatte yukeru    anata no moto he)
So here we are
Lovers of Lost Dimensions
Burning supernovas of all sound and sight
And every day will return us
To arms of the ever eternal
(Uta ha ima kaze ni notte
Haruka tooi anata no moto he
Itsuka sora ha hitotsu ni tsunagaru
Watatte yukeru anata no moto he)
Here we are
(Here we are)
Uhhhhhh uhhhhhh
Lovers of lost dimensions
And every day will return us
To arms of the ever eternalEmbed
