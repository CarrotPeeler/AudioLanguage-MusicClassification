13 ContributorsLiar Lyrics
Huh! Huh!

Betty's got the back of her dress all ripped out
Mama's got her face muffled, twist and shout
Ah, you're a liar

Liar, liar, you got your pants on fire
Liar, liar, hanging by the telephone wire
You know, you're a goddamn motherfucking liar
You know you are, alright

You profit from the lie, you profit from the lie, yeah
You profit from the lie, you profit from the lie
You profit from the lie, you profit from the lie, yeah
You profit from the rape lie, baby

Eat meat
Hate blacks
Beat your fuckin' wife
It's all the same thing
You might also like
Deny
You live your life in denial, baby
You stand my life on trial
You, you, always deny me

You profit from the lie, you profit from the lie
You profit from the lie, you profit from the lie, yeah
You profit from the lie, you profit from the lie
You profit from the lie, you profit from the lie

All we are saying (Ah! Ah!)
Is, "Give peace a chance," (Ah! Ah!)
All we are saying (Ah! Ah!)
Is, "Give peace a chance," (Ah!)
Huh! Huh!

Betty's got the back of her dress all ripped out
Mama's got her face muffled and twist and shout and twist and shout
And twist and twist and twist and twist and twist and fuckin' shout it
You're, you're, you're a liar, liar

Liar, liar, you got your pants on fire
Liar, liar, hanging by the telephone wire
You know, you're a goddamn motherfucking liar
You know you are, alright1Embed
