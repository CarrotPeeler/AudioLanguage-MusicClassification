3 ContributorsLiving Wild Freestyle Lyrics
Free the team, 25's finest man
Free Bundles, Free Ping
Free Jack, Free Lilz
Free my fucking nigga Ling man

On my Lil Big Meech, shit I don't sleep shit
Gotta go hard, so my nieces don't need shit
Water round my neck, make a nigga feel seasick
Money turn you blind, certain times you can't see shit
I pull up in a Audi, leave your baby mum speechless
Before I sold grub, how they hell are man eating
I was outside shit, you was probably sleeping
Gave a man a sample, came back and said he's tweaking
Line blowing off in the record label meeting
Still ain't making sense what the record labels speaking
Pedal to the metal foot down you know I'm speeding
I ain't seen my mum in 10 years can you bеlieve it
Growing up I seen nice things and I’ll teef
Living with my auntiе and I never told my teachers
Now I'm on a radio, rap, trap ratio
Rose gold cuban link almost cost a slate of snow
And all my killys making dough
Bagging up flake and crow, steady on paper flow
Pissed that my days were slow
Told that Bitch change her tone
And I ain’t even in changed my clothes
Me and cuzzy weighing O’s
Regardless what way it goes, SMB laying low
My aunt said she’s praying loads
Gave my niggas 39 years shit I hate parole
Life always takes a toll, hopefully I make it though
And I could never hate on bro
He told me how to save my dough, even when the days were slow
Still got my chains on show
Rest in peace uncle Elz
Shit make my stomach curl, and that’s just another L
Most my niggas stuck in jail, remember how it used to be
Millionaire, soon to be, used to shot food for free
Now it’s straight Louis V, all I need is two of me
I used to grab two and three
And now I need half a brick, that was just a starter kit
Cameras when I park the whip
Come up off a telephone, I seen a nigga sell his phone
And hit me up for 7 bones
Never under pressure, no I tell skilly let it go
I’m always in a different ride, grateful that I’m still alive
Used to have a dinger Typh
Ruby cost like 65, love my brothers Trizz and Ice
Men lie women lie
My nigga Ling did his time and came home committing crime
Left him with the biggest bine, tell you about slick and slime
How to build a kicking line, finger on her knicker line
I crashed it from my niggas ride and bro said I did him nice
He ain’t seen a bigger slice
Told her I’m the winning type, not the type to sit inside
Press gas the biggest rides, different from these silly guys
Hate to see my siblings cry
I see my old nig inside pissed to see me in my prime
Young nigga living fine, imagine if I didn’t grind
Bad bitches in the line
Always got my hoodie on, and I ain’t even fully gone
Feeling like I’m in the cloud, mummy said I’m living wild
Yungen but I been about, never really seen a drought
Missus said I’m in and out, she just wants the best for me
Sharon used to test the B, feds still stressing me
Gods still blessing me, give thanks separately
My darg got 23, used to make plenty p
Said it’s what it’s meant to be, he just leave the rest to me
My life’s still tester, GYou might also like1Embed
