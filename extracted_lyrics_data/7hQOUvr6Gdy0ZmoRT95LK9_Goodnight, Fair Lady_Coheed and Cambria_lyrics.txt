13 ContributorsGoodnight, Fair Lady Lyrics
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen
I have a story to tell you of one slow decline
Where a girl yanked on the strings
To break this man's heart
Oh lord, I think I deserve
A little better than this, I think I've earned it
So, I'll just keep humming this song
And hope you follow

Turn me over, roll me 'round
To find the truth that I don't want found
Oh, don't believe everything you hear
I'm the snake waiting for you, dear
And eventually, you'll come to me
I know you will
Oh, I know you will

Your lipstick crazy, I make my pass
The drink turns over, the glass smashed
And with the kindness of my smarts
I replace your pleasure with a friend at the bottom

Turn me over, roll me 'round
To find the truth that I don't want found
Oh, don't believe everything you hear
I'm the snake waiting for you, dear
And eventually, you'll come to me
I know you will
You might also like
Oh, it's my fate
To be your biggest mistake, oh, oh
Oh, I'll tell you all you want to hear
Until you sleep

I know you will...
Oh, goodnight, oh, goodnight
Fair lady

Oh, turn me over, roll me 'round
To find the truth that I don't want found
Oh, don't believe everything you hear
I'm the snake waiting for you, dear
And eventually, you'll come to me
Eventually, you'll come to me

We can agree to disagree
Well, maybe that was you then, and now this is me
But eventually, you'll come to me, baby
I know you will...
