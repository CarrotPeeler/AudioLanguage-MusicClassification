1 ContributorLast Night On Earth LyricsGetting closer to the final frontier
We've reached the point of no return
The beast is hungry it wants more
Everyday I see it everywhere
The hatred senseless violence
Consuming our precious souls
There's no more sense in anything
Humanity's limping to its grave
What if everything would change and we would build a better world
Would you call that utopia, would you call that Paradise?
Yes, the answer lies in questions that are simple but so true
What would you do... if it's your last night on earth?
What if everything would change and we would build a better world
Would you call that utopia, would you call that Paradise?
Yes, the answer lies in questions that are simple but so true
What would you do?
What if everything would change and we would build a better world
Would you call that utopia, would you call that Paradise?
Yes, the answer lies in questions that are simple but so true
What would you do... if it's your last night on earth?You might also likeEmbed
