Nobody knows except my pillow at night
All through the day how many tears I have to fight

And oh, when I'm alone, yeah
I just cry like a baby
I cry like a baby
Oh, oh (I cry)
Oh-oh (I cry), yeah

Nobody sees except my mirror on the wall
I'm not the fairest, I'm the bluest of them all

And, oh-oh, when I'm alone, yeah
I just cry like a baby
I cry like a baby
Oh-oh (I cry)
Oh-oh (I cry), yeah

Each day I say, "Tomorrow will be my lucky day"
Ah-ha, yeah
And my pillow will be surprised when I come home with glad eyes
And the mirror on the wall will see that I'm happiest of them all, ooh, ooh
You might also like
No more nights staring at that empty chair
Because I know that you'll be sitting there

And oh-oh, when I'm alone, yeah
I won't cry like a baby
Cry like a baby
Oh yeah (I cry)
Said I won't cry (I cry), no

I won't cry like a baby (Cry like a baby)
Woo-hoo (I cry), no
Whoa-whoa (I cry), yeah
I won't (Cry like a baby)
Tell 'em for me again (Cry like a baby)
I said that I (I cry)
No, I won't cry (I cry)Embed
