1 ContributorOnly Fools Wish For Love Lyrics
If everything you said were true
Rest assured I’d vouch for you
But your prophecies turned sour and blue
No flowers, no moon
I have possibly turned my back on real words
In the real world

We’ll never be young and soft
Only fools wish for love

A new wrinkle before the dawn
It wriggles on my forehead
Your magic wand up in my face
Is it tails or heads?
Is it infinity, will you reach before me?
Want you to fly with me

We’ll never be young and soft
Only fools wish for love
Only I wish for you

S.O.S. I write in the sand
You’re far too easy on me
It’s a risk, I like the suspense
Rewards the fool in me
S.O.S. I write in the sand
You’re far too easy on me
It’s a risk, I like the suspense
Rewards the fool in me
You might also like
We’ll never be young and soft
Only fools wish for loveEmbed
