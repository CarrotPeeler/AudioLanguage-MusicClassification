Daddy never live
The same life I be living
Right now
I was on your lane
Till u sidetalks
So I switch lane
Ice T all white cocaine
Lucifer my daddy
Jezebel my mommy
Came in with alot troops
6 with tigers 10 with a wolf
Other with a shovel and glove
Bad man got scared did a peace sign
So he could get a peace of mind
Shawty thought she saw that on a movie
So she call the pizza man ,pizza man,turn
To a real man 
Hit it from the back like a real man
