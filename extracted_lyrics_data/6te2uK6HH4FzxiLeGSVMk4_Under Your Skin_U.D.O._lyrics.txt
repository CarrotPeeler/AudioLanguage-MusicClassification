I Hate The Way – How You Look
You’re Telling Lies – Of Your Life
Don’t Forget I Have The Book
You Always Talk – With Two Faces
I Always Had The Solid Truth
You Are A Rip Off And A Liar
What Did You Do With All The Loot
Your Stories Have Been Blown To Pieces
You’re Not Protected Anymore
All You Think About Is Ego
You Are Rotten To The Core
I’m Like A Needle – Under Your Skin
I’m Your Parasite – Under Your Skin
Like A Needle – Under Your Skin
With All My Might
How Did The Cheating Come So Easy
How Can You Sleep With All The Lies
How Did You Fool All Those People
You Are Jekyll And Hyde
Your Stories Have Been Blown To Pieces
You’re Not Protected Anymore
All You Think About Is Ego
You Are Rotten To The Core

I’m Like A Needle – Under Your Skin
I’m Your Parasite – Under Your Skin
