3 ContributorsThe Day the Earth Caught Fire LyricsAt the first stroke it will be there o’clock precisely
The day the earth caught fire
We stod outside the world was laughing
And the city square
The cast umbrellas to the sky
The sun above my head was burning greedy red
The horns began to blow three cheers for Jericho
The first evacuee
I was headed for the sea I saw them
The roadside refugees
The boys with bloody knees who waved
Abandoned cars that lay too tired to drive away
A world in flames today was all the papers had to say
Run for your life the earth’s caught fire
Run for your life the earth’s caught fire
Run, run, run
The earth’s on fire....ooh
The streetcar prophet said
You tought that God was dead I warned you
The sinners and the saved
They fell down to their knees and prayed
Believers held their breath and stoned a witch to death
The leaders and the led said Blow the bloody Reds away...oh yeah

You better run...oh yeah
Run for your life...your life
The earth’s on fire...ooh
Run for your life the earth’s caught fire
Run for your life the earth’s caught fire
Run, run, run

Run for your life
Run for your life the earth’s caught fire
