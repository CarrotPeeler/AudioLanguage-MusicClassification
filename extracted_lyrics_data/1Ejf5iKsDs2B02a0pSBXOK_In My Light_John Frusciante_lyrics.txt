5 ContributorsIn My Light LyricsHow do you walk through my wall of sleep
I see you in my head but you're right out of reach
And you are the backbone I grind with my teeth
Looking at life from just underneath a now
I see the sun looking down at me
I'm in my light
I can't read the signs
I've shrunk in size
I'm a weakling
I'm the weak link
I'd be your guide but I'm not seeing
I'm not seeing
You are the watcher of thought
You've gotta suffer till you kill the killer
  How can one drowning man save another?
Watching clouds covering the sky you cannot see unless you
Uncover the coverer
 The world is there but can you see through it?
You are the watcher of thought
You've gotta suffer till you slay the slayer
 A focused mind is the key to it, focus you can see through it
Watching clouds covering the sky you cannot see till you
Uncover the coverer

You are the watcher of thoughtYou might also likeEmbed
