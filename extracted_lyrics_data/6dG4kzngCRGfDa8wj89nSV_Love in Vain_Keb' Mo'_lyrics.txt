4 ContributorsLove in Vain LyricsAnd I followed her to the station
With her suitcase in my hand
Woh I followed her to the station
With her suitcase in my hand
You know it's hard to tell, it's hard to tell
When all your love's in vain, all my love's in vain
When the train rolled in to the station
I looked her stright in the eye, yeah
Oh the train rolled in to the station, yes it did
I looked her straight in the eye
You know I felt so lonesome
I felt so lonesome
All I could do is cry
All my love's in vain
And the train left the station
There was two lights on behind
Yeah yeah train left the station
Oh Lord there was two lights on behind
You know the blue light it was my blue
Red light it was my mind
