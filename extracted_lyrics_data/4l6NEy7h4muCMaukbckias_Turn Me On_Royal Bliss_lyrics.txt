1 ContributorTurn me on LyricsDevil woman
There's no need to play these games
I know what things you can do to me
Wanna pop your Daisy Chain
Yeah, I feel that my head's on fire
Well, come, baby, put it out
Why pretend?
I don't wanna be friends
It's not what I came for
You turn me on
Devil woman
I know that you feel the same
And though I lay here beside you
You always gonna be his slave
I feel that my head's on fire
Well, come, baby, put it out
Why pretend?
I don't wanna be friends
It's not what I came for
You turn me on
Why pretend?
I don't wanna be friends
It's not what I came for
You turn me on
You turn me on
Turn me on

It's not what I came for
You turn me on
Why pretend?
I don't wanna be friends
It's not what I came for
You turn me on
You turn me on
You turn me on
You turn me on. (Yeah.)Embed
