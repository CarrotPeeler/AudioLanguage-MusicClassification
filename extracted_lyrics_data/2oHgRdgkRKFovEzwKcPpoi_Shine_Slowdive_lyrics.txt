So my thoughts won't
Have to fight
For your love
Just to see you in me
Hurts too much
Mind fills with the thought
Love you till I caught
Fish in the sky
Impossible to fly
See you walk away
Why can't you stay and
Shine through the light
So my thoughts won't
Have to fight
For your love
Just to see you in me
Hurts too much
High from above
I see the words of love
Decay to the ground
