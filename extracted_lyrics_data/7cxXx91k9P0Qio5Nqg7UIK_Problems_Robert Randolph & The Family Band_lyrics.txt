2 ContributorsProblems LyricsWhen I was a little boy
My mama told me
To play with toys
Now that I am a man
I've grown and learned
To understand
She always kept telling me
Son, would you please
Stay out of the streets
Because I don't want you do go astray
These are the problems of the world today
With the world messed up
Everything is tied up
People living scared
But there's no need to have fear
We've got something
That the enemy's don't
We've got each other
Stay close to your loved ones
Problems of the world today
Don't let our children go astray
Problems of the world today
Don't let our children go astray
Just keep the faith in God
He won't make it hardYou might also likeEmbed
