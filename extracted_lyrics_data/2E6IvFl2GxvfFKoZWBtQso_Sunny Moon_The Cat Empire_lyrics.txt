2 ContributorsSunny Moon LyricsI climb the ladder of those black and white keys
They take me out and into places some are real and some imaginary
And though she sways between a mystery and light
She walks with me, she walks with me alone into the night
Tonight I see the sunny moon is rising again
Three seasons passed since you were here then disappeared a friend
Yet now exploded from its dreams back in that place oh how it beams
And I see that you were glowing in the shadows
And you’ve been here all along
Ah you never left my side and now I feel my arms grow
Stronger
You may forget the details and you can forget the dates but never
Forget the moment when the night revealed her face
To be poor by lack of money but by god be rich in prize
I found my youth’s desire dark within her eyes
And the tent kept breathing something and then she cried -
‘Hold on we’re going somewhere else tonight’
We’re going somewhere else tonight baby yeh!
And my friends they are the heroes of the loneliness that’s life
And though everyone has a weakness only some they are defiant
While most of us can see only a few have the gift of sight
Would you walk with me
Would you walk with me alone into the night?
