1 ContributorPush Me LyricsBuild relationship on fear
It's like wolves around a bear
If just the strongest will survive
This relationship's made of ice
Coming like a common line
Fists are clenched and ready to fly
Sitting down to talk it out
It's not my style i'm here to shout
So come on push me
Push me now
Come on give me now
What i need from you
Is a threat
It's a threat i need
To start the game
Let it loose
It's a threat
That i need from you
To start the game and let it loose
Build relationship on fear
It's like wolves around a bear
If just the strongest will survive
This relationship's made of ice
So come on push me
Push me now
Come on give me now
What i need from you
Is a threat
It's a threat i need
To start the game
Let it loose
It's a threat
That i need from you
To start the game and let it loose
Come on push me
Come on push me nowYou might also likeEmbed
