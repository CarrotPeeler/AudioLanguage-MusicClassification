3 ContributorsAnother Day Lyrics
Fading moments fill up my eyes so wide
I don't know why things are strange, yeah, strange
But there's a will and my way is roaming light, roaming light
Roaming light, light

Please let me buy
Another day
Please let me try
To find another day

I'm riding a wave that's moving too slow
And it seems there is a void in my life, yeah, life
But there's a will and my way is roaming light, roaming light
Roaming light, yeah

Please let me buy
Another day
Please let me try
To find another day
Please let me buy, yeah
Another day
Please let me try
Oh, find another day
Yeah
You might also like
Yeah, I feel the need down deep inside
To get out of here and disappear

Yeah, please let me buy
Another day
Please let me try
To find another day
Please let me buy
Another day
Please let me try
To find another day
Another day
Another day
Another day

I've gotta find a way
Won't you lead today?
Gotta find another dayEmbed
