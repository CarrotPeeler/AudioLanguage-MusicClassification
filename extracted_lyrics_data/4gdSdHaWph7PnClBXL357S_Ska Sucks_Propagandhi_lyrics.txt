Ska sucks, ska revival isn't cool, you stupid fuck
The bands are only in it for the bucks
And if you don't believe me, you're a schmuck
But the trend will die out with any luck

Rudy, a message to you Rudy
A message to you Rudy
A message to you Rudy
Fuck you, Rudy!

Ska sucks, ska revival isn't cool, you stupid fuck
The bands are only in it for the bucks
And if you don't believe me, you're a schmuck
But the trend will die out with any luckYou might also likeEmbed
