Ah love, oh love, oh careless love
It's caused me to weep and it's caused me to moan
It's caused me to lose my happy home
Sorrow, sorrow to my heart
Sorrow, sorrow to my heart
Sorrow, sorrow to my heart
When me and my true love had to part
I cried last night and the night before
I cried last night and the night before
I cried last night and the night before
Gonna cry tonight and I'll cry no more
Oh, how I wish that train would come
Oh, how I wish that train would come
Oh, how I wish that train would come
And take me back to where I come fromYou might also likeEmbed
