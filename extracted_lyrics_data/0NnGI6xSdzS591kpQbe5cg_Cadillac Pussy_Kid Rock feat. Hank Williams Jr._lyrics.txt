3 ContributorsCadillac Pussy Lyrics
I seen a fly slimmy on the avenue
When I was on tour down in Baton Rouge
A mean little missy with a attitude
I played it smooth
No need to be rude
I stopped the ship
Stepped off like chewie
Ran some game like louie louie
Talked her on the bus
Talked her out of her shorts
No lie y'all, i'm here 2 report

She had some Cadillac pussy
Some Cadillac pussy
She had some Cadillac pussy
Man it would drive you wildSee Kid Rock LiveGet tickets as low as $95You might also likeEmbed
