3 ContributorsRock and Roll Tonight LyricsI gotta thousand bits of paper
All spinning in my head
I hope I see you later
I can't remember what you said
Something about keeping the grip
Keeping it tight
Before I lose control
I gotta rock and roll tonight
I got way too many questions
There all waiting on my call
I'm losing my direction
I'm dropping every ball
Got to find some color
These working shoes are getting too darn tight
I gotta loosen up
I gotta rock and roll tonight
Well you're bleeding for the money
But you never pay it back
Pressure gage is screaming and the face is
Starting to crack
This ain't no way to live
Lord you know this kinda life ain't right
Before I lose control
I gotta rock and roll tonightYou might also likeEmbed
