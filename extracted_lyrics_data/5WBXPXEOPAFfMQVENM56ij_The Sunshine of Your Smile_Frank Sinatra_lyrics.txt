3 ContributorsThe Sunshine Of Your Smile LyricsDear face will hold no sweeter smile for me
Were you not mine, how dark the world would be
I know no light above that could replace
Love's radiant sunshine in your dear face
Give me your smile, the love light in your eyes
I could not hold a fairer paradise
Give me the right to love you all the while
My world forever, the sunshine of your smileYou might also likeEmbed
