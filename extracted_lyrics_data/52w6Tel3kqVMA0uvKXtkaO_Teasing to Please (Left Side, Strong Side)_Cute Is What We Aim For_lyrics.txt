3 ContributorsTeasing to Please (Left Side, Strong Side) Lyrics
And so typically
And so typically
Soft, set back and perfectly dropped
Tough and learn and so perfectly taught
I am as he does
You are as she was
And that's because
And that's because
But you never try
But you never try

'Cause conflict and make your top pick
Restitch my ripped jeans
And take the old ones
And take the old ones out back
Sew them tight at the seams, please
I've got so many ripped knees, ripped knees

I'm selfish as selfish comes
You're giving me a run for my money
Honey

This is a hint that you take
And you pull and you find a way out
Of what you got yourself into
But when you try
But when you try to get out, you'll never find
That most definitely I will be attracted to you
If you pick my left side
Because you know how we do
You might also like
I'm selfish as selfish comes
You're giving me a run for my money
Honey

'Cause conflict and make your top pick
Restitch my ripped jeans
And take the old ones
And take the old ones out back
Sew them tight at the seams, please
I've got so many ripped knees, ripped knees

I'm selfish as selfish comes
You're giving me a run for my money
Honey
I'm selfish as selfish comes
You're giving me a run for my money
Honey
I'm selfish as selfish comes
You're giving me a run for my money
HoneyEmbed
