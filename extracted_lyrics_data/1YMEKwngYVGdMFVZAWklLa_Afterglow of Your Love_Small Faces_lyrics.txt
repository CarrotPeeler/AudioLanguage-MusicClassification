And loving you the way I do, yeah
There's everything I need to know
Just resting in the afterglow of your love

You, yes you have always been here
Feeling deep inside
A feeling that I could not see
Or touch, or try to hide
My love is in and around you, hey
I bless the day that I found you
So listen up, baby

And loving you the way I do, yeah
There's everything I need to know
Just resting in the afterglow of your love

Ah, don't it feel good, baby?

Love is like a voice in my head
Keeps turning 'round the things that we said

I'm happy just to be with you
And loving you the way I do
There's everything I need to know
Just resting in the afterglow of your love

So now I've told youEmbed
