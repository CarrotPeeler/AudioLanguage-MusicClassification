Even the world can feel me breathing
In to the count of 4, in to the count of 5
Spiders on the wall, they don't pay no alimony
I like the simple life, but
I'm drawn back to the heat and the light
Drinking your poison dry
Nobody loves an apothecary
Paradise lost on me
Hear all the children cry
I pay for my style with a bunch of people shouting curses at me
Reach for the sky on an airline
Spiders on the wall, they don't pay no alimony
I like the simple life, but
I'm drawn back
To the heat and the light
To the heat and the light
To the heat and the light
To the heat and the lightYou might also likeEmbed
