4 ContributorsWishing Star* Lyrics
Scared
I'm trapped, I'm too far
I'm numb, I'm too far
Fired up, I'm too far
(Census, what you cookin'?)

Staring up at the sky for a wishing star
I can't lie I'm so scarred
I'm blind itâ€™s too dark
I'm trapped, I'm too far
I'm bored whatchu on tonight
She looking forward to partying till the morning light
It takes a special type of bitch for me to fall in love
It takes a special type of bitch for me to want you, baby

Walking around lost, got my head in the clouds
Don't you leave me, don't you leave me
Don't you leave me baby, you making me anxious
Don't believe me when I tell you I'm in love when we angels
Wait to summer flee ,we way too broke

Still tryna heal from a bitch I call my everything
Reach inside my chest and tear my heart out with a guillotine
Why don't you need me here like the same way
I really need you here
You might also like
I'm bored whatchu on tonight
She looking forward to partying till the morning light
It takes a special type of bitch for me to fall in love
It takes a special type of bitch for me to want you, baby1Embed
