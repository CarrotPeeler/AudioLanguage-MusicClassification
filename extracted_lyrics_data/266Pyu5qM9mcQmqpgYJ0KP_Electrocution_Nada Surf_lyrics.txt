A little electrocution
Sometimes I feel I need it here
A little electrocution
The wire's hot, lights are red
A sparkle straight to my heart
I'm still livin' in the dark
I'm still livin' in the dark
I wouldn't mind if I could find
A little electrocution
My despair flows everywhere
To a little electrocution
Spools of coil across the sky
Unravelling out for miles
I've been bangin' on dials
I've been bangin' on dials
I wouldn't mind if I could find
A little electrocution
I need a jolt some thunderbolts
Of a little electrocution
No one loves you like I do
No one loves you like, you know, I do

All there is needs to die
I've been wondering why
I've been wondering why
I wouldn't mind if I could find
A little electrocution
I'm down quite beneath the light
Of a little electrocutionEmbed
