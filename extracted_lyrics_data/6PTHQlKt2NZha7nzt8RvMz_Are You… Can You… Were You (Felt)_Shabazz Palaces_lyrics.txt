47 ContributorsAre you…Can you…Were you? (Felt) Lyrics
It's a feeling, it's a feeling
It's a feeling, it's a feeling
It's a feeling, it's a feeling
It's a feeling, it's a feeling
It's a feeling, it's a feeling

I woke up to it: heavy, alight with trueness
Always aware of losing, compelled to knew it
My body traveled, my mind waits behind the music
My crime bemuses, relax inside my shiny blueness (Time)
Time: I understand it, but I never choose it
I can't explain it with words; I have to do it
The ship I came here on vanished, we automatic
Don't try to plan it, but chyeah, just when it comes, handle it
Behind the lessons, miles beneath the slick dressing
Niggas is stressing 'bout shit they should be sure they guessing
I twirl and cool and peel the rear view cause they are arresting
But wear jumpsuit and Chinese slippers, I'm still impressive (Up)
Up on the racks, old school cat from way back
Gave him my meal cause he's not wiping off, that's my impression
He asked me how you float all sharp and always have a fresh one?
And seem to know the answer to the most proverbial questions?
I told him Wangechi swirled it in a book of sketches
I find the diamonds underneath the subtlest inflections
Aw, dude, the spicier the food
When you chew, fuck they rules, it's a feeling
You might also like
It's a feeling, it's a feeling
It's a feeling, it's a feeling
It's a feeling, it's a feeling
It's a feeling

At a tender age, we learn to turn the page
To mind the screen and stage, to see who got the glaze
To hustle up or fade, either get made or played
Find your spot in the shade, and nigga, get paid
So we internalize that, but then we customize that
By the relationship between where our ground and our sky's at
I slowed it down once, everyone was going fast
So I sped up cause I ain't one to reach the end last
To where the grimy sparkles, amongst the shiny talkers
The pistol-poppers that make pretty noise and get them dollars
And while the world watch us, we send our street scholars
To bust some presidents in hundred-thousand-dollar watches
Some of the feds got us, some of us dead--'lotta us
Still solid though using all the lips the streets taught us
And what that heat cost us, and what that loss gave us
(Fucking with the people is always gonna come back around)

(It's about to be) Big movements from below
The golden age lies ahead
Strug-gles, pro-ceed
You can't lie to yourself, you can't lie how it felt
No surprise how the cards gettin dealt
(That's why) I won't be back for a long time6Embed
