7 ContributorsThe Hunter Lyrics
I'm in a big clean room
There's blood on my shirt
I'm in bad shape from the crash

Now I know it's all over
Now I know it's all over you
Something's wrong, something's wrong
Now I know it's all over
Now I know the hunter's you

Oh, you have the face
But I have the pictures
A secondhand love in a dying machine
This game turns me cold
I could show you some things
A child with a ghost in her eyes cries for me

Now I know it's all over
Now I know it's all over you
Something's wrong, something's wrong
Now I know it's all over
Now I know the hunter's you
You might also like
We break out
And we break out hungry
We're looking for the priest
And we're looking for you
I can't believe the noise
There's nothing I can do
We'll never get out of here alive

Now I know it's all over
Now I know it's all over you
Something's wrong, something's wrong
Now I know it's all over
Now I know it's all over you
Something's wrong, something's wrong
Now I know it's all over
Now I know it's all over you
Something's wrong, something's wrong
Now I know it's all over
Now I know the hunter's you

Something's wrong
I can't believe it
Something's wrong
I can't believe itEmbed
