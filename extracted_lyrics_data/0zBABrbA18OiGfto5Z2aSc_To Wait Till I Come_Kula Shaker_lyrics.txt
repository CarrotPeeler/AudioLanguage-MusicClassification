1 ContributorTo Wait Till I Come LyricsWill my true love wait?
Till I come?
Will my true love wait?
Till I come?
Tell my darling I'm travelling her way
Tell her to wait till I come
Will my true love wait, in a tower?
Will my true love wait, in a tower?
If I rest my head in this place
'neath the shady bower
Tell my darling, I've loved her so long
O tell her to wait till I comeYou might also likeEmbed
