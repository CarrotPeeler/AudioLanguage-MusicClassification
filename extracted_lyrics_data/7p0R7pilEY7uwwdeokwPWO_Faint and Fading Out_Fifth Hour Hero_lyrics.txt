1 ContributorFaint and Fading Out LyricsI've been diving head first for several years from now
Been swimming in the deepest waters
Now I feel like I've touched the ground
It feels harder to breathe bathed in total lack of sound
I've lost touch with my mouth
Tongue tied with
Everything else around
If I was to say
You'll never hear this again
Never hear of me again
What would you say?
And if I'm to complain
Of the bitterness in your eyes
Hatred in cheap disguise
Would you change a thing?
No!
I've been flirting with disasters
Acting as the mistress of happiness
While I'm just craving, for
Constancy and goddamn honesty
Don't throw your misery on me
If I was to say
You'll never hear this again
Never hear of me again
What would you say?
And if I'm to complain
Of the bitterness in your eyes
Hatred in cheap disguise
Would you change a thing?
You might also likeI guess you're drowning too
Your lips are turning blue
Yeah, bad times are on their way for sure
I won't be the witness of it anymore
If I was to say
You'll never hear this again
Never hear of me again
What would you say?
And if I'm to complain
Of the bitterness in your eyes
Hatred in cheap disguise
Would you change a thing?
If I was to say
You'll never hear this again
Never hear of me again
If I was to say
You'll never hear this again
Never hear of me againEmbed
