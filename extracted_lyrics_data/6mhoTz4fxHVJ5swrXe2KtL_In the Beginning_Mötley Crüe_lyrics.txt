14 ContributorsIn the Beginning Lyrics
In the beginning, good always overpowered the evils of all man's sins
But in time, the nations grew weak
And our cities fell to slums while evil stood strong
In the dusts of hell lurked the blackest of hates
For he who you fear awaits you
Now, many, many lifetimes later
Lay destroyed, beaten down, only the corpses of rebels
Ashes of dreams and blood stained streets
It has been written that those who have the youth, have the future
So, come now, children of the beast
Be strong and shout at the devilYou might also likeEmbed
