11 ContributorsDo Something Lyrics
"Funky for you, funk—, funk—, funk—, funky for you"
"You need to get up, get out and get something
Don't let the days of your life pass by"
"Funky for you, funky for you, funky for you"
"You need to get up, get out and get something"
"Funky—"
"You need to get up, get out and get something
Don't let the days of your life pass by"
"Funk—, funky for you, funky—, funky"
Get up, get out and do something
"Funky for you"

Like Cleopatra, got the masses at my feet
Got a living dwell down on easy street
I'm the latest craze, oh yeah
And if you stay a while
Inevitably, you're gonna bite my style
In your later days, well, well, well
Let me tell you what is fact and what is true
I get high a lot, ain't got much to do
I'm always in a daze, uh-huh
That was just a dream I had
Last night in my bubble bath
Next to my wishing well
Oh yeah, you gotta
You might also like
(Get up, get out and do something)
Don't let the days of your life pass you by, you got to
(Get up, get out and do something)
How will you make it if you never even try?
(Get up, get out and do something)
Can't spend your whole life tryin' to get high, you got to
(Get up, get out and do something)
'Cause you and I got to do for you and I

What's been happening? How you doing? Where you been?
I'm further behind now than I was back then
Lost in some old maze, uh-huh
Some years have passed me by
All I want is to go get high
I'll get it together some other day
And in my dreams I dwell, uh-huh, huh
'Cause all my dreams are swell
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah

(Get up, get out and do something)
Days of your life pass you by, you got to
(Get up, get out and do something)
How will you make it if you never even try? Come on and
(Get up, get out and do something)
Can't spend your whole life tryin' to get high, you got to
(Get up, get out and do something)
'Cause you and I got to do for you and I
(Get up, get out and do something)
How will you make it if you never even try?
(Get up, get out and do something)
'Cause you and I got to do for you and I
In my dreams I dwell, uh-huh, huh
'Cause all my dreams are swell, woo-hoo-ooh
You would too if you could see them
That's what I know, I gotta go
And get up, get out and, yeah


Heaven's at my feet
Got a living dwell down on easy street
I'm the latest craze, uh-huh
It's just a dream I had
Last night in my bubble bath
Next to my wi—, yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah

(Get up, get out and do something)
Your whole life, hey, hey
(Get up, get out and do something)
How will you make it if you never even try, baby?
(Get up, get out and do something)
Don't spend your whole life tryin' to get high, come on and
(Get up, get out and do something)
'Cause you and I got to do for you and I, alright
(Get up, get out and do something)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah
(Get up, get out and do something)
How will you make it if you never even try?
(Get up, get out and do something
Why don't you do something?)
Why don't you do something?
(Get up, get out and do something
Why don't you do something?)
Why don't you do?
(Get up, get out and do something
Why don't you do something?)
'Cause you and I got to do for you and I
(Get up, get out and do something
Why don't you do something?)
'Cause you know, you know that you gotta
(Get up, get out and do something)
Don't let the days of your life pass you byEmbed
