2 ContributorsKeep on Trippinâ€™ LyricsYour love's so satisfying and now you keep denying
Child, you don't hear what you're missing
So much I want to give ya
Let go of the love that's in ya
Say you got an answer, but it's my opinion
You just keep on trippin', keep on lippin'
Go on about your worldly airs
But before there's a total loss and you nail us to the cross
What about the men you claim affairs?
You just keep on trippin'
Keep on
Keep on trippin'
Keep on trippin'
Keep on
Keep on trippin'
Take what I have to offer
But my girl, I think I've lost her going to another other than me
I don't know what you've been smoking
But I'm laying here still hoping trippin' will bring you back to me
We're still a perfect match and I've rather grown attached
I know I love you tenderly
But just try to understand, selfish trying to be your man
Tonight, I'm just another human being loving you

Keep on trippin'
Keep on trippin'
Keep on
