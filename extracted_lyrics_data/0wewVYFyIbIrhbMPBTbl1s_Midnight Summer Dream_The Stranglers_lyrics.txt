Woke up on a good day
And the world was wonderful
A midnight summer dream
Had me in its spell
I dreamt about an old man
Sat and watched the rain all night
He couldn't sleep a wink as all the drops fell
He told me of the beauty
Hidden in our foreheads
And he told me of the ugliness
We show instead
And when we put a foot wrong
Do we learn from all the pain?
A midnight summer dream
As he watched the rain

Then at midnight he poured another drink and bent my ear
And after midnight, we sat up half the night, or maybe more
And he began to tell me what it was all for

I woke up in an armchair
He had gone I don't know where
He left me there to sit and look at the rain

But his words were echoing
A midnight summer dream
And then I wake again

Maybe I'll never find him
Maybe he's gone forever
Maybe I'll have to sit here
Watching the weather
Though one thing's pretty certain
Helped me make it in the night
And showed me somewhere else
Between wrong and right

So at midnight, if you can't sleep then I will bend your ear
And after midnight we'll sit up half the night, or maybe more
And I'll begin to tell you what it's all for

I wake up on a good day
And the world feels wonderful
A midnight summer dream has me in its spell
I woke up in an armchair
He had gone I don't know where
He left me there to sit and look at the rain
I don't remember much at all
But his words were echoing
A midnight summer dream
And then I wake again3Embed
