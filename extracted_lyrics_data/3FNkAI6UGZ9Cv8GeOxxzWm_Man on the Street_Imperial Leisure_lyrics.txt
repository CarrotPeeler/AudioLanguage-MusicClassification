1 ContributorMan on the street LyricsMan on the street are you feeling all right
All good and heading for the weekend
Girl on the street are you feeling all right
All good and heading for the weekend
Keep dashing in, pay your bills
Like your girlfriend, shake those lils
You can have your dirty thing as long as you don't make me ill
Be the best, be the worst
When your dead i'll drive your hearse
Before stage time we'll rehearse
???
I remember party's gone, seeing people straight for fun
Skinny dipping in pool,???
Nothing much has changed since ____ be girlfriend
We all go out and pretend
That we ain't goin round the bend
Man on the street are you feeling all right
All good and heading for the weekend
Girl on the street are you feeling all right
All good and heading for the weekend
Pay your rent with a grin
We call all your dirty sins
Wet your things in the night
Still grabbing everything in sight
Have a party tell your friends
It all works out in the end
Play the game, throw your cup
If you won't get paid then you won't get up
Everybody needs a change
As long as you refuse to fame
???
Now who'd of thought in this world of dreams
???
