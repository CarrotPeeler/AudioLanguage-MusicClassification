3 ContributorsI Wanna Hold You Tonight LyricsHard as a diamond's eye
Soft as a last goodbye
These are the things we learn to be
Calm as a distant light
That shines on an island night
These are the thoughts that say
It's not too late to tell you, I know I wanna tell you
I wanna hold you tonight
I wanna hold you tonight
I wanna hold you tonight
I wanna be there to catch you from falling
Cold as the arctic ice
Hot as a passion's rise
These are the days I spend alone
Pure as an infant's heart
That beats through the light and dark
These are the pictures of you
Always getting closer, I wanna hold you closer
I wanna hold you tonight
I wanna hold you tonight
I wanna hold you tonight
I wanna be there when love starts calling
I wanna hold you tonight
I wanna hold you tonight
I wanna hold you tonight
I wanna be there to catch you from falling

I only wish my heart could fly like it does when I sit and dream
I'll never wake alone again as I hold you tenderly
My thoughts were real and being with you now is the only thought that's strong
It's a lonely night and I'm trying to hold on
I wanna hold you tonight
I wanna hold you tonight
I wanna hold you tonight
I wanna be there when love starts calling
I wanna hold you tonight
I wanna hold you tonight
I wanna hold you tonight
I wanna be there to catch you from falling
I wanna hold you tonight
I wanna hold you tonight
I wanna hold you tonight
I wanna be there when love starts callingEmbed
