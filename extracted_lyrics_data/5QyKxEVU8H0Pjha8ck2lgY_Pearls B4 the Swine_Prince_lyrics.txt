5 ContributorsPearls B4 the Swine Lyrics
Da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da

If I leave my front door open
Would you come and visit me?
Just to slander my name hoping
That I would pack my bags and leave

If I did would you remember
To feed the dove and clean the cage?
And never count in front of the children
Lest they die of old age

I don't really know why we have to go our separate ways
Separate ways
Whether or not we grow after the seeds are sown
Only time can say

Can I offer you baklava
Or a bagel with cream cheese?
Will we say grace to our father
Holding hands down on our knees?
You might also like
Are we better off just fighting?
You on your side, me on mine
Are the words that I keep writing
Only pearls before the swine?

What makes men claim that you're a friend
When you are not at all?
They just want
They knock you down and then
They lift you up again, just to see you fall

But like a bird I'll keep on singing
A song that never leaves your mind
If nothing else you've taught me one thing
"Never cast your pearls before the swine"Embed
