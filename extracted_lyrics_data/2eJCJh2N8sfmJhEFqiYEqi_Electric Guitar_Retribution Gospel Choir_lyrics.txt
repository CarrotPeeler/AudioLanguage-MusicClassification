An electric guitar
Nobody plays like you
Your dirty old car
Closin' the bars
What are you gonna do?
What are you gonna do?
What are you gonna do?
It could be the pits
It could be a spider
How can you tell the two?
You've got the face
But we've got the fire
What are you gonna do?
What are you gonna do?
What are you gonna do?
What are you gonna do?
What are you gonna do?
What are you gonna do?
What are you gonna do?
What are you gonna do?
What are you gonna do?
What are you gonna do?
Could be a spiderYou might also likeEmbed
