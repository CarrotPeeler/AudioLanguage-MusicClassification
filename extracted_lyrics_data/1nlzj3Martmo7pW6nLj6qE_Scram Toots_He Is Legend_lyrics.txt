2 ContributorsScram Toots LyricsSo right away
I've seen the daylight break and freedom never felt so free
I'm leaving when the hands strikes three
I'll miss it here
I wanna speak to my lawyer dear
Blow me a kiss, Blow me away
Don't worry I'll send my love from wherever I end up
But I can never see you again, and that's the way it has to be
Now take this knife, do as i say
I swear you'll love again someday
Guilty virgin, you will be my black market bride
Blow me a kiss, Blow me away
She brought flowers for a year
Then the love of another stole the heart that once belonged to me
So walk the streets
Look for me, over and done
I had plans for us but now they are ruinedYou might also likeEmbed
