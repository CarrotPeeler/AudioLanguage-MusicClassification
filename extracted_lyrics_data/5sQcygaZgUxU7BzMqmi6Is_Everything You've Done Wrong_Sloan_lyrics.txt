4 ContributorsEverything Youâ€™ve Done Wrong LyricsDo your time to pay the price
For every thing you've done wrong, baby
In your life, you get so high
There's nowhere left to go but down
And don't believe that no one cares
'Cause we're here waiting for you, baby
Do your time and then come home for good
So don't hide yourself away
Let it shine, let it shine
Don't hide yourself away
Let it shine
If you ever feel in doubt
You have a place in my heart, baby
If I ever feel left out
I know I've got a place in yours
Don't believe that I wouldn't dare
To go and take you right back, baby
Do your time and then come home for good
So don't hide yourself away
Let it shine, let it shine
Don't hide yourself away
Let it shine, let it shine
Don't hide yourself away
Let it shine, let it shine
Don't hide yourself away
