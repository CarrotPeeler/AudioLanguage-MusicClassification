6 ContributorsRun for Your Death (More Pills) Lyrics
It's cold and dark
And everywhere I go I see your face
It's cool, I'm dead
More pills, more pills
More pills, more pills
It's cold and dark
And everywhere I go
I see your face

What's happening, what is this awful place
Where's the drain?
I'm slowly rolling in and out of
Faith

Oh, no
I think I'm gonna fucking let go
Overloaded, color-coded
But nothing ever came back into focus
You found a new obsession
So here is my confession to you, baby boo
From my point of view, we were a Catch-22

It's cold and dark
And everywhere I go I see your face
It's cool, I'm dead
More pills, more pills
More pills, more pills
It's cold and dark
And everywhere I go
I just want to escape

What's happening, what is this awful taste?
I'm insane
Please knock me out
With high-test benzocaine

Oh, yes
I think I'm just a little bit possessed
It's a big day when the king lays dead
From a supersonic missile to the chest
And I gave it all I had
Which wasn't exactly my best
(Let's make a mess)
I can never regret all the things I forget

It's cold and dark
And everywhere I go I see your face
It's cool, I'm dead
More pills
More pills
More pills
More pills
More!
Hey!
Hey!
More, hey!
Slowly rolling in and out of
(Hey!)
Slowly rolling in and out of
(Hey!)
Slowly rolling in and out of
(Hey!)
Slowly rolling in and out of
(Hey!)
Slowly rolling in and out ofEmbed
