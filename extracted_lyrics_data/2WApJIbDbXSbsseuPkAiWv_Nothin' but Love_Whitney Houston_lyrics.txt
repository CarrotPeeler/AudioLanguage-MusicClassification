8 ContributorsNothinâ€™ But Love Lyrics
Ooh, ah, baby

Here I sit by my window
Thinking about all the things that I've been through
There were times where I never thought
I would get to where I got to
Had one angel to guide me
Some who just violated my love
Now this is my chance to say, ain't got nothin' but love

For my family that raised me (Shout out, shout out)
And my teacher that done praised me (Shout out, shout out)
To anyone who tried to hate on me, yeah (Shout out, shout out)
Even the one's who tried to break me
Even the one's who tried to take me down

There's been haters since this world been going 'round
(Nothin' but love)
Why they take our dream and try to crush 'em down?
(Nothin' but love, nothin' but love)
I ain't even tryna hold on to that now
(Nothin' but love, nothin' but love)
Ain't got nothin' but, nothin' but love for ya
(Nothin' but love, nothin' but love)
You might also like
I could hold on to pain, but that ain't what my life's about
I ain't blaming nobody if I ain't got my stuff worked out
I got a love for my self, ain't gonna regret anything I've done
I just wanna sing my song, ain't got nothin' but love

For all the players on the street (Shout out, shout out)
To all my ghettos doing y'all thing (Keep on, keep strong)
To all my exes that done wrong me (Shout out, shout out)
Stepped on me, can't hold me down, oh

There's been haters since this world been going 'round
(Nothin' but love)
Why they take our dream and try to crush 'em down?
(Nothin' but love, nothin' but love)
I ain't even tryna hold on to that now, oh
(Nothin' but love, nothin' but love)
Ain't got nothin' but, nothin' but love for ya

To all the givers and the takers
To my crew from way back when (Way back when)
To the goers and the stayers (Oh yeah)
And the ones that I ain't met
For myself for sticking with me
For the one's I miss from up above (Oh)
Anyone who's ever been a part of me
Ain't got nothin' but love (Nothin' but, nothin' but)
I got nothing but love
There've been haters since this world been going 'round
(Nothin' but love)
Why they take our dream and try to crush 'em down?
(Nothin' but love, nothin' but love)
I ain't even tryna hold on to that now
(Nothin' but love, nothin' but love)
Ain't got nothin' but, nothin' but love for ya
(Nothin' but love, nothin' but love)
Ain't got nothin' but, nothin' but love for ya
(Nothin' but love, nothin' but love)
Ain't got nothin' but, nothin' but love for ya
(Nothin' but love for you)
(Nothin' but love, nothin' but love)
Ain't got nothin' but, nothin' but love for ya
(Nothin' but love, nothin' but love)
Ain't got nothin' but, nothin' but love for ya
(Nothin' but love, nothin' but love)
Ain't got nothin' but, nothin' but love for ya
(Nothin' but love, nothin' but love)Embed
