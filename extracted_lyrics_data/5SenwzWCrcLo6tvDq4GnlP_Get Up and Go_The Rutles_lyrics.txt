6 ContributorsGet Up and Go Lyrics
Workin' up a fever in a one horse town
Was a jockey by the name of Joe
He didn't have a lot of what you might call luck
But he had a lot of get up and go

Get up and go, get up and go
Get up and go back home
Get up and go, get up and go
Get up and go back home

Tall in the saddle in a one-horse town
Joe, he knew someday he'd hit the road
He traded with a dealer for a pick-up truck
And went lookin' for a medium load

Get up and go, get up and go
Get up and go back home
Get up and go, get up and go
Get up and go back home

Ow!
Get up and go
Get up and go back home
Everybody's waitin' for ya
You might also like
Cruisin' down the highway doin' sixty-five
In the middle of the double white line
His foot down on the gas and his head in the clouds
He didn't see the one-way sign

Get up and go, get up and go
Get up and go back home
Get up and go, get up and go
Get up and go back home

Ow!
Get up and go
Get up and go back home
They're all waitin' for ya

Get up and go, get up and go
Get up and go back home
Get up and go, get up and go
Get up and go back home
Get up and go, get up and go
Get up and go back home
Get up and go, get up and go
Get up and go back home
Ooo!Embed
