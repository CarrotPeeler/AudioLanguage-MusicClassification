1 ContributorSleep Comes Early for You LyricsNever knew of historical descent
Given an aversion to being good, an aversion to being decent
We will bleed and sweat the day
Imbibe night time, now past and present morays
Each in our own way
Each in our own way
In our own way
Because, in my mind, I will try to keep some things as new
Refuse the big death I am most rightfully due
Dodge steps written in form, once taken as true
Dodge steps written in form, now taken as true
Because you paid perpetual dues
To all of who knows who but you
Now you're through
But not the way I'd do
More like given permission to
If we could be honest, I'd want more for you
But it's like giving in, giving in to you
And I'm not through
If we could be honest, I would say
I want more from you
New painted in a corner
Waiting on your finest hour, the day you could finally shower
Or free your feet from the shoes of the weak
A day we could finally speak
Or I could remember your date of birth
You might also likeBecause you paid perpetual dues
To all of who knows who
But you, now you're through
But not the way I would do
But not the way I would do
More like given permission to
If we could be honest, I'd say
I wanted more from you
Because, in my mind, I will try to keep some things as new
Refuse the big death I am most rightfully due
Dodge steps written in form, once taken as true
Dodge steps written in form, sleep comes early for youEmbed
