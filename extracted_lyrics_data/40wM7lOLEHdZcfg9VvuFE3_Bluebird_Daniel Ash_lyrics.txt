And she is an answer
She picks you up and she will put you down
You didn't know that did you mister
She is here and she is all around
Ohh baby, you walk on the ground
And you know she is heaven sent
And you know she's what you're after
You walk around with your head in a cloud
But she knows you're upside down
She knows what's with you mister
And you could be so free tonight
Stretch out your wings and start your flight
Fly up and into the night forever
You could be ohh so free tonight
And when the bluebirds start to sing
Songs of love and everything
Just stretch out your wings and fly away
I'm with you, all the way
Now gone is pain
And gone all its glories
Gone is a life, with all its tiny stories
You could be, ohh so free tonight
Just fly away into that night

Bluebird, sing me a song
Bluebird, sing that song for meEmbed
