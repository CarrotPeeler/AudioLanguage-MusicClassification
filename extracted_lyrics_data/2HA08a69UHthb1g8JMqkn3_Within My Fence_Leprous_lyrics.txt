8 ContributorsWithin My Fence Lyrics
Aggressive mind
Sitting alone
Lying to find
Nobody home

The prophet shouts my name aloud
He says I'm stranded
Within my barricade
My life expanded

Dangerous tales
Make no sense
Hurting myself
Within my fence

The prophet shouts my name out aloud
He says I'm stranded
Within my barricade
My life expanded
The prophet shouts my name out aloud
He says I'm stranded
Within my barricade
My life expandedSee Leprous LiveGet tickets as low as $43You might also likeEmbed
