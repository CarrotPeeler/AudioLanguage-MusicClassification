1 ContributorIf You Love Me Lyrics
Ooh, ooh, ohh

I know you never ever meant to hurt me
I know you never meant to break my heart
I love when you're close to me
It’s how it's supposed to be
But now something's wrong
Is your love gone? Is love gone?

If you love me
Why won’t you let me know?
If you need me
Why won't you let it show?
What will it take?
How long must I wait?
Tell me now
Tell me how
Tell me how long I must wait for your love

Today's another day I spent without you
Tomorrow wonders will you change your heart
I love how we used to be
I guess now you're used to me
Where did we go wrong?
Is your love gone? Is love gone?
You might also like
If you love me
Why won't you let me know?
If you need me
Why won't you let it show?
What will it take?
How long must I wait?
Tell me now
Tell me how
Tell me how long I must wait for your love
Wait for your love
I'm right here waiting, ooh!

Ooh, ooh, ohh
Ahh, Ahh, Ahh, Ahh, Ahh
I love how we used to be
But now something's wrong
Is your love gone?

If you love me, (love me)
Why won’t you let me know? (na na)
If you need me, (ooh)
Why won’t you let it show? (let it show)
If only you knew (if only you knew)
How much I do (how much I do)
Love me now (ooh)
Tell me how (ooh)
Tell me how long I must wait for your love
If you love me, (if you love me)
Why won't you let me know? (let me know)
If you need me, (if you need me)
Why won’t you let it show? (let it show)
What will it take? (what will it take)
How long must I wait? (how long must I wait)
Tell me now (tell)
Tell me how (tell)
Tell me how long I must wait for your love
Wait for your love
I'm right here waiting
Wait for your loveEmbed
