2 ContributorsCherish (The Night, The Life, The Moon) LyricsTime to fade out into dreams
And quit a world of sounds and schemes
I close my eyes and leave it all behind
The moon is calling
Cocoon is falling
Hide in a shell and feeling so secure
Cherish the night
The emotion
Web we weave
Under delusion
Cherish our life
Seems devotion
- A perfect illusion -
Memories of you and me
Holydays down by the sea
Friday movie - the Chinese take away
At noon I’m leaving
Soon I’ll be retrieving
What’s blazing the trail and givin'me the cure
Cherish my life
True emotion
The web I leave
Of my own motion
Cherish my life
Real devotion
- I´m gone for good -You might also likeEmbed
