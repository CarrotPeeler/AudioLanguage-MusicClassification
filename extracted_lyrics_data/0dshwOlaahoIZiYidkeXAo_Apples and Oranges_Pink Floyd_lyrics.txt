Feeling good at the top, shopping in sharp shoes
Walking in the sunshine town
Feeling very cool
But the butchers and the bakers in the supermarket stores
Getting everything she wants from the supermarket stores
Apples and oranges
Apples and oranges
Cornering neatly, she trips up sweetly
To meet the people, she's on time again
And then
I catch her by the eye, then I stop and have to think
What a funny thing to do cause, I'm feeling very pink
Apples and oranges
Apples and oranges
I love she
She loves me
See you
See you
See you
Thought you might like to know
I'm her lorry driver man
She's on the run
Down by the riverside, feeding ducks in the afternoon tide
(Quack, quack, quack, quack)
