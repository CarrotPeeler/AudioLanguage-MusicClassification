1 ContributorMoses LyricsMoses couldn't take / a step into / the promised land
He watched from the cliffs / you crossed his mind / then it passed
Wiser blood spilling now
You kissed my neck and breathed into my ear
I came into my pants and turned a shade of red
Wiser blood is spilling now
Before you fisher king burned his mouth it was a dream
Before your eden fall wised your blood and turned to white noise
Moses / no one’s watching now
Eyes in the screen / you're a brain in a jar
I knew how to love so much better when i was five
Wiser blood is spilling now
Moses / no one's watching now
Take like a demon / Fuck like a carbomb unsatisfied
If I let myself need you how long before we die
Trapped souls like smoke like white noise in a scarecrow’s ear
If I let myself need you how long before we dieYou might also likeEmbed
