Baby got big and baby get bigger
Baby get something baby get more
Baby baby baby was a rock n roll nigg​er
Oh look around you all around you
Riding on a copper wave
Do you like the world around you
Are you ready to behave
Outside of society they're waitin for me
Outside of society that's where I want to be
Lenny!
Baby was a black sheep baby was a whore
You know she got big. Well she's gonna get bigger
Baby got a hand got a finger on the trigger
Baby baby baby is a rock n roll nigg​er
Outside of society that's where I want to be
Outside of society they're waitin for me
Those who have suffered understand suffering
And thereby extend their hand
The storm that brings harm
Also makes fertile blessed is the grass
And herb and the true thorn and light
You might also likeI was lost in a valley of pleasure
I was lost in the infinite sea
I was lost and measure for measure
Love spewed from the heart of me
I was lost and the cost
And the cost didn't matter to me
I was lost and the cost
Was to be outside society
Jimi Hendrix was a nigg​er
Jesus Christ and Grandma too
Jackson Pollock was a nigg​er
Nigg​er nigg​er nigg​er nigg​er
Nigg​er nigg​er nigg​er
Outside of society they're waitin' for me
Outside of society if you're looking
That's where you'll find me
Outside of society they're waitin for me1Embed
