You gotta stop drinkin' that wine, sonny boy
You gotta stop drinkin' that wine, sonny boy
If you don't stop drinkin' that wine
It's gonna poison your mind
You gotta stop drinkin' that old wine, sonny boy

You drink Champagne, it's gonna be better for you
You drink Champagne, it's gonna be better for you
Everybody's going out
Going out to enjoy
You gotta stop drinkin' that wine, sonny boy



Hell, you drink whiskey, just have a tiny wee drop
When you drink whiskey, just have a tiny wee drop
When you drink whiskey, have a tiny wee drop
'Cause you just don't know when to stop
You gotta stop drinkin' that wine, sonny boy

You gotta stop, bop, bop, bop
Gotta stop, bop, bop, bop
You gotta stop drinkin' that wine, sonny boy
Everybody else going out
They're going out to enjoy
You gotta stop drinkin' that wine, sonny boy
You might also like
Gotta stop, bop, bop, bop, bop
You gotta stop
Stop drinkin' that old wine, sonny boy
If you don't stop drinkin' that wine
It's gonna poison your mind
You gotta stop drinkin' that wine, sonny boyEmbed
