2 ContributorsWhatâ€™s Under My Bed Lyrics
It's every night
The same routine
It feels like
Something is creeping up on me

What's that lurking behind that door?

Monsters chasing after me, I get no sleep
I'm running but no matter what, it gets me nowhere
Something's under my bed, snapping at my leg
I'm frozen

I'm not freaked out
It creeps and crawls
I cannot
I cannot sleep without a light

What's that lurking behind that door?

Monsters chasing after me, I get no sleep
I'm running but no matter what, it gets me nowhere
Something's under my bed, snapping at my leg
I'm frozenYou might also likeEmbed
