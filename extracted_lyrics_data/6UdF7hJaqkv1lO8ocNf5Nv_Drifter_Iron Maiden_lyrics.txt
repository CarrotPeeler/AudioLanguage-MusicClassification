23 ContributorsDrifter Lyrics
Rock and roll, yeah!

Look out now, baby, won't you take me away?
Sitting here, I think it's gonna be a new day
I'm gonna get my song, and I can't go wrong
I gotta keep on roaming, gotta sing my song

What you feeling when you hold me tight?
I wanna cuddle up to you tonight
Gonna get you feeling so secure
Listen, child, don't you see there's a cure?
Anywhere, got to get you away
Feels so good, think it's gonna be a new day
I'm gonna get my song till it can't go on
I'm gonna keep on roaming, gonna sing my song

Ooh, yeah, ow-whoa, whoa
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah, ow-whoa, whoa
I keep on drifting

What you feeling when you hold me tight?
I wanna cuddle up to you tonight
Gonna get you feeling so secure
Listen, child, don't you see there's a cure? Ooh, yeah
Anywhere, got to get you away
Feels so good, think it's gonna be a new day
I'm gonna get my song till it can't go on
I'm gonna keep on roaming, gonna sing my song
I wanna rock 'n' roll! Ooh, yeah!
