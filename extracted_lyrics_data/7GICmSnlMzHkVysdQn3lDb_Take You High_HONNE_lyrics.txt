4 ContributorsTake You High Lyrics
I guess you already know
You've already seen it
Playing over in your mind a bunch of times
How far would it go?
You better believe it
I get that feeling will be going through the night
Am I right?

We must never go backwards
Cause it don't seem the natural way to go
And I can't think of a bad word
To say about you and the things you do
You better look up cause

I'll take you high
With me, ain't a limit
I'll treat you unlike some other guy
I'll take you high
They say life is meant for livin'
Girl stick with me and you'll be alright

So what do you know
It's already beginning
Well you got eyes on you from all over the room
Well she's a no go, so you better give in
Yeah you can look but you can't taste the sweet perfume

We must never go backwards
Cause it don't seem the natural way to go
And I can't think of a bad word
To say about you and the things you do
You better look up cause

I'll take you high
With me, ain't a limit
I'll treat you unlike some other guy
I'll take you high
They say life is meant for livin'
Girl stick with me and you'll be alright
I'll take you high, high
Stick with me and you'll be alright
I'll take you high, high
Stick with me and you'll be alright

When do I get to hold you?
I keep dreamin' of you
Every single night
Will I ever get to love you?
It's all I ever wanna do
Give me some love and
I'll take you high
With me, ain't a limit
I'll treat you unlike some other guy
I'll take you high
They say life is meant for livin'
Girl stick with me and you'll be alright
I'll take you high, high
Stick with me and you'll be alright
I'll take you high, high
Stick with me and you'll be alright

High, high
High, high1Embed
