Standing on a beach somewhere
Looking for something to see
As the beach rolls in, I swear
It's bringing something to me
Maybe one day I'll have what I want
Someone to stand next to me
Until then I'll just wait and watch
As the foam rolls in--to me

Beach foam baby, be my baby
Beach foam
Beach foam baby, be my baby
Be my baby, be mine

Standing on a shore somewhere
Looking for something to be
As the beach rolls in
I swear, it's bringing something to me
Maybe one day I'll have what I want
Maybe one day I'll follow the streams
But until then I'll just wait and watch
As the foam rolls in--to me

Beach foam baby
Beach foam
Beach foam baby, be my baby
Be my baby, be mine...Embed
