You, you were a friend
You were a friend of mine, I let you spend the night
You see, it was my fault
Of course it was mine

I'm too hard at work
Have you ever heard of anything so absurd
Ever in your life?
I'm sorry for wasting your time

Who am I to say that this situation isn't great?
Well, it's my job to make the most of it
How could I ever know that it would happen to me?
Not that easy

Hey, what's that you say?
You're not blaming me for anything
Well, that's great, but I don't break that easy
Does it fade away?

So that's why I'm apologizing now
For telling you I thought that we could make it
I just don't get enough to believe that
We've both changed
You might also like
Who am I to say that this situation isn't great?
It is my time to make the most of it
Of course I didn't know that it would happen to me
Not that easy, no
No, no, no
When all along the fault's been up for grabs
Why can't you have it?
Well, if it's for sale, what is your offer?
I will sell it for no less than what I bought it for
Pay no more than absolutely zero

Well, neither one of us deserves the blame
Because opportunities moved us away
And it's not an easy thing to learn to play
A game that's made for two, that's you and me
The rules remain a mystery
See how it's easy

So who am I to say that this situation isn't great?
Well it's our time to make the most of it
How could we ever know that this would happen to me?
Not that easy, no
No
When all along, the fault is up for grabs and there you have it
Well it's for sale, go make your offer
Will I will sell it for no less than what I bought it for?
Pay no more than absolutely zero
Lord, Lord1Embed
