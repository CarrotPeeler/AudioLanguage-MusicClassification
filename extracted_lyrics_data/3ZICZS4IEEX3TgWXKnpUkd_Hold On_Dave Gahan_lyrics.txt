2 ContributorsHold On Lyrics
You keep sending me all these things
I'm learning how to smile
You keep sending me all these things
I think I'll stay awhile

Tried to talk to you in my dream
You looked at me and smiled
Your smile said to me
I'll have to wait awhile
I have to wait awhile

Hold on
You opened my eyes today
Hold on
Another surprise


You keep giving me all these things
I see them in your smile
You keep giving me all these things
I think I'll stay awhile
I guess I'll stay awhile
You might also like
Hold on
You opened my eyes today
Hold on
Another surprise


Hold on
You opened my eyes
Hold on
Another surprise
Hold on
You opened my eyes today
Hold on
Another surpriseEmbed
