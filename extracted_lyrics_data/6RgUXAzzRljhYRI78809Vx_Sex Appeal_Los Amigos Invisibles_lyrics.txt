2 ContributorsSex Appeal LyricsYou look so good in your pantyhose
So sexy and yes; so glamorous
That makes me think you're a super star
And i am one of your freaky fans
You drive me nuts when you wear leggings
They fit you well and they make me feel
So weird so wrong cause i only see
How weak i am to your sex appeal
How weak i am
How weak i am to your sex appeal
How weak i am
How weak i am
You boost my day with your g-string
Can't take my mind of the little thing
Your hips your legs are the perfect team
Tonight itÂ´s right to commit a fling
You look so good in your pantyhose
You drive me nuts when you wear leggings
You boost my day with your g-string
How weak i am to your sex appeal
How weak i am
How weak i am to your sex appeal
How weak i am
How weak i am
