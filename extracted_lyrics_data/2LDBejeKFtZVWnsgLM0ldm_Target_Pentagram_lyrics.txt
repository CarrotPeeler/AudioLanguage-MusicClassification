Yeah
You got the guts, I've sure got the time
Last time you were comin', baby, I left you behind
Yeah, alright
Mmm hmm

We'll play a game that you won't forget
You'll be the target and I'll get you yet mercy
Yeah, what I said

See how loud baby can moan
You're filthy again like you were back at home
Alright

How much?
Never could say I liked you a lot
But you're firin' me up and it's got to come out
Yeah
Alright, yeah let's get it
Yeah
