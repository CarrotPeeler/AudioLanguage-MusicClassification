2 ContributorsPeace River LyricsI come from a place
Run by a man named Mr. Page
Took everything and he wanted more
Gun and a knife and he used them both
Smack ya in the head in public
He kicked ya down and he think nothing of it
Take your head down, swallow your pride
If you wanna live to see the night and
I guess I had my fill
I ran from the valley to the top of the hill
And even though I got away
I couldn't shake Mr. Page and
I've fulfilled all my desires
I couldn't put out the fire
Thing going in my head
That I need to put to rest
So I would take off, fly off
Get a little bit of step in my walk
Jack London been giving me a call and
I'm done fallin'
So I could take off, fly off
Get a little bit of step in my walk
Swim in the Peace River for a month
Oh ho, darling
You might also likePack my bags and went
To a place I promise I've never been
Call my phone but cowardly steps
It turned me to a cowardly man and
Y'all wouldn't believe what I've seen
Mr. Page, he was broke at the knees
Somebody so brave and strong
Just turned weak and worn and
The fear, it disappeared
And the hate, it followed him
Could the place it occupied
Be replaced by love and light so I would
Take off, fly off
Get a little bit of step in my walk
Jack London been giving me a call and
I'm done fallin'
So I could take off, fly off
Get a little bit of step in my walk
Swim in the Peace River for a month
Oh ho, darlingEmbed
