7 ContributorsHeart Behind My Eyes Lyrics
Sitting in the dark with so many why's
How can I ignore you tears or hear your cries
So many times I didn't let you win
Like a fool I walked away
I started an argument, hey, yeah
(Why do I do the things I do)
When my heart belongs to you
I failed to help you truly see
What you really mean to me
So give me a minute so I can show
The way it looks before you go
The heart you own that beats in me
Hear my plea, baby

Baby, don't leave, please don't go
I was a fool not show
How I really feel inside
I was scared
'Cause I've been hurt a time or two
But nothing compares to losing you
I'm willing to put my pride aside
To show you the heart behind my eyes

I can see you tired
Maybe wanna be apart
I can't say that I blame you
'Cause I made loving me so hard
Shorty understand, that I'm just a man
Who wants to learn your love
So don't let go my hand, hey

I've let you down so many times
Took saying goodbye for me to realize
How I failed to help you see
What you truly mean to me
So give me a minute, look in my eyes
So you can see down deep inside
The heart you own that beats in me
Is begging please

Baby, don't leave, please don't go
I was a fool not show
How I really feel inside (Feel inside)
I was scared (I was scared)
'Cause I've been hurt a time or two
But nothing compares to losing you
I'm willing to put my pride aside (Put my pride)
To show you the heart behind my eyes
Baby, don't leave, please don't go
I was a fool not show
How I really feel inside (Feel inside)
I was scared (I was scared)
'Cause I've been hurt a time or two
But nothing compares to losing you
I'm willing to put my pride aside
To show you the heart behind my eyes
My heart will die inside (My heart)
If you ever said goodbye (My heart)
Is begging for you to stay
Girl, I'm gonna change my ways (My heart)
It wants to open up (My heart)
And give you all this trust (My heart)
Just won't give up
Please don't take you love, my ooh

Baby, don't leave, please don't go
I was a fool not show
How I really feel inside (How I really feel)
I was scared (So scared)
'Cause I've been hurt a time or two (I've been hurt)
But nothing compares to losing you (Nothing compares)
I'm willing to put my pride aside (Put it aside)
To show you the heart behind my eyes

No, hoo, the heart behind my eyes
Just let me show you
The heart behind my eyesEmbed
