1 ContributorWho Takes the Fall? LyricsThey want to see the nations under single rule
It's absolute power in the hands of a fool
The bird of Armageddon, wings pointing to the sky
Reflected like a harlequin, no tears left to cry
Seated on his towered throne, too late for reasons why
The jester's waiting all alone, who's the first to die?
Discarded, unguarded, their fates are already decided
Unshaded, degraded, there's nothing left for you
Divided, misguided, trust should never be one sided
Mistreated, conceited, the world don't turn for you
The stringless puppets conscience seeks to gain control
From the men of power who's joker fits the role
Evermore the struggle sees fit to wear him down
Voices raised in anger, no more the voiceless clownYou might also likeEmbed
