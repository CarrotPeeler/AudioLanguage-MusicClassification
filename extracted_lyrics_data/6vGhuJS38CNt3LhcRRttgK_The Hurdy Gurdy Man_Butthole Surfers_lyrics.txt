Thrown like a star in my vast sleep
I opened my eyes to take a peek
To find that I was by the sea
Gazing with tranquility

Then when the Hurdy Gurdy Man
Come singing songs of love
And when the Hurdy Gurdy Man
Come singing songs of love

Hurdy gurdy, hurdy gurdy, hurdy gurdy, gurdy he sang
Here comes the Hurdy Gurdy Man, singing songs of love
Hurdy gurdy, hurdy gurdy, hurdy gurdy, gurdy man

Histories of ages past
Hung in light and shadows cast
Down through all eternity
The crying of humanity

Then when the Hurdy Gurdy Man
Come singing songs of love
Then when the Hurdy Gurdy Man
Come singing songs of love

Here comes the Hurdy Gurdy Man, singing songs of love
Hurdy gurdy, hurdy gurdy, hurdy gurdy, gurdy man

Here comes the Hurdy Gurdy Man, singing songs of love
Hurdy gurdy, hurdy gurdy, hurdy gurdy, gurdy man
