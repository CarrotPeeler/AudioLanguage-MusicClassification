3 ContributorsBy The Evening LyricsWell as of right now, I am feeling
Like packing up my things, and leaving
By the evening
I will be long gone
Two coats of heavy paint, Won't hide
The rows of rotting wood, you know this city's dying
And by the evening
I will be long gone
And if you're looking for, some kind of freedom
You're taking every chance, but I see now
By the evening
I will be long gone
(x2)And by the evening
I will be long gone
By the evening, by the evening
I will be long goneSee Benjamin Booker LiveGet tickets as low as $34You might also like4Embed
