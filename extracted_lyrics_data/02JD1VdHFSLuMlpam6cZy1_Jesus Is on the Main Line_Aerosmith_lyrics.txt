Jesus is on that main line, tell Him what you want

He will come in a hurry, just tell Him what you want
He will come in a hurry, just tell Him what you want
He will come in a hurry, just tell Him what you want
Oh, call Him up and tell Him what you want

Jesus is on that main line, tell Him what you want

Hey, Jesus is on that main line, just tell Him what you want
Oh, call Him up and tell Him what you want

If you're sick and you can't get well, just tell him what you want
If you're sick and you can't get well, just tell him what you want
Oh, call Him up and tell Him what you want

Because Jesus is on that main line, tell Him what you want
Jesus is on that main line, tell Him what you want
Oh, Jesus is on that main line, just tell Him what you want
