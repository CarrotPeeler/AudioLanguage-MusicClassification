But you drove it far too far
You've got so many things
But they'll see you in the end
Big time
You ain't no friend of mine
Big time
You ain't no friend of mine
Big time
You ain't no friend of mine
Big time
You ain't no friend of mine
You've always got some money
But you never buy the drinks
You always dress so shit unique
But everybody thinks
Big time
You ain't no friend of mine
Big time
You ain't no friend of mine
Big time
You ain't no friend of mine
Big time
You ain't no friend of mine
You might also likeYou're just big big time
Big big time
Big big time
Big big timeEmbed
