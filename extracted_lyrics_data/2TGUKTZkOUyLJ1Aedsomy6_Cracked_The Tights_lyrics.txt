I can't explain but that's too bad I can't refrain, that makes you mad
The safe is cracked and so am I, I can't remember how to die
I can't remember how to live, And these days, it must be a gift

When I get lonely pain in my heart
I fly to Jupiter in my mind
I think of you with tears in your eyes
I look at him, he's laughing

I lie in bed on Sunday Morning, through the bars the world is calling
I'm in for years and out of time, but wanting you is not a crime
Human feelings out of season, heard them call it agе of reason
No more freedom, no more hopе, I'll slit my wrists and that's no joke

When I get lonely pain in my heart
I fly to Jupiter in my mind
I think of you with tears in your eyes
I look at him, he's laughing

If you and I would stand between us, will this burden never leave us
I can't explain but that's too bad I can't refrain, that makes you mad
The safe is cracked and so am I, I can't remember how to die
I can't remember how to live, And these days, it must be a gift

When I get lonely pain in my heart
I fly to Jupiter in my mind
I think of you with tears in your eyes
I look at him, he's laughing
When I get lonely pain in my heart
I fly to Jupiter in my mind
I think of you with tears in your eyes
I look at him, he's laughingEmbed
