1 ContributorElectricity (Rush) LyricsSweet surrender
I'd give all my love, I'd give all my life just to be with the one, become electrified
When we touch, feel the rush
Yeah it must be electricity
When we touch, feel the rush
Yeah it must be electricity
(Electricity)
(Electricity)
You reached into my chest
You grabbed hold of my heart
You loved it all, the rest, every single part
When we touch, feel the rush
Yeah it must be electricity
When we touch, feel the rush
Yeah it must be electricity, yeah
Electricity (x4)
You know it's taking control
You know it's taking over
Oh you never let me go
'Till I'm...
It's over
It's over ooooh
It's over
It's over oooohYou might also likeEmbed
