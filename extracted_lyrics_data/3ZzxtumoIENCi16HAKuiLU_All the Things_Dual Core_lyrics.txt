27 ContributorsAll The Things Lyrics
This one's dedicated to all the hackers

Even out settle scores quick
Our disaster recovery requires even more disks
Put your bytes up, prove it or you forfeit
Got my C64 and we blew it into orbit
M. Bison with eight straight perfects
Overvolt emotions make hate break circuits
In case you heard, it's a named fake service
Optimize our runtime to escape verdicts
Got an integer scope flow
That they can't sign
Passing code, didn't sanitize
Command lines; land mine
So before, they'll see me after
I'm Advice dog
Courage Wolf
Plus Philosoraptor
Don't prove we're human unless we really hafta
My team built schemes that destroyed recaptcha
Hate what they see, finish this chapter
By the way we're not any geeks, we hack into NASA
You might also like
Drink all the booze
Hack all the things
Drink all the booze
Hack all the things
Drink all the booze
Hack all the things
Got this Vodka and this Redbull
They still give me wings
So we drink all the booze
Hack all the things
Drink all the booze
Hack all the things
Drink all the booze
Hack all the things
Zero through three
We're in every single ring

I'm just waiting 'til my Blackberry dies
Cause I'll replace it with a Raspberry Pi
Don't compare to this track
It makes everything they said dull
Neutralize any threat
Turn Red Skull to /dev/null
They killed virus writers that we mentioned
But instead they ascended to the VXHeavens
Then reincarnate as live wires
Still inside we hide ciphers in signed device drivers
Which school will we hit next?
They didn't learn the format
So we've gotta printf()
Next step is a chin check
Freestyles that I spit best
They didn't decrypt yet
I crush internet MCs in rhyme battles
Get your WiFi tackled
Hak5 Pineapple
I don't think you'll like my Snapple
Cause I popped it with vodka
And a cyanide capsule

We drink all the booze
Hack all the things
Drink all the booze
Hack all the things
Drink all the booze
Hack all the things
Got this Vodka and this Redbull
They still give me wings
So we drink all the booze
Hack all the things
Drink all the booze
Hack all the things
Drink all the booze
Hack all the things
(You know there's going to be security, right?)

First we drink all the booze
Then hack all the things
Then backdoor the firmware
On anything you bring
Regardless of the hardware, service, or encoding
Connect it to the internet
And someone's gonna own it
This is for the pirates who clap
And love the sound
Attacking from the cloud
Then we're back and underground
There's no masking from us now
We pop Tor nodes around the globe
Track and hunt you down
Hacked on schedule, added to your calendar
Devices online; here comes another challenger
State infiltrated, so undercover
This is for my comrades who stare at their debuggers
And trace every buffer
Examining the code flow
Haven't been to sleep? Better pop another No-Doz
I think I'll need a planet sized urn
'Cause some men just wanna see the world burn
Your turn

Drink all the booze
Hack all the things
Drink all the booze
Hack all the things
Drink all the booze
Hack all the things
Got this Vodka and this Redbull
They still give me wings
So we drink all the booze
Hack all the things
Drink all the booze
Hack all the things
Drink all the booze
Hack all the things
Zero through three
We're in every single ring4Embed
