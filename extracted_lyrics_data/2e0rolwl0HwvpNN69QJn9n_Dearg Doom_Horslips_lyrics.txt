3 ContributorsDearg Doom LyricsMy love is colder than black marble by the sea
My heart is older than the cold oak tree
I am the flash of silver in the sun
When you see me coming you had better
Run . . . run . . . run 
From Dearg Doom
You speak in whispers of the devils I have slain
By the fire of my silver Devil's Blade
And still you dare to flaunt yourself at me
I don't want you, I don't need you
I don't love you, can't you see
I'm Dearg Doom
And when the stars go out
You can hear me shout
"Two heads are better than none
One hundred heads are so much better than one"
I'm a boy who was born blind to pain
And, like a hawk, I'll swoop and swoop again
I am the flash of Hawkeye in the sun
When you see me coming you had
Better run . . . run . . . run .
