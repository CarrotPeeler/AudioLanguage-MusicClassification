1 ContributorSnakes (Wybe) Lyrics
Hol' up, there's a slight disorder, I need peace of mind, I need breasts with my order
Peep the dope flex, I sex on your daughter, enough a dem vex, but dead at close quarters
You nuh wanna ramp with the Zuu, when the doo doo doo hit, what the flip you gone doo doo doo?
Pause, remove the stain from your draws, remove the fangs from ya jaws
Givin' it raw, hop up in the Benz or the Porsche, I got visions of my niggas wit' some vice city whores
Magaritas, mamacitas, with some nice titties on, never liked me, forget you and the kite that you on
On sight, mashin' down ya whole life, mashin' conch in your wife
You down to ride then hol' tight, you diss the mob that's dog bite
You diss the mob that's dog bite

C'mon on now, nah baby, na na na
You already know
Like, don't no other man do it like you
Don't nobody touch me like you, baby it's yours
I'm yours
[Chorus}
Issa wybe, issa flippin wybe, run up on these guys
Draw the line, conch shell never die, all they do is fly
Cut 'em low, come through puffin' dro, all they see is smoke
In dey eye, all up in dey eye, issa flippin wybe
Issa wybe, issa flippin wybe, run up on these guys
Draw the line, conch shell never die, all they do is fly
Cut 'em low, come through puffin' dro, all they see is smoke
In dey eye, all up in dey eye, issa flippin wybe

Issa wybe, issa flippin wybe, I don't know these guys
Look alive, I see snakes approachin', think I might be high
Who'd've knew? Play it safe my nigga, you know what to do
Look alive, run up on these guys, Issa flippin wybe
Issa wybe, issa flippin wybe, I don't know these guys
Look alive, I see snakes approachin', think I might be high
Who'd've knew? Play it safe my nigga, you know what to do
Look alive, run up on these guys, Issa flippin wybe

Hella snakes on my front lawn, lil' baby gimme head 'til it lockjaw
Lil' shimmy shimmy yah, 'til my rocks off, got the semiautomatic if they pop off
Got the hot sauce, why you hatin' when it's not yours? Bet she gimme head for the nachos
Bet she gimme head when I knock off, aimin' at yo head, you a knockoff
Zuzu why you mad, why you like that? Niggas sendin shots, send 'em right back
Never trust a hoe, never wife that, my flex Bruce Wayne with a nightcap
I'm givin' 'em the blackest magic, I'ma dog, I'ma Nassau savage
Assess the damage, run up on 'em with a conch in traffic, run up on 'em with a conch in traffic
His eggs are scramblin'

Issa wybe, issa flippin wybe, I don't know these guys
Look alive, I see snakes approachin', think I might be high
Who'd've knew? Play it safe my nigga, you know what to do
Look alive, run up on these guys, Issa flippin wybe
Issa wybe, issa flippin wybe, I don't know these guys
Look alive, I see snakes approachin', think I might be high
Who'd've knew? Play it safe my nigga, you know what to do
Look alive, run up on these guys, Issa flippin wybe
Issa wybe, issa flippin wybe, I don't know these guys
Look alive, I see snakes approachin', think I might be high
Who'd've knew? Play it safe my nigga, you know what to do
Look alive, run up on these guys, Issa flippin wybe
Issa wybe, issa flippin wybe, I don't know these guys
Look alive, I see snakes approachin', think I might be high
Who'd've knew? Play it safe my nigga, you know what to do
Look alive, run up on these guys, Issa flippin wybeEmbed
