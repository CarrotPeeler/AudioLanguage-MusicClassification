2 ContributorsJust A Little Lyrics
Don't I treat you right?
Make you feel real good?
I give good lovin'
I won't stop lovin' 'til I got you
Saying that you're ready to be all mines, baby
And I appreciate all the love we make
There's nobody better
Ain't no other woman could do what you do
Never had to tell you nothing, you rocks it right

It's a feeling I can't explain
I just feel like I gotta have you all the time
The way you touch
The way you kiss
Baby, I just wish you could be mines
But I'm satisfied

If you can't give me all your love
Just give me some
Just a little, oh, just a little
Oh, just a little, oh, just a little
If you can't give me all your love, some is enough
Just a little, oh, just a little, oh, just a little
Just a little bit of your love
You might also like
Ooh, making love to you feels good
Tell me how you want it, baby
Chitown boy 'bout to drive you crazy
Got the sweetest love and I want it every day
You're the reason I made this record, baby
Make me say ooh, I like it when you rock it like that
Don't stop the love, bring it right back

It's almost like you're in my head
You know what I'm thinking
You know what I'm feeling
And I can't say it's emotional
It's definitely physical
But I want more, but I'm satisfied

If you can't give me all your love
Just give me some
Just a little, oh, just a little
Oh, just a little, oh, just a little
If you can't give me all your love, some is enough
Just a little, oh, just a little, oh, just a little
Just a little bit of your love
If you can't give me all your love
Just give me some
Just a little, oh, just a little
Oh, just a little, oh, just a little
If you can't give me all your love, some is enough
Just a little, oh, just a little, oh, just a little
Just a little bit of your love
I told you how I feel, baby
A better way, play the guitarEmbed
