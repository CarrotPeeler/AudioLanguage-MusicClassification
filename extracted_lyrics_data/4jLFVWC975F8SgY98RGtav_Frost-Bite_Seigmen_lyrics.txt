2 ContributorsFrost-Bite LyricsSatelites are turning
Television's burning
Shine on water
Does it realy matter?
And if violence make the wind flow
I will break every bone in your body
And if silence make the wind blow
I will listen to the beat of your frosen heart
The temperature is rising now
The talking waters is running dry
The lips are seald, no thoughts revealed
And some will always say
There is a reason for everything
The love we gave, the gifts I made
The sun still shine for yesterday
And all my plastic angels
Are falling from the sky
Though all I've done was ever wrong
The ships is sailing , love has gone
So now It's down to me
And all I want is felicityYou might also likeEmbed
