9 ContributorsSweet Spot Lyrics
Let's hit the sweet spot, oh, I, I, I, I
I'm ready to go, I want candy toni-i-i-ight
Let's hit the sweet spot, oh, I, I, I, I
I'm ready to go, I want candy tonight

Yeah, I wanna take you back to my spot
You can be the candy girl in my shop
We both know what we cravin', why not?
Make tonight first class with no stops
Girl, you know I run a love game, never play Uno
You wanna leave, follow me to the two-door
Rock your culo, love it when you call me your papi chulo
I got a thing for you, you got a thing for me
Heard she kiss the Milky Way and bring to life your fantasies
You're sweeter than Mama's homemade Kool-Aid
Touch it, then make the seas split two ways
You love it, I do too, girl, don't play
I'm just waitin' to hear you say

Let's hit the sweet spot, oh, I, I, I, I
I'm ready to go, I want candy toni-i-i-ight
I got a taste and I'm hooked on you for life
My, oh my, hit the sweet spot tonight
See Flo Rida LiveGet tickets as low as $63You might also like
Yeah, I wanna hit the spot that gets you hot
And makes you feel like everybody need to have it this sweet
Baby, just a hit, just speak, I got your candy, shawty
Come around, give it to you that deep
Ooh, don't you get me started, hit the afterparty all night
You done ran into a freak that'll take you home
Make you moan, watch the throne
Yeah, lil mama, I'm the king of these sheets, gotta love it
Girl, you want it, you can have it, no question
Been a whole lot of rubbin' and touchin'
What you know about the candy I'm hustlin', musclin'?
Talkin' that Russian
Bring it back like, baby, who you rushin'?
I been ready, never talkin' sweet nothings
I'll be the first to give your body sweet justice
So pack a luggage and let's, let's

Let's hit the sweet spot, oh, I, I, I, I
I'm ready to go, I want candy toni-i-i-ight
I got a taste and I'm hooked on you for life
My, oh my, hit the sweet spot tonight

Feel your guilty pleasure, come and get it tonight
You gon' get it tonight, oh-ah, oh-ah
Know what your body's cravin', baby, I'ma bring you to life
You gon' get it tonight, oh-ah, oh-ah
Don't be shy, let me take you for a ride (Ah-oh-ah)
Know what your body's cravin', baby, I'ma bring you to life
You gon' get it tonight, oh-ah, oh-ah
Let's hit the sweet spot, oh, I, I, I, I
I'm ready to go, I want candy toni-i-i-ight
I got a taste and I'm hooked on you for life
My, oh my, hit the sweet spot tonight2Embed
