I gotta show you what I can do
But everything connects, and that ain't nowhere
Well, maybe they're just giving you all you ever wanted
And maybe you never ever know what that was
And maybe you're just finding it out now
With a Vietnamese baby on your mind
Technology satellite, well
What's wrong today and why was
Everyone so busy they've forgotten why they're playing
And he said, what's wrong today is what wrong with you
You're so sorry, busy sorry, that's all you do
With a Vietnamese baby on your mind
Your pretty little mind
Match me a slingshot with
Every lightbulb, queen, and I gotta
Show you more busted glass that any girl ever seen
Since I been blastin, I've been blowin, I've been bangin away
You got to bang it away
You got, baby, such a fabulous game
But I've gotta calm so down to play
With a Vietnamese baby on your mind
Your pretty little mind
You might also likeWhen I'm getting home to you
I've got to show you what I can do
But everything connects, and that ain't nowhere
No no no, baby, no nowhere
It just won't do, no no no
I'm talking about your overkill
Talking 'bout your overkill
Got to shout about your overkill
Now that it's over, now that it's over
Now that it's over, what ya gonna do?1Embed
