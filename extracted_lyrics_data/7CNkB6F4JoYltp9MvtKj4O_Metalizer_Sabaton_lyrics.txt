Distorted guitars are breaking ground
The drum pounding faster than my heart
The vocals are screaming extreme art
The passion for metal drives us forth
The best heavy metal comes from north
The powerful tunes, spectacular shows
The audience screams in ecstasy, yeah

Metal, (Metal)
Back with a vengeance
Metal, (Metal)
All that I need is heavy metal
(Metal)
Screaming together
Metal, (Metal)
Metal is all that I need
While hell bends for leather we stand strong
A rocker can party all night long
The school couldn't teach us rock 'n' roll
The school couldn't help us reach our goal
We live for the magic in the sound
Distorted guitars are breaking ground
The powerful tunes, spectacular shows
The audience screams in ecstasy

Metal, (Metal)
Metal is all that I need


Metal, (Metal)
Back with a vengeance
Metal, (Metal)
All that I need is heavy metal
