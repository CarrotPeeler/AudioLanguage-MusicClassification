10 ContributorsEarthshine Lyrics
On certain nights
When the angles are right
And the moon is a slender crescent
Its circle shows
In a ghostly glow
Of earthly luminescence

Earthshine
A beacon in the night
I can raise my eyes to
Earthshine
Earthshine
A jewel out of reach
Form a dream to rise to
Earthshine

Floating high
In the evening sky
I see my faint reflection
Pale facsimile
Like what others see
When they look in my direction
You might also like
Earthshine
A beacon in the night
I can raise my eyes to
Earthshine
Earthshine
Stretching out your hand
Full of starlit diamonds
Earthshine

Reflected light
To another's sight
And the moon tells a lover's story
My borrowed face
And my third hand grace
Only reflect your glory

Earthshine
Stretching out your hand
I can raise my eyes to
Earthshine
Earthshine
You'll still out of reach
Form a dream to rise to
Earthshine
Form a dream to rise to
