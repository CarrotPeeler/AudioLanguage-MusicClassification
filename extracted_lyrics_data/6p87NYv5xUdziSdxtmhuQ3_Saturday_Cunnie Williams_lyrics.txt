3 ContributorsSaturday LyricsI'm happy the week is over
Time to saturday to begin
Gonna get out I'm gonna party
Telephone all of my friends
Morning is looking good and I'm ready
Spent all day polishing my Ben
Cause it's saturday in the city
Feelin's right to the night to begin
You work yourself so hard all week long
Now it's time that you get your groove on
Week is over friday's at an end
I can't wait
I can't wait
For saturday to begin!
Oh oh I can't wait
Down on a saturday
I can't wait, ey ey eyy

I like to party (Yeah baby me too)
Till the sun comes up in the morn (Huh huh)
It's the end of the week and I'm out on the street
Tryin' to find something to get into get into, get into (Huh huh huh)
Cause I've got to get down down down down (Get down baby)
I can't stay at home (Huh huh)
Got to get out and hear me some music (That's right)
Saturday don't you know here I come here I come (Hmm)
You work yourself so hard all week long (All week baby)
Now it's Time that you get your groove on (That's right)
Week is over friday's at an end
