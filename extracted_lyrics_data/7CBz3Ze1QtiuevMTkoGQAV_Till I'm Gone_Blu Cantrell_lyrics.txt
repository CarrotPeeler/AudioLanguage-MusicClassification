3 ContributorsTill Iâ€™m Gone Lyrics
I gave him love
I gave my all
I gave myself
I lost control
Held nothing back
I just let go
Now, I'm realizing
I've been all alone

He won't love me till I'm gone, gone (Gone)
But I don't want him
'Cause he's wrong, wrong (He's dead wrong, yeah)
And now he love me
'Cause I'm gone, gone (Ooh)
But it's just too late
'Cause now I found someone

I'm looking for an everlasting love
The kind that every girl like me dreams of
When you said you love me, I realized you lied
Now all I have for you is goodbye, yeah

He won't love me till I'm gone, gone (He won't love me)
But I don't want him
'Cause he's wrong, wrong (Wrong, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
And now he love me
'Cause I'm gone, gone (He love me 'cause I'm gone)
But it's just too late
'Cause now I found someone (Found someone, yeah)

Lord, tell him something, 'cause he lost his mind
Oh yeah
If I could rewind, I wouldn't give him the time
Yeah, I'll take all this pain
And throw all away, oh-oh
I realize
You ain't good enough for me, oh yeah

He won't love me till I'm gone, gone (He won't love me till I'm gone)
But I don't want him
'Cause he's wrong, wrong (He's dead wrong, yeah)
And now he love me
'Cause I'm gone, gone (Yeah, he loves me, yeah)
But it's just too late
'Cause now I found someone (Woo, yeah, yeah, yeah)
He won't love me till I'm gone, gone (He, oh-oh)
But I don't want him
'Cause he's wrong, wrong (He's so wrong, oh)
And now he love me
'Cause I'm gone, gone (Love me 'cause I'm gone gone gone, yeah)
But it's just too late
'Cause now I found someone (I fond someone, yeah, yeah, yeah)
He won't love me till I'm gone (He love me when I'm gone yeah)
But I don't want him
'Cause he's wrong, wrong (He's wrong, he's wrong, oh-oh-oh)
And now he love me1Embed
