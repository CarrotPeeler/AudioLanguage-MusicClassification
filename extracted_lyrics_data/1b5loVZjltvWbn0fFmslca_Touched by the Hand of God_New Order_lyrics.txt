1 ContributorTouched by the Hand of God Lyrics
I was standing by the ocean when I saw your face, I couldn't look at you
I guess you knew it, but I never realized that we were through
And I'm now down here all alone with every feeling that I own
You can't take that away
And with every breath we take and the illusions we create will come to you someday

And I was touched, uh, by the hand of God, ooh
Never knew it
But of course I was
I was touched (Touched)
By the hand of God
I never knew it, ooh
But of coursе I was

Hoped to do the things in this world that I wanted to
Bеcause everything I own, it belongs to you
And I've never looked at you in a sexual way in my life before
But then I've never woken up like this so desperately before

And I was touched, oh, by the hand of God
Never knew it
Of course I was
Touched by the hand of God
Never knew it
But of course I was

Touched by the hand of God
I never knew it
But of course I was
I was touched by the hand of God
I never knew it
But of course I was, ooh
