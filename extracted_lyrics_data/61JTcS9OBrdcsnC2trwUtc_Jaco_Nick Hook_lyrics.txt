4 ContributorsInebriated.m4a Lyrics
It's all good
Yah
When I was his age I was doing a whole lot of heavy fucking drinking

I got some drugs in my hoodie
I got a pulse I need pussy (true)
Need all to know that I'm coming
Not here to play like no rookie
Not here to be overshadowed by rappers
Who can't wear they chains in the shower
She asked me what's up, I'ma Casper the funk
To the bathroom get suck, I'ma just be an hour
We from a part of the town, that nobody expected to get it
Well shit
I'm who they talking about
The topic is who really doing it big
Hoes who was pinching my cheeks
Be the pick of the week
And we still be good off it (still)
Ain't no more with the mystique
If you with it then speak, I'm retracting my offer
Haram presence with the ash on 'em
Give it  to the pass on 'em
Pitchin fan 'vestments to a cash donor
Bet on me, run it up let's get bags on 'em
Baby I'm not for any, you be 'round too many
Yes men that dap it just sounds of the pity
Loungin' for clout like you down to be Diddy
A legend, I'm finna go down in my city
Yuh
I'm tryna stack til I can't (yuh)
None of us flash in the pan
I don't take advice cuz this parts of Hawaii
That I know the like the back of my hand (that's facts)
It's hand over your business and fuck everybody
If you try to ask for my stance
My raps misunderstood
I'll be out with the goods
While you wondering how did this happen again
Bitch I don't miss, I'm talking my shit
I had a gut feeling, y'all make me sick
This just another song y'all just won't get
This just another song y'all just won't hear
Bitch, I am your kid
Bitch, I am your brother
I disregard others I'm stacking my chips
Another lost cause, coming out from abyss
Bitch I don't, huh
Bitch I don't, huh
Live from abyss
You might also like
Yah
Yah, yah bitch
Said go head and dive in
See what the devil love ya
Hoes head, dead flesh
Lettuce, cheddar, foccacia
Someone to be the boss of
Reunite with a lost one
All expense trips for every town you been the talk of
We was twelve tryna marry bitches from pop ups
Peace of fist from the martian
Stealing tears from a walk up
Kids at the park would mock us
We ain't ever been cool
Now I'm here for my bully's money and his letterman too
Oh it's a riot outside?
Let it ensue
Let the world burn with my credit
And rent if it's due
I told the money I do
And let my friends fuck up on it
You going to be Norton or Ruffalo
Bitch go 'head pick a monster
I'm coming live from abyss
Better act like you know
And if you don't by the end
Hope your departure is slow
And I may cease to live in peace
Forgive me lordy, had me twisted
In my blood to wreak this havoc
And Ambaum just assisting
I'm the 120 weighting
Little who that with the board
Hold the bottle like it's voodoo
And my foes coming up short
Break 'em outside I'm on tour
I'm losing marbles and keycards
Used to be the world broke me
And I go home for the recharge
Now I bring the world with me
Tryna be there for people
But I'm too numb to relate
I'm a young drunk - who called?
Hearing enough to build a career
Who introduced a little marriage
In presents and disappear
But now I'm coming like I never did
Represent the underbelly youngins from the nitty-grit
Had the Motorola Razr asking for some titty pics
Now I get the city lit
Such a pretty bitch
Watching Jack Nick flicks in a two flat
Plaque on the wall got it off of boom bap
And I'm too smacked
And your crew wack
This shit weak - let me stopEmbed
