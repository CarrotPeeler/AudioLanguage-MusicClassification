10 ContributorsKilled by Death Lyrics
Show on!

If you squeeze my lizard
I'll put my snake on you
I'm a romantic adventure
And I'm a reptile too

But it don't make no difference
Cause I ain't gonna be easy, easy
The only time I'm easy's when I'm
Killed by death
Killed by death
Killed by death
Someone

I'm a lone wolf ligger
But I ain't no pretty boy
I'm a backbone shiver
And I'm a bundle of joy

But it don't make no difference
Cause I ain't gonna be easy, easy
The only time I'm easy's when I'm
Killed by death
Killed by death
Killed by death
Someone
You might also like
Killed by death
Killed by death
Killed by death
Someone's gonna killed by death, someone
Someone

Killed by death
Killed by death
(Killed by a bunch of death)
Killed by death

Killed by death
(Shut out your mouth, shut out your mouth!)

Killed by death

Killed by death
I'm dead, I'm dead, I'm dead
I'm dead, I'm dead, I'm dead
Killed by death
Killed by death
Ahhhhhhh!1Embed
