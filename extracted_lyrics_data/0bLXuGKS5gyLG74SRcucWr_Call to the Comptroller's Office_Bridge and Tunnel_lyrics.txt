1 ContributorCall To The Comptrollerâ€™s Office LyricsA verse from that old crooner's song played
Said that "Every street's a boulevard in Ole' New York."
Well if that's the case, then this is the biggest f*cking pothole I have ever seen
We're all so stubborn, anxious, and detached
And that's just the way they'd have it
Too embarrassed to say that we could build something better
"I don't give a f*ck," can't get you off the line every time
The core of the apple is rotten, but somehow the skin still shines
So what's the commonality?
The smell of the river or these boxes that we rent?
The nightlife is the despot to the f*cking desperate
Don't ever let these bright lights or bustling feet make us feel small again
Just hold on to me
Hold on to me, if you need it
I'm awake with yesterday's coffee resting in the pot
So hold on to me, if you need it
I know you're tired
These days it seems like all of us are
So hold on to me, if you need it
I'm awake with yesterday's coffee resting in the pot
So hold on to me, if you need it
We struggle against the contradictions of rush hour and dinner time
The core of the apple is rotten, but somehow the skin still shines
We can build something greater than the tallest building in the cityYou might also likeEmbed
