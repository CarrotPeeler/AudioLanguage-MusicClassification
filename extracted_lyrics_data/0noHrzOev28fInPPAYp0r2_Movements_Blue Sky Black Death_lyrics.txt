1 ContributorMovements LyricsOn the grayest of days
It seemed so clear
My reflection raised
Felt your skin so near
Movements slow
I need to know
Movements slow
I need to know
Forgotten how to crave
A warmth like this
You tighten the hands
Around my wrists
As we shiver
I must not rest
All will unfold
With what is left
Movements slow
I need to know
How this will never end
How i will gain control
Movements slow
I need to know
You might also likeOn the grayest of days
It seemed so clear
My reflection raised
I felt you so near
Movements slow
I need to know
Movements slow
I need to know
Movements slow
I need to know
Movements slow
I need to know
Take me for what it's worth
While our motion disappears
I am here right now
While i motion disappears
And when morning comes
I will be all, all yours
Take me for what it's worth
While our motion disappears
I am here right now
While our motion disappears
And when morning comes
I will be all, all yours
On the grayest of days
It seemed so clear
My reflection raised
I felt you so near
Movements slow
I need to know
Movements slow
I need to know
Movements slow
I need to know
Movements slow
I need to know
Movements slow
I need to know
Movements slow
I need to knowEmbed
