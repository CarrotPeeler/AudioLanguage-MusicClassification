1 ContributorCharlieâ€™s Room LyricsYour fragrance is pulling me against the wall
Don't stop, stop talking, I want it all
The fear of you manipulating me
Is pulling me together like gravity
Eyes so blue and skin so tight
Take me to where the tables are white
You and me are like father, daughter
Blood will always be thicker than water
Daddy, come get my -
Body is sweating, I'm high
Your face is in-between my thick thighs
Oh darling they say time really flies
So quick, you can even see
The sex pain dripping all over me
I don't care what you say
Im coming home to your bed tonight baby
We're losing our hearts to one another
We hate ourselves but love each other
Scream and shout all over the place
Baby please don't leave, say my name
Don't lie, you're crazy, you're out of your mind
Devil calm down that's the evil I like
The tension that you bring back to me
Knocks me out. I can barely breathe
Lips so soft spare me a bite
Take me to where the parties all night
Hope you don't mind, i'l stay a while
Cuz you know the feeling of an only child
Sorry
I know it's
Too late to apologise
Cuz you've already told me a hundred times
Again, sorry, guess this is written along the
Lines of peace. I bet the angles on her knees
Don't worry demon, only a tease
Believe me I know the feeling
But you're the only thing that I've been craving
You might also likeWe're losing our hearts to one another
We hate ourselves but love each other
Scream and shout all over the place
Baby please don't leave, say my name
Don't you start lying, saying you've had enough
Honey i'm still here, don't try acting tough
You act like you know the feeling of pain
Stop driving me nuts, i'm going insane
Crying my heart out just for you to say
Make me feel guilty for you again
You haven't been yourself lately
Let me fix that for you
Relax, pain free

Baby please don't leave, say my nameEmbed
