3 ContributorsTimebomb Generation Lyrics
One, two, three!

Your children are shooting up society
'Cause you made money making killing a commodity
At war on TV from a far away field
A time bomb generation, the nation's fate is sealed

Kill the stain inside our heads
Tell the policemen to give up
We live in defiance of empty times
Kill the stain inside our heads
Apathy until we're dead
We live in defiance of empty times
No more empty times!

Time bomb is the building tension stretched across the glove
Time bomb, watch the media lying, "Just another episode"
Time bomb to transform awareness in our hearts, deep inside
From man to man to nation, end the fear, conquer pride

Kill the stain inside our heads
Tell the policemen to give up
We live in defiance of empty times
Kill the stain inside our heads
Apathy until we're dead
We live in defiance of empty times
You might also like
Of empty times... Oi! Oi! Oi!
What does it mean to take their power and push it away?
Overcome this culture and the lies they tell them everyday
Find a voice for a better future and a place for you and I
To face our fears, fall down to rise back up
(Whoa-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh)
Fall down to rise back up
(Whoa-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh)
Fall down to rise back up
(Whoa-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh)
Fall down to rise back up
(Whoa-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh)
Fall down to rise back up
No more empty times!

So-whoa-whoa-whoa
We live (We live!) In defiance
We live in defiance of empty times
We live (We live!) In defiance
In defiance of empty times!Embed
