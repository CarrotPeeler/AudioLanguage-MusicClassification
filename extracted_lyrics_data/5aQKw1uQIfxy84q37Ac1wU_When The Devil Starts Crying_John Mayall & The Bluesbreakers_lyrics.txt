1 ContributorWhen the Devil Starts Crying LyricsWhen the devil starts to cry and he's lonely
The whole idea is to get you feeling sorry
I say it's not some problem that you can't solve
So don't come around and laying your trips on me
Well, he's got no business stirring you up
Don't you know you just stop along the way
Thinking you can save him and change his luck
Well, I don't want you ever going to him
The heart of a jealous man is so dark
He ain't got eyes and he got no light to see
I think it's time to straighten up this house
You gonna stop your running around and get on over
Well, he's got no business stirring you up
Don't you know you just stop along the way
He's got you thinking you can save him and change his luck
Wеll, I don't want you ever going to him
He's got no businеss stirring you up
Don't you know you just stop along the way
He's got you thinking you can save him and change his luck
Well, I don't want you to go to him
When the devil starts to cry and he's lonely
He's just trying to feeling sorry
I think it's time to straighten up this house
You better stop things you're doing and get on over

Don't you know you just stop along the way
Got you thinking you can save him and change his luck
Well, I don't want you ever going to him
I don't want you ever going to him
I don't want you ever going to himEmbed
