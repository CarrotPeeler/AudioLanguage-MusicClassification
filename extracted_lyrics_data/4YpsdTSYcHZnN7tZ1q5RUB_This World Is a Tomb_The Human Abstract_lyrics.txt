2 ContributorsThis World Is a Tomb LyricsSlaving for my solace of mind
Digging in the sand until there's blood on my hands
Careless to the state I'm in, I've so long been alone
I've so long been alone, I can't go on
Rain down, rain down and cleanse my soul
Flow like a river
Forging insight by pagan torchlight
In cadence warlike, we draw tears from the sky
Because the well's run dry
Rain down, rain down and cleanse my soul
Flow like a river
I've spread out my seed, it's gone in all directions
It starts to feel like the promised land is a fantasy
And heaven has been swallowed by the desert
In a drought without submission, not a cloud in the sky
This course keeps getting harder the more I try
And I dig up dry bones, and the corpses cry
As they open their eyes to see the world's decay
This world's a tomb
There's a clamor in my heart and it's over
Where is my prize?
It's over
Where is my prize, my promised prize?

Rain down, rain down and cleanse my soul
Flow like a river
Rain down, rain down and cleanse my soul
Flow like a river
Rain down, rain down and cleanse my soul
Flow like a riverEmbed
