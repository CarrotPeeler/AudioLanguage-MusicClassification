Mother, see you in the may when I'm a boy
Believer - monologue exemplifies a lust
It's true

Funny how it only seems to work at night
Jeweler, pick me something pretty for my wife
So true
So true

Mother, see you in the may when I'm a boy
Believer - monologue exemplifies a lust
It's so true
So true

It's so true
It's so true
It's so true
Oh oh, it's so true
It's so true
Oh oh, it's so true
It's so trueYou might also like7Embed
