1 ContributorThe Giver LyricsHoly mother, Lord and maker
I am just a soldier of the free
You know I was once a taker
Lonely tired and sick, I could not see
Captured with the evidence
The seasons come and go
A prisoner in his residence
I'm haunted, don't you know?
Don't you know?
I live and die, I take the pressure
I wear a coat of armor you can't see
And now I feel the final measure
Slow but quickly, this was meant to be
Captured with the evidence
The seasons come and go
A prisoner in his residence
I'm haunted, don't you know?
Shake out the fear
Until I fall
And I will hear
Here come the Giver
You will be free
Just like the river
That leads to the sea
You might also likeAs I look down from the tower
I see the fields of hope that wait for me
Bring the dawn upon the hour
Ascending to the sky for you to see
Captured with the evidence
The seasons come and go
A prisoner in his residence
I'm haunted, don't you know?
Shake out the fear
Until I fall
And I will hear
Here come the Giver
You will be free
Just like the river
That leads to the sea
My flesh and blood
I let my conscience suffer me
And it broke my will somehow
It shook me down, I'm on my knees
But I won't be took to the bow
I let my conscience suffer me
And it broke my will somehow
It shook me down, I'm on my knees
But I won't be took to the bow
Here come the Giver
You will be free
Here come the Giver
You will be freeEmbed
