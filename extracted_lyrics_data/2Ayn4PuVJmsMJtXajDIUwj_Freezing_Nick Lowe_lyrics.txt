1 ContributorFreezing LyricsIt's Freezing, Freezing
Windchill is twenty below
Whole town is under snow
Mercurys falling it just won't quit
What are you you doing out in it
Come inside love
Into the warm
It's Freezing
Insides where you should
Don't try to argue with me
Out there its cruel and cold
Please do as your told
Come inside love
Into the warm
Come inside love
Into the warm
It's freezing, freezing
Inside where should be
Dont try to disagree
Walk in and set me free
From this yearning
Come inside love
Into the warm
It's Freezing, Freezing
