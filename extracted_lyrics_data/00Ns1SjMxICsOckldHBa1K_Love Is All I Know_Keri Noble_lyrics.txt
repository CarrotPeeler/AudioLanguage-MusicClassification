2 ContributorsLove Is All I Know LyricsPeople want to know what I believe in
They think I should take a stand
Stand up, speak out, tell us about
Jesus, sex, politics, the color of my lipstick (oh man)
I have tried to do the best I can
Living on the right side of the tracks
But shame on myself if I try to tell
Anybody else how to live (oh man, oh man)
All I know is
Love, love, love
Love, love, love
Love, love, love, love
Love is all I know
When did love become old hat
Why must it be any more than that
'Cuz haven't we already enslaved, killed and maimed
Enough in everybody else's name (oh man, oh man)You might also likeEmbed
