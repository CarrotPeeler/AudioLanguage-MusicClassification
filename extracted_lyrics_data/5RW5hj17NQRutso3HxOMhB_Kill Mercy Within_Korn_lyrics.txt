7 ContributorsKill Mercy Within Lyrics
Disgraced
Expendable, we are not really real
Mirage of solitude
Is what they try to heal
And I will not be made to feel
We are sealed in a fake charade

Spewing vile atrocities
Bringing existence to its knees
I will manifest my sins
And I will kill mercy within
Immersed in this hypnotic spell
Influenced by the hate that swells
I'm not terrified anymore
There's nothing left but open sores

Disengaged
Relinquish the reality I've known
I'm feeling like I'm alienated
From my own
And I will not be made to feel
We are sealed in a fake charade

Spewing vile atrocities
Bringing existence to its knees
I will manifest my sins
And I will kill mercy within
Immersed in this hypnotic spell
Influenced by the hate that swells
I'm not terrified anymore
There's nothing left but open sores
Spewing vile atrocities
Bringing existence to its knees
I will manifest my sins
And I will kill mercy within
Immersed in this hypnotic spell
Influenced by the hate that swells
I'm not terrified anymore
There's nothing left but open sores
There's nothing left but open sores2Embed
