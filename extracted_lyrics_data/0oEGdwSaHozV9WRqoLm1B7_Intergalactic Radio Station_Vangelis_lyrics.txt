..so many things that you can't believe
Past designs, future designs
Cables in the bend
Second-hand sounds
Future sounds
Synthesised dialogues
Incomprehenseble software
Hi Jon, let's break some rules!
Here comes the sun
We're doing some recordings later
Same ol' factory you know
Here's some names for you
'Polyester landscape
Nylon oxygen
Ashes to concrete.'
Etcetera.....etcetera....
Etcetera.....
"Oh, by the way
It's been a beautiful morning
What a morning
Great morning
It's a great moring man."You might also likeEmbed
