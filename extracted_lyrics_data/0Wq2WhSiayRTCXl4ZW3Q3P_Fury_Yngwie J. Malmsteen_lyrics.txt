3 ContributorsFury LyricsI now will tell you all a story
That no one ever heard before
It is the tale about the fury
Remember wisdom is your strength
It said you're such a fool
Just let my evil rule

No, it's burning like a flame
Now nothing seems the same
I've lost control of mind and body
My soul is in its hand
Its wish is my command
Enslaved forever by the fury
By the fury, no!
At first it came to me in visions
And that was filling me with fear
And when my fear became desire
To let the demon burn my soul
It said: "Don't fight in vain,"
"I'll make you love the pain."

No, it's burning like a flame
Now nothing seems the same
I've lost control of mind and body
My soul is in its hand
Its wish is my command
Enslaved forever by the fury
By the fury, no!

And still for you it's not too late
Don't draw your sword
Just use your wisdom
And never let this be your fate
Oh, no, it's here again
This demon loves the pain

No, it's burning like a flame
Now nothing seems the same
I've lost control of mind and body
My soul is in its hand
Its wish is my command
Enslaved forever by the fury, no!
No, it's burning like a flame
Now nothing seems the same
I've lost control of mind and body
My soul is in its hand
Its wish is my command
Enslaved forever by the fury
By the fury
By the fury, no!Embed
