3 ContributorsTroops of Tomorrow Lyrics
We're troops of tomorrow
We're hanging round today
We're playin' tough music
'Cause it's hard times honey

We need a new solution
We want it quick
We're getting frustrated
It's makin' us sick

We ain't got a bright future
We bought it on the never-never
Don't wanna be city prisoners
We ain't gonna live forever

We're troops of tomorrow
We're hanging round today
We're playin' tough music
'Cause it's hard times honey

We gotta stop that dreaming
We gotta pick up that gun
We're troops of tomorrow
We got a new vision
You might also like
I said we're troops of tomorrow
I said we're troops of tomorrow
I said we're troops of tomorrow
I said we're troops of tomorrow
I said we're troops of tomorrow
I said we're troops of tomorrow
I said we're troops of tomorrowEmbed
