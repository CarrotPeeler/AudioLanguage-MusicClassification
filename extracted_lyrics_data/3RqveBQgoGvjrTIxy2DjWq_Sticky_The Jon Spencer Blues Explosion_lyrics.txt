Lover
I been thinkin' 'bout you
I can't forget that
(ad lib)
All ady I don't care what they say
I don't care what they say
I don't care what they say
It's early in the mornin'
In the midnight hour in Atlanta
How can I love you?
I love you
I love you
I love you
I got to
I love you
I got to all nightYou might also likeEmbed
