7 ContributorsSoul Disintegration LyricsWhat a waste, deception hangs
In the balance, we create
Our only hope is the truth
A bitter fate, it satiates, primal and carnal, last embrace
Turns the innocence to ruin
Answer to the call of an unknown force
Given all I could, still but you want more
See, I'm not like you, Soul disintegration!
Looking for the key to unlock the doors
With every single dream, when it's run its course
See, I'm not like you, Soul Disintegration!
Inhuman race, a different faith
For our survival, we create
Our afflictions, we are fools
A docile state, we medicate, snuff out emotions, it's too late
We're confined without a clue
Answer to the call of an unknown force
Given all I could, still but you want more
See, I'm not like you, Soul disintegration!
Looking for the key to unlock the doors
With every single dream, when it's run its course
See, I'm not like you, Soul Disintegration!

I won't take it anymore
You're dead inside my heart
I won't take it anymore
(I'm no prisoner)
You're dead inside my heart
I won't take it anymore
You're dead inside my heart
I won't take it anymore
(I'm no prisoner)
Rely on weakness, the strong will rise and overcome
Injustice is hate, words fall on deaf ears and the poor
Answer to the call of an unknown force
Given all I could, still but you want more
See, I'm not like you, Soul disintegration!
Looking for the key to unlock the doors
With every single dream, when it's run its course
See, I'm not like you, Soul Disintegration!Embed
