You can hear it if you try
Our message rides along the rising tide
Clear to the other side
The message echoes through the valleys
Reflecting off the mountains high
Out over deserts, through the canyons deep
Here's a gift for you to keep

Here is a message in the song
Tell you the message, sing along
Let's pull together now and every time
There's a chance we will survive
The message speaks in every city
In every village, every town
To all that worry of this troubled way
We can change it all today

Here is a message in the song
Tell you the message, sing along
Let's pull together now and every time
There's a chance we will survive
Become one (repeat 10x)You might also likeEmbed
