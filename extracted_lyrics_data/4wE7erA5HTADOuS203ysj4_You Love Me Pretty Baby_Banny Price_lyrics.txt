I love you baby with all of my love
I love you baby with all of my love
I love you baby with all of my love

Do you love me pretty baby?
All my love is true
Do you love me pretty baby?
No one else will ever do
I love you baby
What more can I do


Do you love me pretty baby?
All my love is true
Do you love me pretty baby?
No one else will ever do
I love you baby
What more can I do
