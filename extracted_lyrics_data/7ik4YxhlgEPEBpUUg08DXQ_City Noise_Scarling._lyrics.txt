6 ContributorsCity Noise Lyrics
Another crowded dance floor, another empty glass
Another failed hello
It's your alibi, another splendid lie
It's the bruises that you can't show
It's another lonely sunset, another starless sky
The nervousness inside
It's the final kiss from a lover's fist
It's the reason why you can't cry

It's a violent reaction, the mixtape in your heart
The answer you should know
How we complicate a simple mistake
It's the face you make when I go

And we tried to change, the city noise made us strange
So we plugged our ears and learned to fight
We set the stage, but we could not engage
So we cut all ties by candlelight
Change, change, change

Another deep depression, the calm before the storm
The shaking in your head
How you sacrificed, how you paid the price
All the words you wish you had said
It's the rawest of emotions, drinking to forget
Names written in the snow
It's the anxious feel, purging your last meal
It's the secret that you can't know
You might also like
And we tried to change, the city noise made us strange
So we plugged our ears and learned to fight
We set the stage, but we could not engage
So we cut all ties by candlelight
Change, change, change

Change, change
Change, change, change

And we tried to change, the city noise made us strange
So we plugged our ears and learned to fight
We set the stage, but we could not engage
So we cut all ties by candlelight
Change, change, changeEmbed
