2 ContributorsLong Is the Time, Hard Is the Road LyricsBig old snake o' red tail lights
Lookin' for a drain
Pretty red, like diamond bright
Become your ball and chain
If you ever reach the other side
It will never be this way
They tie you down with your own high hopes
You better listen what I say
Long is the time, and hard is the road
Everybody lookin' for a place
To put down their heavy load
Fat cat screamin' up above
'cause he don't get no second chance
He's passing down his reckless fear
He kick your chains and make you dance
Dance around his daydream
'till he gets to fly away
You find a dagger in your back
You better listen what I say
Long is the time, and hard is the road
Everybody lookin' for a place
To put down their heavy load
You might also likeOh, long is the time and hard is the road
Hard is the road

Oh, long is the time and hard is the road
Everybody lookin' for a place
To put down their heavy load
Long is the time, and hard is the roadEmbed
