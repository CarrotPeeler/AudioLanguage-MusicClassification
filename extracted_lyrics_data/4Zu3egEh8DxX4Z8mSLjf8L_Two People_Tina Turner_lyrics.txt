10 ContributorsTwo People Lyrics
Two people living on the edge of life
Are people running out of dreams and time

I can hear it when you tell me so
And I can feel it but I can't let go

Two people got to stick together
And love one another, save it for a rainy day
Some people got to stay whatever
And give one another shelter on a rainy day

Two people living in the way we do
Are people trying to keep a love anew

What to say to make some sense of it
And what to do to make the feeling fit

Two people got to stick together
And love one another, save it for a rainy day
Some people got to stay whatever
And give one another shelter on a rainy day
You might also like
I'll come running to your rescue
You gotta stand by me
There's a lot of love between us
And we should never let go, oh

Two people got to stick together
And love one another, save it for a rainy day
Some people got to stay whatever
And give one another shelter on a rainy day
Two people got to stick together
And love one another, save it for a rainy day
Some people got to stay whatever
And give one another shelter on a rainy day
Two people got to stick together
And love one another, save it for a rainy day
Some people got to stay whatever
And give one another shelter on a rainy day

Two people, stick together
One another, save it for a rainy day
Some people stay whateverEmbed
