8 ContributorsTwilight Zone/Twilight Tone Lyrics”With a key, you unlock a door to imagination. Beyond it is another dimension. A dimension of sight, a dimension of sound, a dimension of mind. You're moving through a land of both shadow and substance of things and ideas, guiding you through this wondrous journey is the hypnotic sound of the Twilight Tone.”
When I hear this melody
This strange illusion takes over me
Through a tunnel of the mind
Perhaps a present or future time oh, oh
Out of nowhere comes this sound
This melody that keeps spinning 'round and 'round
Pyramidal locomotion
From this mystic unknown zone
Here in the twilight
Here in the twilight
Twilight tone
An unpretentious girl from Memphis
Saw the future through her third eye
People came with skepticism
Picking, testing her precision, no, oh, oh, oh
Suddenly they heard this sound
This melody that keeps spinning 'round and 'round
A signpost up ahead is coming
From this mystic unknown zone
Here in the twilight (Twilight swept away, feelin' the rhythm)
Here in the twilight (Twilight swept away)
Here in the twilight
Twilight tone
You might also like
Here in the twilight (Twilight swept away, feelin' the rhythm)
Here in the twilight (Twilight swept away)
Here in the twilight
Twilight tone
“Submitted for your approval. When Mr. Miller, who's about to take a trip into oddness and obsolescence through a zone whose boundaries are that of imagination. Accompanying him on this journey is the mesmerizing sound of the Twilight Tone.”
On a cold and rainy night
When Mr. Miller had a rare flight
Glenn was up there boppin' a rhythm
Then the engine stopped to listen with him play that beat, oh, oh
Suddenly he heard this sound
This melody that keeps spinning 'round and 'round
Now he resides and plays trombone
In the mystic unknown zone
Here in the twilight (repeat many times)
