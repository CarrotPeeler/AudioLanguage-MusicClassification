1 ContributorIntern. Virus. Human LyricsSelf-improvized gods
Madness on that brain grows
Lack of conscience shown
A fate, a shame
For an
Nerve-cells off
Bones not tough
Lack of conscience shown
A fate, a shame
Theories building
A mess in the head
And the death in the veins
For an
Intern
Virus
Human
Agony of a race
Procreate to erase
Fear of death
Clearing palce
Bodies lamed
You might also likeInoculate the hate
You will never betray
This is the end
We're all waiting as lambs
Slim and rotting in bed
Breath and regurgitate
Holes are draining blood
Therapy, we feel insane
Demolish, we medicate
Purity, many to blame
Feverish, the fluids away
Raising up more bacterias
Spreading the cells in vaginas
Over the edge, we fail
Feeling a rain
Inside a drain
Intern
Virus
Human
Maculating shirts like monkeys
Dignity that falls hiding well
Epidermic moist that shivers
Nothing seems lost for believersEmbed
