6 ContributorsThe Bottle LyricsClimb in, climb in, climb inside me
Pain
Climb in, climb in, climb inside me
Pain
Another night of drinking, another night of being
Out of my head and I don't know where I was last night
Drinking on a empty stomach or an empty mind
It makes no difference when I'm way out of line
Things I can't remember come back to haunt me
A lot of people out there who seem to want me
Climb in the bottle and never come out
Climb in, climb in, climb inside me
Pain
Climb in, climb in, climb inside me
Pain
I may know nothing but I'm good at something
I will drink 'til the sun comes up no more
One of these days gonna come out of my haze
Better hurry up, it's getting harder to come back
Things I can't remember come back to haunt me
A lot of people out there who seem to want me
Climb in the bottle and never come out
