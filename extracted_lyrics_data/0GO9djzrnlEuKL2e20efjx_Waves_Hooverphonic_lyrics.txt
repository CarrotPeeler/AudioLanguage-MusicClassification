3 ContributorsWaves LyricsThese gigantic waves just take me
To an unknown destination
Under the moonlight
Feel free to join me on my trip
The tide will take us far
Beyond midnight
Stars will guide us through this
Exotic white
Stars won't be able to fool the knowledge
Of the magic dice
This sea breeze is refreshing
While the dolphins sing about
These psychedelic moods
These waves keep you going
'Till you finally forget
Your original roots
Stars will guide us through this
Exotic white
Stars won't be able to fool the knowledge
Of the magic dice
Wave after wave
Wave after wave
Wave after wave
Wave after wave
Wave after wave
Wave after wave
Wave after wave
Wave after wave
Wave after wave
