And I'm gonna live the high life
The very same thing all the fortunate have found
The world on a string
The high life
Black light, black heat
Who can resist?
It flows through time
It slows like this
That strange little bird makes a melancholy sound
And I'm gonna live the high life
It has been said that there's nothing to profound
As living it well, the high life
As living it well, the high lifeYou might also likeEmbed
