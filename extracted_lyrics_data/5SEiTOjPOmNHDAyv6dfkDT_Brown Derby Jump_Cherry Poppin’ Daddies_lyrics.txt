(Jump jump jump!)
(Jump!)
(Jump jump jump!)
She was a woman of mystery
And what she wanted I could not see
A three-year trip on the dragon
'Til the clinic had to get me clean
We were a party and always drunk
Before I knew it, the wreck had sunk
Shake, trip, shimmy and you do the bump
Everybody's swingin' to the Brown Derby Jump
(Jump!)
(Jump jump jump!)
The beautiful life is always damned
You gotta fall into the quicksand
A deadly kiss from a temptress can
Serve to make a truly wayward man
She's not a talker, her teeth are fixed
But she's a looker that lives for kicks
A nightmare straight from an Otto Dix
Everybody's swingin' with the Brown Derby chicks

A-do the jump (jump!)

I've come a long way and now I'm me
The darkest river that meets the sea
And all those lights on the harbor seem
To be sparklin' in bittersweet
I'm a survivor my heart is tough
I'm hangin' in there and that's enough
Shake, trip, shimmy and we'd do the bump
Everybody's swingin' to the
Brown Derby Jump

A-do the jump (jump!)
