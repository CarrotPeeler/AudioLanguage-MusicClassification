Lips are turning blue
A kiss that can't renew
I only dream of you, my beautiful
Tiptoe to your room (Tiptoe to your room)
A starlight in the gloom (A starlight in the gloom)
I only dream of you (Of you, dream of you)
And you never knew (And you never knew)

Sing for absolution
I will be singing
And falling from your grace, ooh

There's nowhere left to hide
And no one to confide
The truth burns deep inside and will never die
Lips are turning blue (Lips are turning blue)
A kiss that can't renew (A kiss that can't renew)
I only dream of you (Of you, dream of you)
My beautiful (My beautiful)

Sing for absolution
I will be singing
And falling from your grace, hey
You might also like

Sing for absolution
I will be singing
And falling from your grace, yeah
Our wrongs remain unrectified
And our souls won't be exhumed13Embed
