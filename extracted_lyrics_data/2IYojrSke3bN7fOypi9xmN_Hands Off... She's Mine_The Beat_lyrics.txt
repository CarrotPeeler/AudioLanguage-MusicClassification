He told me that he liked you too
But then I saw him kissing you
I could've died when he said, hands off she's mine
Said hands off she's mine
Hands off she's mine
Hands off she's mine, I want her all the time
Hands off she's mine, hands off she's mine
I knew that this was real although
It usually comes mixed up with fear
I knew that I could wait
Although it just might take a thousand years
Said hands off she's mine
Hands off she's mine
Hands off she's mine, until the end of time
Hands off she's mine, hands off she's mine
La, la, la, la
La, la, la, la
La, la, la, la
La, la, la, la
Now we're going steady, been together several weeks
I check out all the other guys who we see on the streets
When I say, hands off she's mine
Hands off she's mine
Hands off she's mine, it takes up all my time
Hands off she's mine, hands off she's mine

I tell ya get yer hands off me DAUGHTER
C'mon mek me said don't mess around on ya
C'mek mek me tell ya don't want ta get ya
La, la, la, la
La, la, la, la
La, la, la, la
La, la, la, la
Funny how the best things never last for every day
I thought she was my girlfriend
'Till I heard that someone else was saying
Hands off she's mine. Hands off she's mine
Hands off she's mine. Hands off she's mine
Hands off she's mine. Hands off she's mine
Hands off she's mine. Hands off she's mine
Hands off she's mine. Hands off she's mine
Hands off she's mineEmbed
