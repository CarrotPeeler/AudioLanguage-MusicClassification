1 ContributorMidnight Sun LyricsCascade, earthquake
My quest is callin' me
I'm made, I break
Sting like a honey bee
Velvet, princely
Too late to disagree
Gauntlet, you flee
God speed your symphony
Knife edge, restless
Inside do test my nerve
High ledge, timeless
Slowly yet I serve
I sleep in the midnight sun
In shade I rest
With my saffron
I weep in the midnight sun
This last parade
I face the dawn
Out here in the midnight sun
I'm miles away
And I am gone
And I taste the cinnamon
On my way to Avalon
You might also likeRefused, no sin
Outside the devil lurks
Confused, tailspin
We ride, we make it work
I sleep in the midnight sun
In shade I rest
With my saffron
I weep in the midnight sun
This last parade
I face the dawn
Out here in the midnight sun
I'm miles away
And I am gone
And I taste the cinnamon
On my way to Avalon
I sleep in the midnight sun
In shade I rest
With my saffron
I weep in the midnight sun
This last parade
I face the dawn
Out here in the midnight sun
I'm miles away
And I am gone
And I taste the cinnamon
On my way to Avalon
I'm on my way, I'm on my wayEmbed
