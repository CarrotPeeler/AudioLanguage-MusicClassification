Good enough
So we all
Feel the edge of our imperfection
Let a long day
Hear you all out man
Let your eyes see
A goal in the distance
Tell them now we stay forever
Tell them now we stay forever
Good enough
Good enough
So we all
Hit the dirt
Will we ever stop falling?
Tell them now we stay forever
Tell them now we stay forever
I am failure
I am flaw (not sure that we can make it)
I am fine
Fight for now
Tell them now we stay forever
Tell them now we stay forever

Good enough
So we all
It was just not good enough

Let the sunday weigh all the weight man
Let the corners of your bed tell the story
Tell them now we stay forever
Tell them now we stay forever
I am failure
I am flaw (not sure that we can make it)
I am fine
Fight for now
Tell them now we stay forever
Tell them now we stay forever
Tell them now we stay forever
Tell them now we stay forever
I am fine
Tell them now we stay forever
Tell them now we stay forever
Tell them now we stay forever
Tell them now we stay forever
Tell them now we stay forever
Tell them now we stay forever
Tell them now we stay forever
Tell them now we stay forever
Tell them now we stay forever
Tell them now we stay forever
Tell them now we stay forever
I am fineEmbed
