3 ContributorsThe Hardest Part Lyrics
Let it fill your heart
And throw it all over
Like a flower
Into the water

Let it fill your heart
Let it blow you all over
When you tumble
Under the water

What's to come of my life
Dreaming days away

And that's the hardest part
Of it all for you
To live your life
With nothing at all

And that's the hardest part
Of it all for you
To live your life
With nothing at all
You might also like
Let me fill your heart
Let me warm you all over
Let me hear your laughter
Run through the water

Let me fill your heart
Let it blossom all over
Like a petal
Burning the water

I'll spend the rest of my life
Walking through the rain

And that's the hardest part
Of it all for you
To live your life
With nothing at all

And that's the hardest part
Of it all for you
To live your life
With nothing at all

I'll spend the rest of my life
And my waking days

And that's the hardest part
Of it all for you
To live your life
With nothing at all

And that's the hardest part
Of it all for you
To live your life
With nothing at all

And that's the hardest part
Of it all for you
To live your life
With nothing at all

And that's the hardest part
Of it all for you
To live your life
With nothing at all
And that's the hardest part
Of it all for you
To live your life
With nothing at all

And that's the hardest part
Of it all for you
To live your life
With nothing at allEmbed
