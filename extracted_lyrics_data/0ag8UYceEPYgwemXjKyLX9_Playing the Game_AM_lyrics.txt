1 ContributorPlaying the Game LyricsGive me something to talk about
Take your time
Tell me something to do without
Ill wait in line
I don't know
What to say
Move along
Anyway
Take it slow
Lonely road
Is the path
That I seem to follow
All I want to do is be true to my ways
Leaning back and forward were playing the game
All this pain I've cause you I know it by name
Taking this ticket walking away
Taking all that has come and gone
You know were wrong
Watching everyone hum along
Were still untold
Fall in love
Let it go
I don't know
What its for
Take a stand
Falling down
Dig on in
Cause its all that you've got nowYou might also likeEmbed
