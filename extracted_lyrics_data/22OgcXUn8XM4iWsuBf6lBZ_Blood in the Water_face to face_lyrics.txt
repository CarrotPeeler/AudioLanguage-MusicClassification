1 ContributorBlood in the Water LyricsWhats your name? (what's your name?)
Whats your name?
I don't care
I don't think it means a thing any more
Still the same
Still the same
Till you walk with your foot out the door
Everybody wants to take a little piece you're faking
You know better than the rest when it's someone else but you
It's like suddenly you are everybody's friend
And it's ending as soon as it begins
It's like blood is in the water once again
You have been bleeding in this place for so long
Congratulations you are the one (hey!)
There is so much work to be done (hey!)
I promise we can have our fun (hey!)
You give everything or you will have nothing left
What's the game? (what's the game?)
What's the game?
Are you are aware you don't know a single thing anymore
It's a shame (it's a shame)
It's a shame
I used to think you were better but I can tell anymore
Everybody takes a piece if they can
You know better than the rest when they want someone else but you
You might also likeIt's like suddenly you are everybody's friend
And it's ending as soon as it begins
It's like blood is in the water once again
You've been bleeding in this place for long
Congratulations you are the one
There is so much work to be done
I promise we can have our fun
You will have nothing left
So what's your name?
So what's your name?Embed
