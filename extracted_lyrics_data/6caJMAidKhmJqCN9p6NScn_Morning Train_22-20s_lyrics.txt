2 ContributorsMorning Train LyricsNothing exists
Just you and me and hollowness
Walking to the deadline
Nothing is fixed
We swallow words like razorblades
Closer to the deadline
And there's so much I could say
But it's too late now we're running out of time
Between the doorway and the morning train
To dark from the light
Only I could find a way
Only I could guide us
To darkness from the light
Only I could find a way
Only I could guide us
And there's so much I should say
But it's no use now we're running out of time
Between the doorway and the morning train
And there's so much I'd like to say
But apologies don't fit the time or place
Between the doorway and the morning train
Now I'm going, now I'm going down the line
Now I'm going, now I'm going down the line
Leaving pain again
You might also likeAnd there's so much I'd like to say
But it's too late now there isn't time or space
Between the doorway and the morning train
And there's so much I'd like to say
But we're running out of time
And we're running out of space
And this kiss leaves such a sour aftertaste
Between the platform and the morning trainEmbed
