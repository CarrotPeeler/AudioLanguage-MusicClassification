1 ContributorFallacy LyricsIrresistable
Unconceivable
Not locatable
Undefinable
Is there truth to this?
Can I live with this?
Can I die without?
Is there any doubt?
Luresia, no salvation
Luresia, the last temptation
I have faith in me
I know what you see
Are you happy now?
Did you enjoy the show?
Here comes my surprise
Death for lullabies
If you think I am mad
Look at the life I had
Your nature is so demanding
When will you let me go
Your spell is so destructive
Your beauty out of reach
You might also likeIs your faith enough to prove me wrong?
Are you ghost enough to overcome?Embed
