With pride we'll walk all over you
Steel grip, we'll hold you down
On a leash, we're coming through
Metal teeth, a diamond smile
Mechanical jaws, a two ton bite
With winter frost, an atomic pile
We stand the ground where the big dog's fight
Divine inferno, hell on ice
Heaven's burning, sacrifice
Divine inferno, hell on ice
Heaven's burning, sacrifice
Your God sent us to destroy
Your God sent us to destroy
Your God sent us to destroy
Your God sent us to destroy
You
Nuclear war, behind glass walls
We long for the storm, we stray from our path
Feel the walls, closing in
Chasing our trails, we're feeding our wrath

Heaven's burning, sacrifice
