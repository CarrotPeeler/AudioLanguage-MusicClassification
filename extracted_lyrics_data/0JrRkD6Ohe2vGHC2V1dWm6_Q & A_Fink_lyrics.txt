2 ContributorsQ & A LyricsPeople wanna know just how old I was when I left home
People wanna know just how old I was when I hit the road
People wanna know just how old I was when I left the comfort zone
People wanna know, gotta walk a mile in my moccasins
They wanna know, they wanna know if it's paying dividends
And if it's time well spent
Find out at the end
Of the Q & A
It is only time we're spending
On a happy ending
To Q & A
People wanna know if I'm having big fun
I don't care of your feet hurt no no
You gotta run, you gotta run
And is it time well spent?
Find out where it went
Of the Q & A
It is only time we're spending
On a happy ending
To Q & A
What you wanna know?
