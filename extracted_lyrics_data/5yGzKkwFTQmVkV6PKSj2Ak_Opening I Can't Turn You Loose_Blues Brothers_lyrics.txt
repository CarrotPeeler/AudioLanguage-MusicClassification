Well, here it is the late 1970's going on 1985
Y'know so much of the music we here today is pre-programmed electronic disco, we never get a chance to hear master blues men practicing their craft anymore
By the year 2006, the music known today as the blues will exist only in the classical records department of your local public library
So tonight, Ladies and Gentlemen, while we still can, let us welcome from Rock Island, Illinois, the blues men of Joliet Jake and Elwood Blues
