Maybe it's the love, the drugs, the weed, the pussy
Maybe it's all the above, maybe I don't need a hug
Maybe I'm just fucked up
Maybe it's the love, the drugs, the weed, the pussy
Maybe it's all the above, maybe I don't need a hug
Maybe I'm just fucked up

I wanna have more threesomes but you're so territorial
I can't even kick it 'cause you watching my story though
I got ones you seen and I've got some you don't need to know
I done gave more dick than a little
I know I'm the reason that you freaky now
You wish you could be the reason that I settle down
You done gave me all I wanted but I still got
Reasons I should fuck around, I should fuck around

Maybe it's the love, the drugs, the weed, the pussy
Maybe it's all the above, maybe I don't need a hug
Maybe I'm just fucked up
Maybe it's the love, the drugs, the weed, the pussy
Maybe it's all the above, maybe I don't need a hug
Maybe I'm just fucked up (Mm, uh)
Maybe it's all the above

Said, said
I said, "A thot gon' be thot", so I'm like, "Fuck these bitches"
My son got a mother and I love her so it's different
I'm here for one night, so baby girl, what you sippin'?
I'm on some bullshit, my '94 Scottie Pippen
So save the last dance for when I'm drunk and when I'm hittin'
Your boyfriend lame, that boy pussy, that boy kitten
Like, meow, come home to me now
It's me and my niggas, we lit and we wild
Yeah, and we don't care how you feel inside
It's me and my niggas, fuck the other side
This is something like murder, no it's genocide
You niggas living lies, this is civilized
Be careful who you judge and who you criticize
It's all being a people person when they're killing mines
Hard times, sendin' cold chills down my spine
It's dark now, at sunrise I was feelin' fine
Nothin' on my mind, I swear I didn't wanna die
I'm outside on my grind, I don't believe in time
All these haters clockin' me, these diamonds leave 'em blind
Jealousy and envy, I swear that I'm reading minds
Baby momma called, sayin', "Yeah, you actin' different"
All these drugs and these hoes got you fuckin' trippin'
I made a million on the road, you'll be happy Christmas
Sayin' I would stay down but you know I didn't, yeah
Maybe it's the love, the drugs, the weed, the pussy
Maybe it's all the above, maybe I don't need a hug
Maybe I'm just fucked up
Maybe it's the love, the drugs, the weed, the pussy
Maybe it's all the above, maybe I don't need a hug
Maybe I'm just fucked up (Mm, uh)
Maybe it's all the above1Embed
