What's the point in watching all my friends die?
What's the point in singing these old fucking lines?
Thirty-three vertebrae, yet no sign of backbone
I guess I knew one day I'd find myself all alone
"God's in his Heaven. All's right with the world."

My disposition to existence
Never coping with the distance
I paved my road to hell
Fuck, I'll admit it
Countless days spent dreaming of death
Because together we had nothing left
(We have nothing left)
This always ends in a forced exit
This grave was ours until you left it

Separate the skin from my bones
Satiate the hell we called home
And if you'd rather die on your own
Suffocate my soul before you go
You might also like「あんたバカァ？」
My malice aforethought, let my dreams rot
Everything you need is everything I'm not
Everything you need is all for naught
Everything you need is everything I'm not
The past is never dead
Once again, in the end, all I see are seas of red
What's the point in watching all my friends die?
What's the point in living through another night?

I think that you are the same as me
Ripping old wounds to see
If your heart's finally
Fucking done bleeding
I've been burning in water and drowning in flame
Every day since has been third-degree pain
I'm all that's left, so who takes the blame?
Heaven without you is hell all the same
I feel the seven eyes still watching me
Send down your best
So you can watch them
Angels reign over me
Preying in the dark
Feeding our agony
Angels reign over me
Send down your best
So you can watch them bleedEmbed
