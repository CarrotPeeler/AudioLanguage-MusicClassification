Maybe just rearranged
Tomorrow will be different
New day new commitment
Love is all I ever want for you
Love is all I ever wanted too
Too much anger is the passion over
Sorry just won't cut it anymore
So I'm drinking again
Lie awake not sleeping
Constantly reliving
Questioning regretting
Love is all I ever want for you
Love is all I ever wanted too
Too much anger is the passion over
Sorry just won't cut it anymore
Say I didn't mean to hurt you I just wasn't thinking
Caught up in my world and now it's gone it's gone it's gone
Facing all my past I want to say I am okay now
Can't hold on so tight I want to say I am okay now
When will I be fine at all
You might also likeSo this must be the first day I've started
Will this feeling ever go away from me
Try to push myself each day to care
Will this feeling ever go away
Too much anger is the passion over
Sorry just won't cut it anymore
Now I'm faced with myself and my feelings
Can't blame anybody elseEmbed
