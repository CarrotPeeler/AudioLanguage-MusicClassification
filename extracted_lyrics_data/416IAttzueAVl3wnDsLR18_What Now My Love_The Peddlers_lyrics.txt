1 ContributorSlip Lyrics(yeah da da da)

Its been a while since I've felt like this
I've been waiting for someone like this
To come along and rewrite my script
It's been raining for a long time
And the puddle's right here

So I slip right in
So I slip right in
So I slip right in
So I slip right in (yeah)

She's a dragon, the wings she's got
With fire in her words
And everything sounds like music, coming out of vocal chords
And every single thing about her is dragging me towards
An endless well of affection and dreams

So I slip right in
So I slip right in
So I slip right in
So I slip right in (yeah)

(ah ah de da de da)
Ice skate waves bring slip pip pitter
Ice skate waves for her tight grip slippers
Get drenched cause I sweat water while we step
Drip drip I can't fall in love but I slip slip
Lips, Fiji, Voss, Evian, and I thought that my kiss was all possum Catfish 
Love is a raindrop, coming though the mist though
Clothes Stickin 'to my back and rain with my fist though
Hydroplanin' down hill, splashin' through your meadow
Splashin' in the ocean now we're smokin' through her VSCO
Windshiled wipers, spent  rearview steamed up sloppy
Thats was  why I couldn't see a 12 right on me
Woop woop, pulled me over son
'You were going over 80, in a residential on a day far too rainy, so what you say now bud?'
'I was late on my way to go meet my love!'
He said 'okay', skrreted way in the name of love
Now I'm slippin' off her  and I feel so safe (yeah) 

So I slip right in
So I slip right in
So I slip right in
So I slip right in (yeah)

And its' been too long
Since the last time you came
I miss being in love
This beautiful gameee
So I slip right in
So I slip right in
So I slip right in
So I slip right in (yeah)Embed
