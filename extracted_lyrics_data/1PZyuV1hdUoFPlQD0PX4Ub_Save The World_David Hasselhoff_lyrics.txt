1 ContributorSave The World Lyrics(Taylor-Ann Hasselhoff)
Daddy, why do children cry ?
Can't you make it better ?
Take a look around the world
See the tears in children's eyes
Make it better and give them all your love
I see no reason for hunger and pain
Be aware we're all the same
Let's come together for a better life - right now
Now it's time to make changes
That millions are hoping for
There's a way if we all lend our hands
To the lost and poor
Save the world - save our lives
Stop the fear in children's eyes
Give your love - heal the need
Save the dreams for you and me
There's a light to guide the way
If you try to save the world
Make a choice help them with lovin' care
You might also likeNow it's time that we have to do
Something to change the world
Stop pretending and let love lights shine -
For peace on earth
Save the world - save our lives
Stop the fear in children's eyes
Give your love - heal the need
Save the dreams for you and me
Save the world - save our lives
Stop the fear in children's eyes
Give your love - heal the need
Save the dreams for you and me
