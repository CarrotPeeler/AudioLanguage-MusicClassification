5 ContributorsBe Mine Tonight Lyrics
Asian cigarettes
A long talk
A few cans
If you can
Be my bare skinned baby
We're in for a long night a strong night
You
Look what you've done to me
You lit me
You bit me I'm rapt
Oh
You
Look what you've done to me
You lit me
You bit me I'm rapt

Be mine
Be mine tonight (be mine tonight)
Oh come on Come on
Another smoke
Another can
Another conversation
Maybe
You might also like
I knew you
Not long
I knew you
You're so strong

Asian cigarettes
A long talk
A few cans
If you can

Be mine
Be mine tonight (be mine tonight)
All night
Another smoke
Another can
Another talk maybe
You

I knew you
Not long
I knew you
You're so strong
Asian cigarettes
A long talk
A few cans
If you can
Be mine
Be mine tonight

I knew you
Not long
I knew you
You're so strong
So strongEmbed
