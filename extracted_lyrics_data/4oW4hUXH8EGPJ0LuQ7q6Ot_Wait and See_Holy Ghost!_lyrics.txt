4 ContributorsWait And See Lyrics
In the train
Oh, I hate how you make me feel
Not the same
In the blink of an eyelid
The island changed too
Now the problems with me are in you

In the cut
In the heart of the darkness
I feel as though
I feel dark, I feel heartless
Are you feeling rough too?
Now the problems with me are in you

When you promised to be honest with me
Were you being honest?
Tell me honestly
‘Cause you got me worried, worried, worried
I guess I'll have to wait, I guess I'll have to wait and see

Way too young
You’re the kind that is fine without
Anyone
‘Cause the night is the time where
I meet the glove of
The father who guards her from love
You might also like
Way too late
Oh, I hate how you make me
But I wait and wait
And I guess I feel lately
That I'm in a state too
Now the problems with me are in you

When you promised to be honest with me
Were you being honest?
Tell me honestly
‘Cause you got me worried, worried, worried
I guess I'll have to wait, I guess I'll have to wait and see1Embed
