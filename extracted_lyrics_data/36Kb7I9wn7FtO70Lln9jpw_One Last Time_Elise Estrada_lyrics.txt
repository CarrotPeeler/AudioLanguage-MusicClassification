1 ContributorOne Last Time LyricsIt'd be easier if there was someone else
I might understand if we had had a fight
And we're lying here but you're somewhere else
I don't wanna see what you don't feel
So just turn off the lights
I know you try but your heart ain't gonna fake it
If it ain't love theres no way I can take it
So exposed
Might as well be naked
Baby I've been praying
But I just can't make you love me
And it burns my heart
That you don't feel the flame
No, I just can't make you love me
So hold me like you mean it, and I'll pretend you feel it
One last time
Don't say the word
Baby, please don't speak
Just hold me close and let me make believe
I don't wanna hurt till the morning breaks
Just pretend it's the end and spend one last night with me
You might also likeI know you try but your heart ain't gonna fake it
If it ain't love theres no way I can take it
So exposed
Might as well be naked
Baby I've been praying
But I just can't make you love me
And it burns my heart
That you don't feel the flame
No, I just can't make you love me
So hold me like you mean it, and I'll pretend you feel it
One last time
I know it's no one's fault
That it's just not there for you
That you can't make your heart feel the way I feel for you
It's alright to keep on hanging on
Just give me one more night before we both move on
But I just can't make you love me
And it burns my heart
That you don't feel the flame
No, I just can't make you love me
So hold me like you mean it, and I'll pretend you feel it
But I just can't make you love me, and it burns my heart that you don't feel the flame
No I just can't make you love you
So hold me like you mean it and I'll pretend you feel it
One Last timeEmbed
