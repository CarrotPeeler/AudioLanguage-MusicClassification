Gently my eyelids close
I'd rather be good than clever
I'd rather have all facts wrong
Than no reply whatever
I learned before I could speak
With those "being patient eyes"
When God created my kind
But he forgot to tell me why
So gently my eyelids close..

All alone, all alone at home I sit
I'm (I-I'm) very tired of it (All alone)
Burn the midnight oil or pour it on my salad (I-I-I)
I lost the thread I thought I had

Led by hearts and ears
Memory lagging behind
No shame being a fool
I got many things on my mind
Pick up the phone on first ring
I never get out anymore
There's nowhere to go, but back
And there's quicksand outside my door
So gently my eyelids close
You might also like
All alone, all alone at home I sit
I'm (I-I'm) very tired of it (All alone)
Burn the midnight oil or pour it on my salad (I-I-I)
I lost the thread I thought I had

I lost it - I lost it, yeah

 mio, muchacha, se√±orita, woo

Is that a shadow - or a hole in the floor?
And what's that noise outside my door??
Home alone, on my own. and all alone...

All alone, all alone at home I sit
I'm (I-I'm) very tired of it (All alone)
Burn the midnight oil or pour it on my salad (I-I-I)
I lost the thread I thought I had
I lost the thread
All alone, all alone at home I sit
I'm (I-I'm) very tired of it (All alone)
Burn the midnight oil or pour it on my salad (I-I-I)
I lost the thread I thought I had
I lost the thread I thought I had
YeahEmbed
