1 ContributorScream for Me LyricsDon't say I'm an angel
I don't confess that I'm a saint
I wouldn't say that I'm welcome
'Cause, baby, you know that I ain't
People tell you I'm wicked
Your mamma says that I'm mean
They'll tell you I'm up to no good
But I'm the best that you've ever seen
So won't you scream for me?
Scream 'til it hurts
Cry for me
A river of tears
Bleed for me
Most women do
Scream for me
Teacher says that I'm a devil's child
And mischief is the game that I play
They say I'm nothin' but trouble
I wouldn't have it any other way
Now, mammas, tell all your children
Behave to the goldеn rule
Never, nеver talk to strangers
To wise men, sheep, or fools
You might also likeCome on, scream for me
Scream 'til it hurts
Cry for me
A river of tears
Bleed for me
Most women do
Come on and scream for me
Scream
Let me hear ya
Scream
Don't you call me the angel
Don't you say that I'm that saint
And don't you tell me I'm welcome
'Cause, baby, you know that I ain't
Teacher says that I'm a devil's child
And mischief is the game that I play (So true)
They say I'm nothin' but trouble
I wouldn't have it any other way
Come on, scream for me
Scream 'til it hurts
Cry for me
A river of tears
Bleed for me
Most women do
Scream for me, scream
Scream for me
Scream 'til it hurts
Cry for me
A river of tears
Bleed for me
Most women do
Come on and scream for me
Let me hear ya
