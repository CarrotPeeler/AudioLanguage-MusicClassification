2 ContributorsMary-Anne LyricsEveryday now seems endless
How slow the moments go but how fast they'll fly
The next time I see Mary-Anne
All my sorrows soon will leave me
Then the sadder world will seem like new
The next time I see Mary-Anne
Mary-Anne, there are no words that I could say
No way to tell her what it means to me
To see her face again
In the sunlight I'll kiss her
Married, we will be my baby and me
The next time I see Mary-Anne
The next time I see Mary-Anne, Mary-AnneYou might also likeEmbed
