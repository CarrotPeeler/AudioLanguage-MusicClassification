1 ContributorY’all Feel That? LyricsY’all feel that?
Erykah Badu voice my soul (sole) on the track this is real rap
But What’s real? we basing all our goals on the apps just to fill that
Hole deep inside we putting coal in our sack it’s time to heal that
All this bending over backwards takes a toll on my back time to kill that
And be free
From self-imposed boxes still learning to be me
This my master class
On breaking molds of any plaster cast
Say it with my chest to make a faster pass
Through you ears shit and off the glass
I'm trynna win mills (windmill) earn leverage
Ain’t trynna be out fighting for my masters back
Bassinets open Baby Boy about to answer that
Call from God my purpose through thesе words (where my pastor hat)
A wise man told mе
Never listen to a nigga out here claiming he wise
Or that he one of them guys
That can lead you up the mountain for a piece of the pie
I know you only find yo guide when you looking inside
The music bigger than I so Fuck the ego and pride
I do this shit for all my folks yelling what up to Fried
Filling every bar with hope hoping we stay from behind
It’s time to tap into yo greatness fuck just trynna survive
Know it ain’t easy I tr...
No it ain’t easy I’ve tried
I Know it ain’t easy I try
And I'm still trying to hold my weight
Its time for actions to finally catch up with my faith
I run my race
Unbothered by the speed of the cars
No more happy hours where they ask me if I work at the bar
Bitch I’m a star
Or More like prepared to be
Understand my words will live long after they bury me
And that my flow refreshing more hydrating than cerave
Yet when my eyelids meet I see success and it’s scaring me
Like damn nigga
Is all of this part of the plan nigga?
Should i take these risks before I can point out some fans nigga?
Damn nigga
Chasing a dream running in sand nigga
Should’ve stayed the course You’d be on ya way to some (bands nigga)
Nah
I’m head first going DDT
Chasing the feeling of seeing “WE ACCEPT EBT”
Signs in the windows
As a kid no Nintendo
Only switches from kinfolk
And casual innuendos
This
You might also likeIs where I’m proving
You trust yourself when going through it
Then you can do it
You don’t follow heart you end up ruined
Is life picture perfect if you not the one that drew it?
Don’t juke the feeling No Box needed to control the music
No Box needed to control yo music
Feel that
The walls falling down around you
No BoxEmbed
