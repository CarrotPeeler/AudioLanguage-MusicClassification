This girl
These sounds
These days are alright
These days
These nights

These things almost make me smile
These things
Almost make me smile
These walks in this town
These things

These things
Almost make me smile

New York
And Beck too

And this girl
Who's my friend
These things almost make me smile
These things almost make me smile
These things
Almost make me smileEmbed
