Rest markings of the Gods
In crypts of deception and memory
Foretell past, present and future to all
An era of oscillation
We've looked to the skies
We've carved into stone
We've held up on high
The tracts and characters of the old

Antiquities to machines
Steel structures stand mighty and tall
The origins now obsolete
Which primitives had once foreseen
An era of oscillation
We've looked to the skies
We've carved into stone
We've held up on high
The tracts and characters of the old
You might also like
The heavens look down
On heathens abound
Over star covered skies
Mysteries surround
Designed from above
Creates gods below
Advancing a species forward
Ancient worlds bestowed

Present to future
From man to machines
Origin's history
The ancients once had foreseen
An era of oscillation
We've looked to the skies
We've carved into stone
We've held up on high
The tracts and characters of the oldEmbed
