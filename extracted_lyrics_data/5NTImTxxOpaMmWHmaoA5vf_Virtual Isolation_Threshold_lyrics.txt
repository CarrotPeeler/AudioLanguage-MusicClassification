2 ContributorsVirtual Isolation LyricsWe long for a place of constant perfection
Where action and outcome have exclusive protection
Like in a dream of the waking mind
Life with a freedom that is so hard to find
I cannot dream no more, my mind is a blank
Virtuality, electrons running round my brain
Virtuality, cybersex without the pain
Virtuality, life can never be the same
Virtuality, rock and roll without the fame
I am wired into the electronic drain
My mind is part of a gigantic mainframe
Melding my consciousness with input so profound
Relying on program for every sight and sound
I cannot dream no more, my mind is a blank
Virtuality, electrons running round my brain
Virtuality, cybersex without the pain
Virtuality, life can never be the same
Virtuality, rock and roll
Cd rom drive me far away
Hard discoveries in hyperspace
Don't delete me i am no sprite
Girlfriend's fat agnes chip burning bright
I have immersed myself in the isolation tank

Virtuality, cybersex without the pain
Virtuality, life can never be the same
Virtuality, rock and rollEmbed
