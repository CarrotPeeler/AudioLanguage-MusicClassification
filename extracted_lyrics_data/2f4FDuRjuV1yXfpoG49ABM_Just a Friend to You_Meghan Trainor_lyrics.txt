24 ContributorsJust a Friend to You Lyrics
Oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh

Why you gotta hug me like that
Every time you see me?
Why you always making me laugh?
Swear you're catching feelings

I loved you from the start
So it breaks my heart

When you say I'm just a friend to you
'Cause friends don't do the things we do
Everybody knows you love me too
Tryna be careful with the words I use
I'll say it 'cause I'm dying to
I'm so much more than just a friend to you

Mmm
When there's other people around
You never wanna kiss me
You tell me it's too late to hang out
Then you say you miss me

And I loved you from the start
So it breaks my heart

When you say I'm just a friend to you
'Cause friends don't do the things we do
Everybody knows you love me too
Tryna be careful with the words I use
I say it 'cause I'm dying to
I'm so much more than just a friend to you

You, ooh
You, ooh
You, ooh
You, ooh

You say I'm just a friend to you
Friends don't do the things we do
Everybody knows you love me too
I try to be careful with the words I use
I'll say it 'cause I'm dying to
I'm so much more than just a friend to you
A friend to you
A friend to you
A friend to you3Embed
