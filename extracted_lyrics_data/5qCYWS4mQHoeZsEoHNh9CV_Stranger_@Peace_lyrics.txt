15 ContributorsJoin My Militia (Nas Gave Me A Perm) LyricsMykki digital
Sound wave oasis
Niggas got the 'itis
Hit 'em with a bass lick
Make it so good a nigga wanna try and taste it
Straightjacket the beat
Don't forget where your place is
Just fight, hair draws Blanco voodoo
It's black magic music nigga, Blanco hoodo
They kept me in this holding cell for close to eight days
They can keep me here forever cause my story won't change
His name: Ahsan Abdul
Weight one-seventy, height 6'2
Size twelve shoe, black hair, brown eyes
The warmest smile in the world
But so cold-blooded inside
Who am I to judge him?
I hate him, but love him
Insha'Allah, he whispered
Ma'a salama I 
Damn, I didn't know my man was in the Taliban
The ta-ta-Taliban
I didn't know my man was in the, the Taliban
The ta-ta-Taliban
You might also likeBeats like a sensei
Elevate your mentals
Ass shakes fast
Two cheeks, two dimples
Rhymes like ripples
Raps like waves
Blanco stay floatin', stay focused, stay open
I been mental
Girl interrupted
Nurse please check my aorta
Cause I think my shit just busted
Many trusted me with the gift of the prophets
But my hands they are bloody so the prophecy was lost and
At all costs I wear my honor like a badge
Pride be my shield, ego be my flag
This shit make me mad when they doubt my potential
Talking so much shit like their opinions consequential
I used to want to be a better person
But bitch, who's better?
And nigga who's worse
Than the many-colored persons of humanity?
Big city lights, eh
Niggas losing sanity, woah
Many fear for that pop recognition
But babe are you heavyweight
Than the competition?
Play your position
I got that ammunition
Nigga join my militia
Nigga join my militia
Acting like I don't know who the fucks I am
Nah, they acting like I don't know who the fucks I am
Blanco brings the truth
And you bitches know what I said
Blanco is the truth
And you niggas know what I said
Blanco is the truth
Blanco is the truth
I said Blanco is the truth
Blanco is the truth
Blanco is the truth
And you niggas hate it, I said
Blanco is the truth
And you bitches hate it, I said
Blanco is the truth
Blanco is the truth
I said Blanco is the truth
Blanco is the truth
Nas gave me a perm
He said "You got the hidden gift, kid
Lead them, they'll learn."
Nas gave me a perm

You should be glad I pushed my mixtape back
Get yourself a little time before Mykki brings out the axe
You should be glad I pushed my mixtape back
Ya should be glad I pushed my mixtape back
Back

Back, back, back

Don't be afraid, nigga
Don't be a stranger
