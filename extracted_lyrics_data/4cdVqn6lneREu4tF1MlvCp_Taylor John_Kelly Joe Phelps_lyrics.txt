2 ContributorsTaylor John LyricsTaylor had a wife, she was married to the mirror
Make her glass-eyed lover buy a drink and then another round
'Round the kitchen table lined with cigarettes from years ago
Last night one fell onto the floor, yeah, to the floor, yeah, to the floor
Taylor used to marvel at the way the music sounded
She drifted down the carpet-bag to put another lamp shade on
There she was so young and pretty holding out her hand
To the last five years that livin' took away, away, hey, yeah, hey, yeah
It's a scavenger hunt in the best of times
A one-armed man with a box of dimes
Throw the stick and let the bulldog roll
Yeah, throw the stick and let the bulldog roll
Taylor's 37 yesterday and she'll be 21
An asphalt rhododendron where she fell across the car
Pocketbook explodin' with the money of delusion
Winks her smokin' yellowed eyes and rolls snakes along the floor
Hey, hey, hmm, yeah, along the floor
It's a scavenger hunt in the best of times
A one-armed man with a box of dimes
Throw the stick and let the bulldog roll
Throw the stick and let the bulldog roll, yeah

"No regret", says I, says she, "Waltzin' to the ice machine"
Where another hotel key has left a scar upon the soul
Her feet are nimble still when she wants she can go
Hey, yeah, she can go, hey, hey, yes, she can go
It's a scavenger hunt in the best of times
A one-armed man with a box of dimes
Throw the stick and let the bulldog roll
Throw the stick and let the bulldog roll, oh, yeah, oh, yeah
Come all you little sailors with a penchant for the sea
Look way down below for Taylor John he wants to be like me
Drownin' in the water, got his collar turned up cool
Tries to breathe now like a wretched stain and floats like a fool
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Scavenger hunt in the best of times
A one-armed man with a box of dimes
Throw the stick and let the bulldog roll
Throw the stick and let the bulldog roll, yeah
Throw the stick and let the bulldog roll
Getting throw the stick and let the bulldog roll
Throw the stick and let the bulldog roll, yeah
Throw the stick and let the bulldog roll
Throw the stick and let the bulldog
Throw the stick and let the bulldog roll, yeah
I'll throw the stick and let the bulldog roll
Throw the stick and let the bulldog rollEmbed
