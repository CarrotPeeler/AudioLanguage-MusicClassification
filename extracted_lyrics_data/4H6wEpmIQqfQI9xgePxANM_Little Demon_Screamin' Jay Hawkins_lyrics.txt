4 ContributorsLittle Demon Lyrics
Down in the valley on the foggy hill rock
Stood a crazy little demon blowing his top
Fire in his eyes and smoke from his head
You gotta be real cool to hear the words he said

He said "mumgmbgugnbmglbubub"
"Mugmgmgugmgubumububmubmub"
"Mmmhmhmigngmgignungungjubugm"
That cat was mad

He had steam in his soul for the one he loved so
He had death on his mind 'cause Miss Demon let him go
Gonna run through the world 'til he understand his pain
Somebody help him get Miss Demon home again

He said "mumgmbgugnbmglbubub"
"Mugmgmgugmgubumububmubmub"
"Mmmhmhmigngmgignungungnubumfng"
That cat, that cat was mad, yeah

He made the sky turn green, he made the grass turn red
He even put pretty hair on Grandma's bald head
He made the moon back up, he even pushed back time
He took the Frutti out of Tutti, he had the devil drinkin' wine
You might also like
He said "mumgmbgugnbmglbubub"
"Mugmgmgugmgubumububmubmub"
"Mmmhmhmigngmgignungungnubungub"
That cat was mad

Miss Demon felt good 'cause she finally got across
To the crazy little demon that the woman still the boss
Down in the valley on the foggy hill rock
You can still hear the demon blowing his top

He said "mumgmbgugnbmglbubub"
"Mugmgmgugmgubumububmubmub"
"Mmmhmhmigngmgignungungnubugmigng"
That cat was mad

He pushed back, brought in afternoon
He even made Leap Year jump over the moon
He took the 4th of July and he put it in May
He took this morning for a drive yesterday

He said "mumgmbgugnbmglbubub"
"Mugmgmgugmgubumububmubmub"
"Mmmhmhmigngmgignungungnubugmggugng"
That cat was madEmbed
