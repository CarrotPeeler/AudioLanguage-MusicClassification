1 ContributorCome on People LyricsHey come on people, let me take your hands and we will walk
Together in the sun through woods and fields, nobody needs to talk
About the bloody shit which now began to take this place
With politics 'bout neutron-bombs and war-industrial race
And all the needless systems, needless systems breeded out
Which never stop to pass the buck, to pour it on the crowd
Sun and raindrops can't create a rainbow
It needs the colours of your life
And with the power of your smile
And with the teardrops in your eyes
And with the love your mother raised deep in your heart
You can't go wrong
To tell the world what's going on
To throw your colours out for everyone
Come on people, feel the music, get up, move your bones
Let off yourself like JANIS did, or JAGGER from the STONES
Come on people, sing your songs against the walls of hate
We're not the first to do so, but we are not too late
To take a chance to stop all silly fuss
Become aware, this world was made for us
Somebody gave us this whole world and taught us to walk tall
To seize the wonders, seize the beautiness, to be a part of it all
Your eyes can see the flowers, your face can feel the sun
Nobody should be timid to sing and dance with everyone

(Ah, c'mon people)
Have you ever heard us telling lies to you in one of our songs?
We never thought 'bout misguiding you, or do you wrong
But sometimes it is hard for everyone to carry on
Repressing system's servants always rule the people strong
But if we take each other's hand to fight against the strife
We'll show the system's servants that they waste their time of life
Let's take the chance to stop all silly fuss
Become aware, this world was made for us
Sun and raindrops can't create a rainbow
It needs the colours of your life
And with the power of your smile
And with the teardrops in your eyes
And with the love your mother raised deep in your heart
You can't go wrongEmbed
