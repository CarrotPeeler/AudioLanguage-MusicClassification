5 ContributorsAt the Speed of a Yellow Bullet LyricsI drove a tank in on the left
I hid a rifle on the right
When she said "I see a tunnel
And at the end I see a light"
I see fire on the water
On the right bank and the left
And she smiles when she wears the iron curtain as a dress
I said come on, come on
You're tellin' me to see the truth even with my eyes sewn up
Come on
You're tellin' me to tell the truth even with my mouth sewn shut
I see a preacher with a secret
And he dare not make a sound
I see the smoke and fire
And the market burning down
I see a tulip on the grave
Of a lover who confessed
I'm a soldier and a poet
But I'm a dancer at best
I said come on, come on
You're tellin' me to see the truth even with my eyes sewn up
Come on
You're tellin' me to tell the truth even with my mouth sewn shut
I said come on
You're tellin' me to see the truth even with my eyes sewn up
Come on
You're tellin' me to tell the truth even with my mouth sewn shut

I'm burnin' houses baby
I'm burnin' bridges baby
Yes baby yes
I'm burnin' houses baby
I'm burnin' bridges baby
I drove a tank in on the left
I hid a rifle on the right
When she said "I see a tunnel
And at the end I see a light"
I see fire on the water
On the right bank and the left
And she smiles when she wears the iron curtain as a dress
I said come on, come on
You're tellin' me to see the truth even with my eyes sewn up
Come on
You're tellin' me to tell the truth even with my mouth sewn shut
I said come on
You're tellin' me to see the truth even with my eyes sewn up
Come on
You're tellin' me to tell the truth even with my mouth sewn shutEmbed
