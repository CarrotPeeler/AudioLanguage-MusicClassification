26 ContributorsFallen Soldiers Lyrics
What, I'ma live for my niggas
I'ma shine for my niggas

How can I express the sorrow, I learn to dread tomorrow
Had to see my nigga Yammy dead—he can rest with honor
'Cause he was reppin on his quest for dollars
I was the one who took him Uptown, with someone into measure powder
I treasure our memories together, hard to believe
I'ma never see you again, but I'ma make you breathe with a pen
So everyone can see you, my friend, in fly sneakers again
Life is sweet and kinda deep when it ends
Still remember you beefin' over bullshit calls at basketball games cheatin
Yo, my cipher ain't complete, I'm sorry for that argument we had
On twelfth street over a sale, knowing well that you was seekin dough as well
We made up the same night, through the years remained tight
The same love, same drugs, rockin' the same Nikes
Now that you gone, I'm here reppin' your name right

Did you ever lose a nigga you love?
Then ask yourself is there a heaven for thugs?
And will you be forgiven when your spirit is judged
This song is dedicated to my niggas above
Did you ever lose a nigga you love?
Then ask yourself is there a heaven for thugs?
And will you be forgiven when your spirit is judged
This song is dedicated to my niggas above
You might also like
To my cousin Bam
You my fuckin man, I find it hard to understand
You gone—your physical form is dormant
I'm lost like the Bulls without Jordan
Tell my man J.B. from Edgemere I said peace
Son, I live a thug life, I clutch mics
With the same intensity that I used to crush white
G-Fresh was at your funeral (Word), son I felt it
And if I start cryin when I rhyme I can't help it
Analyze, never think I forgot you, you my heart
And even death can't keep the two of us apart
From day one, watchin' cartoons, shootin' playguns
Who ever thought we see this day come?
Tell my moms I miss her—give her a kiss
And tell her that her youngest child done her proud
I know she heard about me runnin' wild
Y'all gone now, but livin in my memory
Fallen soldiers, sleepin' in serenity

Did you ever lose a nigga you love?
Then ask yourself is there a heaven for thugs?
And will you be forgiven when your spirit is judged
This song is dedicated to my niggas above
Did you ever lose a nigga you love?
Then ask yourself is there a heaven for thugs?
And will you be forgiven when your spirit is judged
This song is dedicated to my niggas above
Killa Black, what up my nigga?
I know you chillin' with my nigga Ill Will
Inside a ghetto heaven building
With a Mac-11, still in your jeans, screamin' Infamous Queens
Forty-First Side kid, you know me
I know the O-Z's are whiter there, pussy much tighter there
'Pac and Eazy-E coming through on low riders there
The same old thing, except there ain't no pain
Your brother Havoc doing his thing, yo for real
It's all good in the hood, the Escalade with the wood-grain
Son was never misunderstood, dearly departed
Hear me acknowledge all my people who passed
Whether holdin' heat, or in it for cash
Some of y'all led sinister paths, some are pure like
Dominican raw, knockin on heaven's door
The only thing you ever ran from in life is law
I reminisce your memories, for you this Hennessy we pour

Did you ever lose a nigga you love?
Then ask yourself is there a heaven for thugs?
And will you be forgiven when your spirit is judged
This song is dedicated to my niggas above
Did you ever lose a nigga you love?
Then ask yourself is there a heaven for thugs?
And will you be forgiven when your spirit is judged
This song is dedicated to my niggas, my niggas
