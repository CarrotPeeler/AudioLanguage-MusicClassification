4 ContributorsDamage Control LyricsDon’t remember how it starts
No start, no end
Let’s unloosen from the vault
Don’t remember how it starts
No start, no end
Let’s unloosen from the vault
Wipeout, no meds
I can sleep until it’s dark
Dream on, black lens
Silver linings in this world
Deep down, no end

Damage Control
I hardly wear a subtle tone
Or keep gloves, no shame
I was brilliant until I spoke
Dead air, a dumb joke
Let’s unloosen from the vault
No fault, no meds
Don’t remember how it starts
No start, no end

Last I did the worst things
I said a million things I shouldn’t have said
Last I did the worst things
I said a million things I shouldn’t have said
