Bring it back old childhood memories
Middle school, lower grade, elementary
Represent my whole town like sesame
Smiling and laughings how it's meant to be. X2

Wide awake for the next 24
And I'm drinking up my age plus I could use a 100 more
Now we skyping all these ladies in result of being bored
Now we crushed a few cases and I can't drink more
See before I use to listen now I they gotta wait
Cuz I'm getting real hungry with a lot of food on my plate
I never go to sleep on time, and if your wondering why
I'm still defining who I am looking up yeah I'm gunna climb
Then maybe at the top there's proof of who I gotta be
Writing reasons on this tables givens like geometry
We on the beat switch it up changing up the episode
The say if you never try, the chances are you'll never know
Hold your past to the sky, take a breath and let it go
Standing last in line never resting cuz I'm getting old
But I love my memories so I'm guessing that my visions old
So I hope y'all remember addy squad we original
You might also like
Bring it back old childhood memories
Middle school, lower grade, elementary
Represent my whole town like sesame
Smiling and laughings how it's meant to be. X2

Well tomorrow ima have to take the day off
And I'm skipping work So ill prolly get laid off
Ill admit I'm buzzin but I think that I could play it off
Take it off girl when you rolling with the Addy Squad
Steezy told em once that we broke so they hand me guap
Girl you wanna chill book a flight and come to antioch
Cardinal crazy yeah I am a Sequoit
Girls love the D like I'm living in Detroit
Twitters blowing up it'll basically destroy
Sitting comfortably numb like rolling with pink Floyd
Another brick in the wall is anybody out there?
Feeling on top yo is anybody down stairs
Down stairs attic yea I think y'all are down there
Around here gotta lotta people throwing up we
Crazy ass kids and growing up see
You ever here loud music then you should know its us peace

All we got are these memories
High, middle, lower school
Elementary
I hope that you remember me
Everything I did just really wasn't meant for me

Bring it back old childhood memories
Middle school, lower grade, elementary
Represent my whole town like sesame
Smiling and laughings how it's meant to be. X2Embed
