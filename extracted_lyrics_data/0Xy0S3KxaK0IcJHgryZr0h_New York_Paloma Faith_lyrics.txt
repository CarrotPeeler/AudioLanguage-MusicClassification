11 ContributorsNew York Lyrics
The days were long and the nights so cold
The pages turned and the tale unfolds
He'd left me for another lady
She stood so tall and she never slept
There was not one moment he could regret
He'd left me for another lady

He took my hand one day
And told me he was leaving
Me disbelieving
And I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I had to let him go

Her name was New York, New York
And she took his heart away, oh my
Her name was New York, New York
She had poisoned his sweet mind

Mmm.. The wolves they howled for my lost soul
I fell down a deep black hole, He'd left me for another lady
She poured the drinks and she poured the power
A diamond girl who could talk for hours
He'd left me for another lady
You might also like
Now I am on my own
He told me he was leaving
And I was pleading
And I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I had to let him go

Her name was New York, New York, and she took his heart away oh my, Her name was New York, New York, she had poisoned his sweet mind

The greatest times
I don't wanna hear it
Your new laughter lines
I don't wanna hear it
The new found friends she introduced you to
I don't wanna know them
I just wanna be with you
Please don't make me go to New York...

New York
And she took your heart away, oh my
Her name was New York, New York
She poisoned your sweet mind
She poisoned your sweet mind4Embed
