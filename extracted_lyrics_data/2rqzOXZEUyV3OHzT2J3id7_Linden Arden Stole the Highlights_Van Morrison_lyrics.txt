Linden Arden stole the highlights
With one hand tied behind his back
Loved the moon and sun and whiskey
Ran like water in his veins

Loved to go to church on Sunday
Even though he was a drinkin' man
When the boys came to San Francisco
They were lookin' for his life

But he found out where they were drinkin'
Met them face to face outside
Cleaved their heads off with a hatchet
Lord, he was a drinkin' man
And when somebody tried to get above him
He just took the law into his own hands

Linden Arden stole the highlights
And they put his fingers through the glass
He had heard all those stories many, many times before
And he did not care no more to ask
You might also like
And he loved the little children
Like they were his very own
He said, "Someday it may get lonely"
Now he's livin', livin' with a gunEmbed
