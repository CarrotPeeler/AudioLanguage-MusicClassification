2 ContributorsPoison Street LyricsWe were singing in the rain, like we invented singing
There's a light in the sky from a million street lights
And we danced all the steps from all those old time movies
Rolling down the hill with laughing hearts
In Poison Street, they guard the gates with bitter, bitter tongues
In Poison Street, we'll laugh out loud until the shadows go melt away
And I love you now like I love you always, ever
Kissing in the dark like a couple of kids
You gave me life, you gave me light and thunder
Like a blind man sees for the very first time
In Poison Street, we'll go crashing through the walls that history made for us
In Poison Street, we'll spring the traps and race away
So just a kick for this dark damned city of ours
And a kiss, yeah a kiss for you
And just a drink, a toast to the days to come
Now Poison Street won't break us any more
We were singing in the rain, like we wrote that song
There's a light in the sky from the streetlights all around
You gave me life, you gave me light and thunder
Like a man makes fire for the very first time
