22 grand job, in the city it's alright
22 grand job, in the city it's alright
22 grand job, in the city that sounds nice, it's alright, it's alright
In the city it's alright

22 grand job, in the city it's alright
22 grand job, in the city it's alright
22 grand job, in the city that sounds nice, it's alright, it's alright
In the city it's alright

Girl from work, looks alright
But the lights are too bright
Bloke in sales likes her too
What am I supposed to do?
But he's earning 28
And I'm on 22
It's alright, it's alright
In the city it's alright

22 grand job, in the city it's alright
22 grand job, in the city it's alright
22 grand job, in the city that sounds nice, it's alright, it's alright
In the city it's alright

Down to Old Street Thursday night
In the city that sounds nice
Talking shop with my colleagues
Did we do the same degree?
You've said less to me all week
Got to go home, in early
That's alright, that's alright
If the money is alright

22 grand job, in the city it's alright
22 grand job, in the city it's alright
22 grand job, in the city that sounds nice, it's alright, it's alright
In the city it's alright

22 grand job
22 grand job
22 grand job
22 grand job
In the city that sounds nice1Embed
