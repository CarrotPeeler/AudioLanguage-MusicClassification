2 ContributorsNew Year LyricsOnce I crossed a man I knew before
He watched as I waved and I'm sure that he saw me
Written in the dust said "what's it all for?"
I'm sure I don't know but I know it's worth knowing
And how will I know if I was wrong?
Used to know the way he moved around
And the smell of his shirts
And the feel of his body
Hard to comprehend, it happened that way
Maybe I'm wrong, but I think we had something
And how will I know if I was wrong?
How will I know if I was wrong?You might also likeEmbed
