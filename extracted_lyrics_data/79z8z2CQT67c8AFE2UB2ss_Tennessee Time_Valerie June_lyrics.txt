Runnin' on Tennessee time
Runnin' on Tennessee time
There's a tap on my window
There's a ring at my door
And I'll answer in Tennessee time

Houston's a hard town, New York's not for mine
Every town I drift through, I just can't unwind
New Orleans' hustle keeps a woman down
Waters so high, I can't touch the ground

Runnin' on Tennessee time
Runnin' on Tennessee time
There's a tap on my window
There's a ring at my door
And I'll answer in Tennessee time

Thought there'd be something in those bright lights
But all I got was lonely sleepless nights
Now I know what I didn't know back then
When I get to Tennessee, I'll never leave again
You might also like
Runnin' on Tennessee time
Runnin' on Tennessee time
There's a tap on my window
There's a ring at my door
And I'll answer in Tennessee time

Runnin' on Tennessee time
Runnin' on Tennessee time
There's a tap on my window
There's a ring at my door
And I'll answer in Tennessee timeEmbed
