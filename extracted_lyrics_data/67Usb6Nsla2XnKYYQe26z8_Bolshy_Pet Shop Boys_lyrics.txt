Raise your voice
(Поднимите свой голос)
Start a feud
(Начало вражды)
Spoilt for choice
(Испорченный для выбора)
I hesitate
(Я не решаюсь)
To intrude
(вмешиваться)

Give me a sign, give me a smile
I'll wait if you say it will be worth my while
There you are, pretending you're lonely
I don't believe you don't know you could own me
Oh
