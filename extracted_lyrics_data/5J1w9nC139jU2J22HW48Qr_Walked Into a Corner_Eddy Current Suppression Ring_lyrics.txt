I didn't feel like talking
But I'd walked into a party
A party full of people
So I walked into the corner
I walked into the corner of the room
I walked into the corner of the room
I was feeling anti social
I didn't feel like talking
But I'd walked into a party
A party full of people
So I walked into the corner
I walked into the corner of the room
I walked into the wall
I walked into the wall
I walked into the wall
I walked into the wall
I walked into the wall
To save me from the fall
I walked into the wall
To save me from the fall
I walked into the wallYou might also likeEmbed
