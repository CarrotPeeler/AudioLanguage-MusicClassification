2 ContributorsMore For Me Lyrics
Had a bad day, as bad as they come
Time to get a real job, you've got to stop having fun
So I, so I got a real job, I'm working nine to nine
I'm making five bucks an hour until the day I die
Got a straw inside of me and it's filled just fine
Got a straw inside of me with the strongest wine
I'm a one-third passion, I'm a two-thirds pride
Said I used to have a life once
He said, I used to like your smile once
Singing silence to the world
But the stars kept marching
He said, Silence to everyone, I said, I'm still talking

Have you got some more deep inside of you
Deep inside of you, deep inside of you
I'll always have more for me, yeah, yeah
I'll always have more for me, yeah, yeah

I take a little more for me
A more for me, a more for me, baby

I got a picture of the way the world has summed me up
If I could have one wish, I sure wish that I had never grown up
I got a picture of the way I looked when I was three
I came out laughing, screaming, dancing
I came out laughing, screaming, dancing
I used to be free spirited
Now I'm just free of sleep
I got a burning passion in my throat
I got a burning passion inside me
I got a job that wastes my time and gift
I got a life that needs a serious lift
And all the things I wanted
Yes, all the things I want
Go, all the things I wanted
All the things I wanted
All the things I want
All the things I want
You might also like
Have you got some more deep inside of you
Deep inside of you, deep inside of you
I'll always have more for me, yeah, yeah
I'll always have more for me, yeah, yeah

I take a little more for me
A more for me, a more for me, baby

He says all the things I want, they go
All the things I want, they go
All the things I want, they go
All the things I want, they go

I take a little more for me
A more for me, a more for me, baby
I take a little more for me
A more for me, a more for me, babyEmbed
