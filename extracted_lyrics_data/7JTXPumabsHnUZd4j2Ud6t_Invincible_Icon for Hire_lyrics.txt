7 ContributorsInvincible Lyrics
I am, I'm invincible
I am, I'm invincible
You ain't seen nothing yet

In the dark, in the mess
All my life, i have been
Folded up, holding back
Don't know how, we live like that
From the flame, i emerge
With the strength, i have earned

I belong to the night
But I learned to survive
I know i gotta fight the feeling inside

I am, I'm invincible
Uh uh, unkillable
I am, I'm invincible
You ain't seen nothing yet

You ain't seen nothing yet
You ain't seen nothing yet
You might also like
When the dark, comes for me
I won't run, I will scream
I'm stronger than i used to be oh

I belong to the night
But I learned to survive
I know i gotta fight the feeling inside

I am, I'm invincible
Uh uh, unkillable
I am, I'm invincible
You ain't seen nothing yet

You ain't seen nothing yet
You ain't seen nothing yet

I don't throw out nice words
To make me feel better about what I've endured
You better believe I'm not that naive
You cut me up yeah, you bet I'll bleed
So invincible, maybe not quite true
I keep saying it to it gets through
Till I start acting like I can do
Whatever the heck I put my mind too
You live like you're invisible
Dont you wanna be Invincible
I am, I'm invincible
Uh uh, unkillable
I am, I'm invincible
You ain't seen nothing yet
You ain't seen nothing yetEmbed
