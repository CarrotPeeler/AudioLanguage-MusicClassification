1 ContributorMy Red Shoes Story / 僕のレッド・シューズ物語 LyricsOn my way home from school
I found her in a shoe case
Summer evening, the wind was cool
Caught me her very grace
On my way home from school
I found her in a shoe case
Summer evening, the wind was cool
Caught me her very grace
I made up my mind, swore by my teacup
Not to eat until my mother gives up
For my red shoes (my red shoes)
My red shoes (my red shoes)
My red shoes (my red shoes)
My rеd shoes (my red shoes)
So I worе my red shoes and
Walked around everywhere
Christmas time I held the firebrand
Blue hat in Mayfair
Big kangaroo in the zoo stopped saying coo
Hate all blues I love snooze yes I won't lose
In my red shoes (my red shoes)
My red shoes (my red shoes)
My red shoes (my red shoes)
My red shoes (my red shoes)

Chewing gum and all
Rainy day, muddy seashore
Sorry I was bold
Other shoes looking so good
Oh, this fickle boy
One day she went away
From my shoe case
Years have passed now I'm at ease
On a limousine seat
Wearing a dark brown suit
And sunglasses so neat
But once in a while drinking a glass of Pernod
I remember when I ran down on the snow
In my red shoes (my red shoes)
My red shoes (my red shoes)
My red shoes (my red shoes)
My red shoes (my red shoes)Embed
