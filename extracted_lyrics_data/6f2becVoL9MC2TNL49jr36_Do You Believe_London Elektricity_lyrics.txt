2 ContributorsPossible Worlds Lyrics
London Elektricity
Let's spark up something nice right now, yeah
Yo now
Yo now

We all got baggage (Yeah)
We all got luggage (Yeah)
We all got life (Huh)
We all got rubbish (Yeah)
We all got feelings (Yeah)
Some discuss it
Some will shun it (Huh)
Others will plummet (What?)
But I don't mind if you're open and honest (I don't)
'Cause every gem can shine
If you've got the polish
Or if you give it time
And show that you've acknowledged
I'm just another burnt soul deep in the quarries, huh
I see souls like unearthed gems
I'd love to see shine but that's on them
'Cause half the time they don't even realise that they are them (Yeah)
A beautiful being that's being drowned by them (Yeah)
So if our worlds collide
Anything's possible
Sky's no limit, astronomical (Nah)
We can all reach first, breathe, abdominal
Stretch out the lungs (Ah) and open your opticals and watch it all (Haha)
'Cause I believe in fate (Yeah)
I believe in us (I do)
I believe if you believe we could make it up (That's right)
We all on a path (Yeah)
Where journeys are tough
When the mist rolls
And diversions come (Huh)
Sometimes we go off course
Right back to square one
Or get a little misguided
Forget to walk, we run (True)
Right into somethin'
That can confuse the tongue (Yeah)
And leave it twisted
Conflicted but then

Everything I needed
Everything I wanted
Sometimes the things you want ain't what you need in life
Everything I needed
Everything I wanted
Sometimes the things you want ain't what you need in life
Everything I needed
Everything I wanted
Sometimes the things you want ain't what you need in life
Everything I needed
Everything I wanted
Sometimes the things you want ain't what you need in life

Needed, wanted
Needed, wanted
Needed, wanted
Needed
Needed, wanted
Needed, wanted
Needed, wanted
Needed
Needed, wanted
Needed, wanted
Needed, wanted

Needed, wanted
Needed, wanted
Needed, wanted
Ooh-ah

Everything I needed
Everything I wanted
Sometimes the things you want ain't what you need in life
Everything I needed
Everything I wanted
Sometimes the things you want ain't what you need in life
Everything I needed
Everything I wanted
Sometimes the things you want ain't what you need in life
Everything I needed
Everything I wanted
Sometimes the things you want ain't what you need in life

Yo, yo now
The things you wantin' ain't what you needin', so leave it
The things you needed, you never wanted, aren't pleasin'
You can plant a thousand wishes from the seedlings
Not everything will grow but some blossom into achievements
Possibly the unwatered start findin' meanings
The ones you watered can drown through misbelievin'
It's unorthodox how the gods plan their meetings
But when you find you, that's the guidance to light
That's the guidance to light
That's the guidance to light
That's the guidance to lightEmbed
