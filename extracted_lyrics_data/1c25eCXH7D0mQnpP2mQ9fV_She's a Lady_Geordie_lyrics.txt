3 ContributorsShe Got It Lyrics
Okay, you were about four months old
I used to play nursery rhymes, like, all the time
And, um, I remember your eyes were closed
And then all of the sudden you could hear
*humming*
It was so special because there you are, four months old
And you're creating a melody

She's got that cornbread thick on the side
Jiffy don't know what happened
God turned her into some sweet potato pie
Got so thick, it made her happy
Got so thick it made the peanut butter cry
She probably got it from her mammy (From her mammy)
Ain't no telling where she got it from, yeah
Whole family body bangin' (Body bangin')
Booty big, she's the eclipse to the sun, yeah

Cause she got it, she got it, got it
Her table manners never match her heels
Kissing pavement with a switch in her hips
And her curved outline matches her french-tips, yeah
Cause she got it, she got it, got it
Mama raised her right, yes she did
But she ain't gon’ hesitate to work that thang, yes, she will
If you tryna be her man you better close the deal, yeah

She’s a queen baby, baby
Royalty from her head down to her toes, yeah
East Atlanta crazy native (EA)
And got a ring around every man she knows, yeah
Daddy taught her how to grind
'Bout that money cause it stays on her mind
If you know about that baby, yeah, you know she a dime
She’s a Georgia peach lady, turning heads every time yeah

It’s the way that she walks, yeah, her body so vicious
Working out everyday, cause she stay up in the kitchen
Ain’t got time, ain’t got time
Cause she got them bills to pay
And when she gets a break, she's making sure her hair is laid
It’s the way that she walks, yeah her body so vicious
Working out everyday, cause she stay up in the kitchen
Ain’t got time, ain’t got time
Cause she got them bills to pay
And when she gets a break, she’s making sure her hair is laid

Ohh, ohh
She got it, she got it, got it
She got it, she got it, got it
Ohh, yeah
One more good time, one more good time for the children of JerichoEmbed
