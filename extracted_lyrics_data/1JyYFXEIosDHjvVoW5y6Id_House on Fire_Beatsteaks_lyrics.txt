4 ContributorsHouse on Fire LyricsI got no reason to fight
And I don't care what's wrong and who's right
There's nothing that we didn't try
Pretending to know what we don't understand yet
I got my back to the wall
And no one's gonna answer my call
Like a hit from out of the blue
I woke up this morning, it came without warning
My house is on fire
My house is on fire
My house is on fire
I've been hanging from a tree
I've been down to the sea
As I walked every street
I found no one to cheat
As I stay up all night
As I lay by your side
I've been chasing around
I got up, I came down, so come on
I make my way all around
And if everybody's wearing you down
It's been that way for too long
I woke up this morning, it came without warning
We got no reason to fight
So will anybody join us tonight
Will you stop and give it a try
My house is on fire but I'm alive

As I stay up all night
As I lay by your side
I've been chasing around
I got up, I came down, so come on
My house is on fire
My house is on fire
House is on fire
