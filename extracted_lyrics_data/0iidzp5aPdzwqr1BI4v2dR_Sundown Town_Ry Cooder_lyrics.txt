2 ContributorsSundown Town Lyrics
Mine eyes have seen the beauty of a land bright and fair
My soul looked out and wondered, can we make the journey there
But I've lost my sight, um huh, and I have to be led
Well I mean to work for justice till I'm dead

Sundown town, sundown town
Don't let 'em catch you, Buddy, when the sun goes down
There won't be no more friends around
Don't let 'em catch you, Buddy, when the sun goes down
Look here

Well I used to prеach and I used to pray
Was the prayinest man that you еver did see
But they ran my people off one day
Now there ain't nobody round that look like me

Sundown town, sundown town
Don't let 'em catch you, Buddy, when the sun goes down
There won't be no more friends around
Don't let 'em catch you, Buddy, when the sun goes down

Well we used to sing and we used to shout
Was the shoutinest church that you ever did see
But I ain't going to preach no more and I ain't goin' to sing
And I don't feel at home in this town no more
You might also like
Sundown town, sundown town
Don't let 'em catch you, Buddy, when the sun goin' down
Ain't no needs you hangin' around
Don't let 'em catch you, Buddy, when the sun goin' down

If you black, you better get back
And if you brown, don't you hang around
And if you red, you might be dead
And if you ain't white, man, you just ain't right
No no

Sundown town, sundown town
Don't let 'em catch you, Buddy, when the sun goin' down
There won't be no friends around
Don't let 'em catch you, Buddy, when the sun goin' down

Don't let 'em catch you
Don't let 'em catch you, Buddy, when the sun goin' down
Don't let 'em catch you
Oh, don't let 'em catch you when the sun goin' down
Sundown town, sundown town
Don't let 'em catch you, Buddy, when the sun goin' down
There won't be no friends around
Don't let 'em catch you, Buddy, when the sun goin' downEmbed
