16 ContributorsHow Come You Donâ€™t Call Me Lyrics
(But all I wanna know, baby, is)
(If what we have is good) Oh, whoa, oh, oh
(Just pick up the motherfuckin' phone, damn)
Yeah, baby

I keep your picture beside my bed
And I still remember everything you said
I always thought our love was so right, I guess I was wrong
Always thought you'd be by my side, papa, now you're gone
(And I'm not tryna hear that shit)

What I wanna know, baby
If what we had was good
How come you don't call me anymore?

Still light the fire on a rainy night
I still like it better when you're holding me tight (You know, yeah)
Everybody said
Everybody said that we should never part (Mmm, oh no)
Tell me baby, baby, baby, why
Why you wanna go and break my heart? Hey, ooh
You might also like
All I wanna know is, baby
If what we had was good
How come you don't call me anymore? Oh, hey (Hey)

(You know what?)
Sometimes it feels like I'm gonna die
If you don't call me, papa
Ooh, you got to try
I'll get down on my knees
Hoping you please, please
Oh-oh, ooh, won't you call me sometime, papa?
(You know it's just one lousy quarter)
(Why don't you call me anymore?)

Why on Earth
Can't you just pick up the phone?
You know I don't like to be alone
How come you don't call me? (Why must you torture me?)
How come you don't call me? (Hey, hey)
How come you don't call me? (Oh, call me sometime, baby)3Embed
