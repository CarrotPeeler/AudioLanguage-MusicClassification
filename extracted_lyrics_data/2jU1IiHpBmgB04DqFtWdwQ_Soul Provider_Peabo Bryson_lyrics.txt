3 ContributorsSoul Provider Lyrics
Oh sugar
Lord have mercy

Talk about love, talk about trust
Talkin' 'bout forever baby
When I'm talkin' 'bout us
I give you my word, stick to my guts
Believe when I tell ya baby
That we've just begun

You don't understand, no
The full intent of my plan

Don't you know that I wanna be
Your soul provider
I wanna stay that way
For the longest time
I wanna be, your soul provider
Just say you'll let me
And darlin', you know I will

I know you've been hurt
I know you're love shy
You don't have to say it baby
It's gonna take some time
You got my heart, in the palm of your hand
Swear it's gonna stay there baby
Give me half a chance

You don't understand
The full intent of my plan

Don't you know that I wanna be
Your soul provider
I wanna stay that way
For the longest time
I wanna be, your soul provider
Say you'll let me
Don't you know that I will

I've been waitin' for a long time for somebody like you
To give my love, all my love day and night
Just say you'll be mine for the rest of your life
Baby I'll show you why

Don't you know that I wanna be
Your soul provider
I wanna stay that way
For the longest time
I wanna be, your soul providerEmbed
