Tip toe across the freeway
White flash of metal May Day
Show the hitch-hikers thumbnail
The beer can catches the lonesome whale
Gotta get off the ground now, honey
Just can't stand around, no...

Ohhhhhhh
Shake, shake, shake the dope out
Ohhhhhhh
Shake, shake, shake the dope out
Ohhhhhh
Shake, shake, shake the dope out
Ooh, ho, Hey hey hey!

Arms, they're turning nuts
Bodies about to burst
Colours they are melting
Melting in the sand
Gotta get off thе ground now, honey
Just can't stand around, no...

Ohhhhhhh
Shake, shake, shakе the dope out
Ohhhhhhh
Shake, shake, shake the dope out
Ohhhhhh
Shake, shake, shake the dope out
Ooh, ho, Hey hey hey!You might also likeEmbed
