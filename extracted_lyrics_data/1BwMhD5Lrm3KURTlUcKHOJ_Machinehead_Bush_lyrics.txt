Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Breathe in, breathe out
Breathe in, breathe out
Breathe in
Breathe in, breathe out
Breathe in, breathe out
Breathe in

Tied to a wheel, my fingers gotta feel
Bleeding through a tourniquet smile
I spin on a whim, I slide to the right
I felt you like electric light

For our love, for our fear
For our rise against the years and years and years

Got a machine head, it's better than the rest
Green to red, machine head
Got a machine head, it's better than the rest
Green to red
You might also like
And I walk from my machine
I walk from my machine, yeah

Breathe in, breathe out
Breathe in, breathe out
Breathe in

Deaf, dumb, thirty, starting to deserve this
Leaning on my conscience wall
Blood is like wine, unconscious all the time
If I had it all again, I'd change it all

Got a machine head, it's better than the rest
Green to red, machine head
Got a machine head, it's better than the rest
Green to red, yeah

I walk from my machine
I walk from my machine

I've seen the best minds of my generation
They are starving, hysterical, and naked
Breathe in, breathe out
Breathe in, breathe out
Breathe in, breathe in, breathe in

Got a machine head, it's better than the rest (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Green to red, machine head
Got a machine head, it's better than the rest (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Green to red, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Better than the rest (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Better than the rest (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Machine head, head, head, head, head, head

I walk from my machine
I walk from my machine3Embed
