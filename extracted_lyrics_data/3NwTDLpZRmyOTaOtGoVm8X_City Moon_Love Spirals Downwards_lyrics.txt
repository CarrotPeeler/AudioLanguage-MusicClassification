1 ContributorCity Moon LyricsOh oh oh
Bad moon
You were more to me
Velvet white
Starry child
Sailing to the sea
City moon so soon
One remaining day
Black night outside
Given more to say
And yellow time is overhead
Unchanging things imprinted
Can it all be clear
City moon so soon
Youâ€™re the world to me
Velvet white
Starry child
Sailing to the sea
And yellow time is overhead
Unchanging things imprinted
Can it all be clearYou might also likeEmbed
