C'est si bon
Lovers say that in france
When they thrill to romance
It means that it´s so good
C´est si bon
So I say to you
Like the french people do
Because it´s oh so good
Every word, every sigh, every kiss, dear
Leads to only one thought
And the thought is this, dear!
C´est si bon
Nothing else can replace
Just your slyest embrace
And if you only would
Be my own for the rest of my days
I will whisper this phrase
My darling, my darling...
C'est si bon!You might also likeEmbed
