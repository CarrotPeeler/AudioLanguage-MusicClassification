2 ContributorsCastles In The Sand LyricsFrom the albums I'LL PLAY FOR YOU (1975), GREATEST HITS (1975) and
THE SEALS & CROFTS COLLECTION (1979)
Every little thing you do makes me feel good
And I could be your prince, babe, if I only would
And I could take you places you think you'd like to go
And I could show you secrets behind ev'ry closed door
But it's only the castles in the sand. I'll never be your man
Castles in the sand, they'll never, never stand
Like castles in the sand, I'll never be your man
Now every little thing you do makes me feel fine
And I could be your daddy, if it's on your mind
And I could buy you diamonds and all them fancy clothes
And I could give you lovin' like nobody knows
But it's only the castles in the sand, love. I'll never be your man
Castles in the sand, they'll never, never stand
Like castles in the sand, I'll never be your man
Your eyes are dancing and saying to me in the sunlight, I want you so
You are beautiful, a princess. But I'm like the sand when the wind blows
It's only the castles in the sand. I'll never be your man
Castles in the sand, they'll never, never stand
Like castles in the sand, I'll never be your man
Castles in the sand, castles in the sand, castles in the sand
See the castles in the sandYou might also likeEmbed
