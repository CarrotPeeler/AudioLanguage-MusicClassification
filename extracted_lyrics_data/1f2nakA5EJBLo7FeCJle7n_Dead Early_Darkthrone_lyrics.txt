5 ContributorsDead Early Lyrics
I got the chance
On a silver plate
To do things right
To do things straight

The worlds are clear to me
I'm not going to last
Deep is the lake of thoughts
Onlookers stare like apes

Tangled in a web of lies
Energy constantly rotating
Reaching my end
I got the chance on a silver plate
To do things right, to do things straight

This starry night
I'm shooting silver plates
Applauding apes
Send me to the depth of spaceYou might also likeEmbed
