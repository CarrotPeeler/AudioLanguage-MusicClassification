4 ContributorsSgt. Hetfieldâ€™s Motorbreath Pub Band LyricsIt was 20 years ago today
Motorhead taught this band to play
At first they were so out of style
But they're guaranteed to raise your bile
So may I introduce to you
The act that drank 1000 beers
Sgt. Hetfield's Motorbreath pub band
Sgt. Hetfield's Motorbreath pub band
We hope you will enjoy the show
Sgt. Hetfield's Motorbreath pub band
Just thrash and let the metal flow
Sgt. Hetfield's Motor, Sgt. Hetfield's Motor
Sgt. Hetfield's Motorbreath pub band
It's wonderful to drink beer, It's certainly a swill
You're such a lovely audience
We'd like to fuck your Motorbreath
You'd love to fuck your...
I don't really want to stop the show
But I thought you might like to know
James Hetfield's gonna sing a song
And he wants you all to thrash along
So let me introduce to you
The band who drank 1000 beers
