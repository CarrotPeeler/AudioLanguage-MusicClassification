Get in line with the plans
Deconstruct, reassemble
Drill a hole in your head
Say hello to the future
Reproduce, reconnect
Realize nothing changes
You are part of a piece
Of a fucking machine!

Get in line, get in line, get in line!
Get in line, get in line, get in line!

Say your prayers, speak the truth
Lie and suffer in silence
Sell you soul to the screen
On the altar of progress
Scan the earth, print the sky
Draw a map of the circuits
See your part in the scheme
Of the fucking machine!

Get in line, get in line, get in line!
Get in line, get in line, get in line!
You might also like
Show your face, hide your scars
Be the pride of your nation
Take a gun, shoot a load
Join the army of puppets
Be in time, stay online
Stay in tune with the noises
Hear the voices that scream
In the fucking machine!

Get in line, get in line, get in line!
Get in line, get in line, get in line!

Get in line!
Get a life!


God among machines!

Get in line, get in line, get in line!
Get in line, get in line, get in line!
Get in line, get in line, get in line!
Get in line, get in line, get in line!1Embed
