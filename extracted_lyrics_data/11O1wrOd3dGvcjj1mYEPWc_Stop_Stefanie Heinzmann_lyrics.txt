1 ContributorStop Lyrics
When i get my nails done and hair right
And when i've got a new dress
Know about your favourite perfume
Gonna put it on and make you senseless
I know you see me as little girl
Cute and shy and playful
But now the time has come around
And i'm gonna show you what i'm made of
And i bet i drive you crazy
(chorus)
Baby, just stop
Baby, don't go
There's so much more i wanna show
Baby, just stop
Just take a look
There's no other methods in my book
Cause you haven't seen
The best of me
I'm a woman and not just the tears
I won't make you please
Just stop, right now
(end chorus)
You might also likeDon't need to mention your attention
Has moved in my direction
And from the look in your eye
I'm an object of affection
Don't get it wrong there's more in me
Than just a pretty thing to look at
I got a heart of gold and i know
That i want a man who wants to keep it
But for now i drive you crazy
(chorus)
Baby, just stop
Baby, don't go
There's so much more i wanna show
Baby, just stop
Just take a look
There's no other methods in my book
Cause you haven't seen
The best of me
I'm a woman and not just the tears
I won't make you please
Just stop, right now
After all is said and done
You've always been the one
And i bet you noticed me now, now


Baby, just stop
Just take a look
There's no other methods in my book
Cause you haven't seen
The best of me
I'm a woman and not just the tears
I won't make you please
Just stop, right nowEmbed
