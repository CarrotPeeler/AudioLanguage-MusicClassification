Destiny turned her face
Nightmares and violent shapes
The state of dreaming has left me numb
Blue eyes and wandering lips
True lies through fingertips
Hidden tales of forbidden love
You've left me miserable
Miserable, miserable, miserable
Love, you've left me miserable
Miserable, miserable, miserable

Maybe we're just sleepwalking
Maybe we're just sleepwalking

Visions of better times
Kingdoms and lilac wine
Why did God fail to improve us?
Teardrops of acid rain
Burning down through my veins
Can't I just sleep for a night?

Oh, despite my fears, I danced for you
Even while others knew
Oh, when can one wake and live again?
I'm desperate, desperate, yeah!

Maybe we're just sleepwalking
Maybe we're just sleepwalking

U-uh
Yeah!

Maybe we're just sleepwalking
Maybe we're just sleepwalking
Maybe we're just sleepwalking

Oh, despite my fears, I danced for you
Maybe we're just sleepwalking
Maybe we're just sleepwalking
Oh, when can one wake and live again?
Maybe we're just sleepwalking
Maybe we're just sleepwalking
Maybe we're just sleepwalking40Embed
