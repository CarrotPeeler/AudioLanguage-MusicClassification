4 ContributorsOcean View Lyrics
Blood done been runnin' down streets flood with beats
Of pepper spray over cracked concrete, so
So vicious make a rich man's neck split
Underworld 'bout to wreck shit, bet this
Banks closed, stomachs churnin'
Lines and rows, cops blastin' out church windows
They heard word of two on the terror list
Hid in the pews just two city terrace kids
One held a piece just for peace of mind
The other was spittin' poems, blowin' minds on a picket line
Barricades lay 'cross, made with bumpers and burnin' tires
And you could smell the exhaust
And you could hear the kids scream, don't play us too close
Have the mic or the heater, but you can't hold both
And they were both
And they were both

Ocean of tears rise
Rise a flame to tear them down
Ocean of past crimes now
Fill our hearts to tear them down
You might also like
The water main's cut off
Panic hit the manor of the mayor who's soft
Word on the streets that the cops got off
They shook to the rhythm of
Heaters that burned like claps of thunder
You turn to look at vengeance returned
That shattered control, after the whole
Shock of the news that a bomb hit the bridge at Broadway
Gridlock, full stop, every exit way
From Chavez to Main, downtown was the same
Every corner aflame with
Lines of people stripped of they clothes, freeze
Hold up your ID's, their houses burned as they watched
The colonel looked at his clock and they were all
And they were all
And they were all

Ocean of tears rise
Rise a flame to tear them down
Ocean of past crimes now
Fill our hearts to tear them down
Ocean of tears rise
Rise a flame to tear them down
Ocean of past crimes now
Fill our hearts to tear them down

We'll light the flame to tear them down
Light the flame to tear 'em down
We'll light the flame to tear them down
We'll light the flame to tear 'em down
We'll light the flame to tear them down
We'll light the flame to tear them down

To tear them down
To tear them down2Embed
