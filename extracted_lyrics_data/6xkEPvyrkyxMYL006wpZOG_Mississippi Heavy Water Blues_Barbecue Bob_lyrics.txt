1 ContributorMississippi Heavy Water Blues LyricsI was walking down the Levee with my head hanging low
Looking for my sweet mama but she ain't here no more
Thats why Im crying Mississippi heavy water blues
Lord, Lord, Lord, Im so blue, my house got washed away
And im crying "how long for another pay day"
Thats why im crying Mississippi heavy water blues
Im sitting here looking, at all of this mud
And my girl got washed away in that Mississippi flood
Thats why im crying Mississippi heavy water blues
I hope she come back, some day kind and true
Ain't no one satisfy her like her sweet papa do
Thats why im crying Mississippi heavy water blues
I think I heard a moan, on the Arkansas side
You might also likeCrying how long before sweet mama arrive
Thats why im crying Mississippi heavy water blues
Im in Mississippi, with mud all in my shoes
My girl in louisiana with those high water blues
Thats why im crying Mississippi heavy water blues
Spoken: Lord send me a sweet mama
Got plenty of muddy water, dont need no water cold
I need some sweet mama to send me daddy love
Thats why im crying Mississippi heavy water blues
Nothing but muddy water, as far as I could see
I need some sweet mama, come shake that thing with me
Thats why im crying Mississippi heavy water blues
Listen here you men, one more thing I'd like to say
Ain't no womens out here, for they all got washed away
Thats why im crying Mississippi heavy water blues
Lord, Lord, Lord
Mississippi shakin'
Louisiana sinkin'
The whole towns a shrinkin'
Robert Hicks is Singin'
Thats why im crying Mississippi heavy water blues
