10 ContributorsNothingâ€™s Real But Love Lyrics
Standing in a line, wonder why it don't move
Tryna get a hand, watching people break the rules
And maybe the man in charge doesn't like my face
But then this world's not always good

And nothing's real but love
Nothing's real but love
No money, no house, no car can beat the love

They watch us open-mouthed as we joke around like fools
See who can be the worst, watch what I can do
But then the door gets slammed, slammed right in my face
And I guess this world's not always good

And nothing's real but love
Nothing's real but love (Oh)
No house, no car, no job can beat the love
Oh, it won't fill you up
No money, no house, no car is like love

La, la, la, la, ah
La, la, la, la
Yeah
You might also like
I put it all away
Holding it back for a rainy day
But what if that day don't come?
I need love

No money, no house, no car is like love
Oh, it don't fill you up
It won't build you up, it won't fill you up, it's not love
And nothing's real without love
No money, no house, no car is like love
Nothing's real but love
No money, no house, no car is like loveEmbed
