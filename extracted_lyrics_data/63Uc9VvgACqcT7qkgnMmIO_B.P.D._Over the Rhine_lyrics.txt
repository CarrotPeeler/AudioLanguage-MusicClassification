1 ContributorB.P.D. LyricsYou're makin' a mess
Somethin' I can't fix
This time you're on your own
I'd make it alright
But I wouldn't get it right
I'm leavin' it alone
For cryin' outloud
Cryin' outloud
Cryin' out
You're cryin' out
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
You're makin' a mess
Is that what you do best?
Is madness just a hand-me-down?
It's anyone's guess
But I must confess
The performance isn't that profound

I'm waiting for the end
Waiting to begin again
You're makin' a mess
Somethin' you can't hide
A slow suicide
Just one bite at a time
I should love you less
But I can't I guess
Only God can save us now
Cryin' out
Cryin' out
Cryin' out
