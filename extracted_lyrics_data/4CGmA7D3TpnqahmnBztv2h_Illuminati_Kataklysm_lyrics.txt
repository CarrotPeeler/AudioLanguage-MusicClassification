3 ContributorsIlluminati LyricsThe time has come to rage insanity
Mortals beg to decive
Illuminiati strive to control
The seeds of generations
No more opposition, no more free will
We shall suffer from this higher power
For ages we've been manipulated
All our existence in vein
Solitude inside the intelligence
Of man is forever
Inside your mind we shall conquer all...
This time!
Illuminati... knowledge from the sons of sin
Illuminati... the world turns and hell burns
Hell burns... hell burns... hell burns...
We feel like empty souls lost in the dust
With our shadows embracing the surfaceYou might also likeEmbed
