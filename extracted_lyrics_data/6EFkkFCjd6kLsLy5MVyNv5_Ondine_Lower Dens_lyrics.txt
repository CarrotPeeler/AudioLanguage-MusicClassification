5 ContributorsOndine LyricsI think you'll understand
The way I feel can't be helped
You owe them nothing
It's time to walk away and leave this behind
Let go
I will treat you better
I will treat you better
I will treat you better
I'll treat you better
Hold on
Hold on
You can hold on as long as you know
You are leaving
You are leaving
I will treat you better
I will treat you better
I will treat you better
I'll treat you better
Hold, Hold on
