1 ContributorIn Death I Suffer LyricsIt rips me whole
In death I suffer
Get hot and cold
Gone forever
The carnage of
Spread into destruction
Not far to go
For straight up to heaven
It came from all sides
All sides
It came from all sides
All sides
Outnumbered
Outnumbered
Outnumbered
Outnumbered
War your face
Dirty grace
Faith erased
