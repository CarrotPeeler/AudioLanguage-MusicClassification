Oh, todos buenos
Oh, todos buenos
Oh, todos buenos
Come together everywhere
Celebrations in the air
Todos buenos
There's a-something going on
An action's getting strong
Todos buenos
Every angle in the street
It's a union of the beat
Todos buenos
And sensation in the crowd
And the music's getting loud
Todos buenos
Oh, todos buenos
Oh, todos buenos
Spirits flying high together
Joining in the song we made
We can reach the stars we're on our way
Union brings the sound of music in the Brotherhood of man
Voices singing out as one again
