5 ContributorsThe Rest Of My Life LyricsI started thinking bout the rest of my life
I found myself just looking out for trouble and strife
Someone with whom I'd spend the rest of my days
But if I ever said I wasn't set in my ways
Well then I guess you caught me lying to myself
What kind of fool doesn't think about it
What kind of fool doesn't think about it
You'd have to be a fool not to think about it
Am I
Gonna settle down
Am I gonna be
Someone who has to take the rest of my life
To settle down
Well I guess you caught me lying to myself
We'll make a man outta me
One thing I know about the rest of my life
I know that I'll be living it in Canada
I know I said I'll share the rest of my days
But I was only going through a phase
Am I
Gonna settle down
Am I gonna be
Someone who has to take the rest of my life
To settle down
Well I guess you caught me lying to myself

Someone who has to take the rest of my life
To settle down
