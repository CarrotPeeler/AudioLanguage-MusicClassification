3 ContributorsMe & Her Lyrics
I used to see her almost every day and when I didn't
I didn't feel so great
When we were together, I thought everything was better
Now I just have to pretend I just never cared that much

I hate her
And I love her

You ask me why I'm getting so upset
You don't understand a girl who's passionate for another girl
One day I think I love her then I think I want to kill her
You tell me to calm down, what is your fucking problem?

I hate her
And I love her

You said it once to me that girls are friends and friendships end
And memories all in my head of love so strong it'd knock you dead
They're thrown away like a melted ring and you just can't say anything
And even though I know that's not true I still don't know what to do
You might also like
I hate her
And I love her
I hate her
And I love her
I hate, I hate, I hate her
And I love herEmbed
