4 ContributorsCome Over Lyrics
After you go through the lights
Take the first left and the next right
Come in the back door c'mon inside
Don't mind the dog he won't bite

I'll tell you where to park your car
Around the corner in the dark
If he finds you in my home
You know he's gonna kill us both

Come over, come over, come over, come over
Come over, come over, come over, come over tonight
Yeah!

That's it, that's it, that's it
C'mon c'mon c'mon inside
Up the stairs, be right behind
Draw the shade, kill the light
We don't care tonight!
Not tonight

Come over, come over, come over, come over
Come over, come over, come over, come over tonight
Come over, come over, come over, come over
Come over, come over, come over, come over tonight
Come over, come over, come over, come over
Come over, come over, come over, come over tonight
Come over, come over, come over, come over
Come over, come over, come over, come over tonightYou might also likeEmbed
