3 ContributorsFrom The Rooftops LyricsShe hates my friends, my friends hate her
Takes all my time, makes me late for work
She’s got another guys name tattooed on her ass
My mom and dad say we’re moving too fast
She doesn’t like my band but the stickers on her car
She likes Star Trek, but I prefer Star Wars
Kissed me deadly, but she makes me alive
She’s the opposite of everything I need in my life
But when you know, you know…
Have you ever been so in love
You wanna shout it from the rooftops, from the rooftops
Ever been so in love
You wanna shout it from the rooftops, from the rooftops
(Woah-woah, whoa-ohhh)
(Woah-woah, whoa-ohhh)
I watch TV and she reads books
When bitches talk to me they get dirty looks from her
She really doesn’t mind when I drink my beer
And I really don’t care if she wears underwear
I rock all black and she can’t stand
That I dress like the dudes in Simple Plan
She’s all wrong, but it’s alright
She can be all wrong right by my side

You wanna shout it from the rooftops, from the rooftops

You wanna shout it from the rooftops, from the rooftops

You wanna shout it from the rooftops, from the rooftops…Embed
