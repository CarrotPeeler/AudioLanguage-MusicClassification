2 ContributorsIf Youâ€™re Watching LyricsI think I've found what I'm looking for...
Behind those eyes and open door...
That vacant stare, which I adore...
I'm your slut, and you're my whore...
Spare yourself the aching heart
And spare yourself the pain...
Let us just makebelieve
It's yesterday again...
And mother, if you're watching, look away...
And mother if you're wondering
But don't know what to say...
Mother if you're watching, look away...
Just look away...
I think i found what I'm looking for...
So hit the lights, and shut the door...
Listen carefully, here's the score...
I'm your slut, and you're my whore...
Spare yourself the aching heart
And spare yourself the pain...
Let us just makebelieve
It's yesterday again...

And mother if you're wondering
But don't know what to say...
Mother if you're watching, look away...
Just look away...
It sometimes makes me sick inside...
Ashamed of a life that I must hide...
I know you'll never understand...
I'm sorry there's no wedding band...
But deep inside there's still that child...
Innocent in a world gone wild...
Obediant of your moral code...
Scarred by a Christian overload...
But still I live by truth and love...
I still have hopes in the above...
I still have interest in the cross...
But mother if you're listening, shut it off...
Mother if you're watching, look away...
Just look away...
Just look away...
Just look away...Embed
