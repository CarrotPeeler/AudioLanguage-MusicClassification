9 ContributorsLazy Lyrics
I'm lazy when I'm lovin', I'm lazy when I play
I'm lazy with my girlfriend a thousand times a day
I'm lazy when I'm speaking, I'm lazy when I walk
I'm lazy when I'm dancin' and I'm lazy when I talk

I open up my mouth, air comes rushin' out
Nothin', doin' nada, never, how you like me now?
Wouldn't it be mad, wouldn't it be fine
Lazy, lucky lady, dancin', lovin' all the time?

Oh, I'm wicked and I'm lazy
Oh, don't you wanna save me?
Lazy, lazy
Lazy, lazy

Now some folks they got money and some folks lives are sweet
And some folks make decisions and some folks clean the streets, now
Imagine what it feels like, imagine how it sounds
If everything were perfect and everything works out

No tears are fallin' from my eyes
I'm keepin' all the pain inside
Now don't you wanna live with me?
I'm lazy as a man can be
You might also like
Oh, I'm wicked and I'm lazy
Oh, don't you wanna save me?
Oh, I'm wicked and I'm lazy
Oh, don't you wanna save me?
I'm lazy, lazy
Lazy, lazy

Imagine there's a girlfriend, imagine there's a job
Imagine there's an answer, imagine there's a god
Imagine I'm a devil, imagine I'm a saint
Lazy money, lazy sexy, lazy outta space

No tears are fallin' from my eyes
I'm keepin' all the pain inside
Now don't you wanna live with me?
I'm lazy as a man can be

Oh, I'm wicked and I'm lazy
Oh, don't you wanna save me?
Oh, I'm wicked and I'm lazy
Oh, don't you wanna save me?
Lazy when I work, lazy on the bed
Screamin' all you like, but it only fades away
I'm lazy when I'm prayin', lazy on the job
Got a lazy mind, a lazy eye, a lazy, lazy father

Hard men, hard lives
Hard keepin' it all inside
Good times, good God
So lazy I almost stop

Oh, I'm wicked and I'm lazy
Oh, don't you wanna save me?
Oh, I'm wicked and I'm lazy
Oh, don't you wanna save me?


I'm lazy, lazy
Lazy, lazy
Oh, I'm wicked and I'm lazy
Oh, don't you wanna save me?
Oh, I'm wicked and I'm lazy
Oh, don't you wanna save me?Embed
