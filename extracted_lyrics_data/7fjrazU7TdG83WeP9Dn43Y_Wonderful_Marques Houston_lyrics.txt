5 ContributorsWonderful Lyrics
Ooh, oh no
Oh baby, baby

Drama burning up my mind
She's a spot in the shade
Thirsty for her all the time
She's my cold lemonade, hey

If there was a way I could put it, make it
So that you could understand
That I'm only half a man without her, oh no
Gonna give my all, my heart, my mind, my soul, take it
Ain't no other word that can describe it
Baby, baby, you are

Wonderful
Ooh, your style, your vibe, your body
Amazing
Oh, just gotta tell somebody
Wonderful
Hey, to put it simply you are
Everything (Everything, babe)
You're so wonderful
You might also like
Music to my melody
You are where I belong, yeah
Girl, together you and me, baby
We're a beautiful song, oh, oh

If there was a way I could put it, make it
So that you could understand
That I'm only half a man without her, yeah
Gonna give my all, my heart, my mind, my soul, take it
Ain't no other word that can describe it
Baby, baby, you are

Wonderful
Ooh, your style, your vibe, your body
Amazing
Oh, just gotta tell somebody
Wonderful
Hey, to put it simply you are
Everything (Everything, yeah)
You're so wonderful, ooh, ooh

Baby, let's be up on the moon
Let's watch the stars get
Jealous of your shine (Hey babe)
Nothing that better for me (Nothing better, baby)
Girl, everything you do, wonderful, baby
Wonderful
Amazing (So amazing, baby)
Wonderful (Hey, to put it simply, girl, you are)
Everything (Everything, girl)
You're so wonderful
Wonderful (Oh baby)
Amazing (You are so amazing)
Wonderful
Everything (Everything, baby)
You're so wonderful

Yeah, yeahEmbed
