2 ContributorsLast Song About Satan Lyrics
I was at the Lion's Lair
And who should I sit next to there but Satan?
He ordered me a beer and he looked me in the eye
He said he was my friend, I knew that was a lie
He's the man behind my sins
I seem to fall because of him, goddamn, I hate him
So this is my last song about Satan

So I say "Lucifer, you piece of shit
I should kick your ass right where you sit
All the hell you put me through
My mother cries because of you"
Now, Satan didn't like that much
He said some words about fire and such
Then I found myself in burning hell
I wasn't feeling all so well
Well, this is my last song about Satan

Well, I must've gone back in time
About the time after Jesus died
He was down there preaching in that hole
To all us dark and lonely souls
And He said "Son, why are you here?
You should be back home drinking beer
Writing songs about God and glory
Don't use the Devil in your story"
You might also like
Well, this is my last song about Satan
No more songs about evil or filth or bile and booze
No more songs about my hell, I've nothing left to prove

So this is my last song about Satan
So this is my last song about Satan
Dwight Pentacost on the banjo!

Well, I felt a knock upon my head
And I woke back home in my bed
It was a dark and dismal morning
Was this some kind of godly warning?
So I said "That's it, I'm on the level
No more songs about the Devil"
Then I felt a little twinge
When I realized that my hair was singed

Well, this is my last song about Satan
No more songs about evil or filth or bile and booze
No more songs about my hell, I've nothing left to prove

This is my last song about Satan
This is my last song about Satan
Well, this is my last song about SatanEmbed
