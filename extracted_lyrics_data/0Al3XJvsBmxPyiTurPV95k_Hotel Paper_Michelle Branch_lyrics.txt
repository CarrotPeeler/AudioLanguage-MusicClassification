1 ContributorHotel Paper Lyrics
I write mostly on hotel paper
Knowing that my thoughts will never leave this room
I'd be out of line telling you, "leave her"
So I lie lonely surrounded by you, oh (By you, oh)

Lately, I can't be happy for no one
They think I need some time to myself, oh
I try to smile, but I can't remember
I know tomorrow there'll be nothing else, oh

And I, I wanted to be
Giving you everything that she's not giving
And I, I wanted to see
'Cause I didn't believe what I'd been hearing

You turned out to be more than I bargained for
And I can tell that you need to get away
Forgive me if I admit that I'd love to love you
We both realized it way too late, oh

And I, I wanted to be
Giving you everything that she's not giving
And I, I wanted to see
'Cause I didn't believe what I'd been hearing
You might also like
Maybe this wind blowing in
Just came from the ocean
I write mostly on hotel paperEmbed
