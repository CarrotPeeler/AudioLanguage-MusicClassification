Back in the dark room, he's waiting for you
Back in the dark room, he's waiting for you
Nursing a pain he designed and created for you
Back in the dark room, he's waiting for you

Here comes the latest heartbreak line
Straight for the weakness he goes
The latest heartbreak line
Well, this one was meant for you

Cry, cry, he'll try anything to get you
And he won't be pacified
Gonna whine like a child 'till he gets his time with you
Crawling the floor, there's no risk, there's no distance to fall
No, he just won't be denied
Cry, cry, he'll try anything to get you

Here comes the latest heartbreak line
Straight for the weakness he goes
The latest heartbreak line
Well, this one was meant for you
The latest heartbreak line
The latest heartbreak line
The latest heartbreak line
This one was meant for you

Back in the dark room, he's waiting for you
Back in the dark room, he's waiting for you
Nursing a pain he designed and created for you
Back in the dark room, he's waiting for you

Here comes the latest heartbreak line
Straight for the weakness he goes
The latest heartbreak line
Well, this one was meant for you
The latest heartbreak line
The latest heartbreak line
The latest heartbreak line
This one was meant for you1Embed
