Sweet
Must be the new word for water, for water
Hands can't even hold a thing
The air tastes useless, the air tastes useless

Ooh, can't get enough of this
All that is thirst
All that is thirst
Ooh, playing new Hide and Seek
Keep moving still
Keep moving still

Clouds I've tried to carry
Upon my shoulder, upon my shoulder
Keep gentle and patient
Befriend the weather, befriend the weather

Ooh, can't get enough of this
All that is thirst
All that is thirst
Ooh, playing new Hide and Seek
Keep moving still
Keep moving still

All that is thirst
All that is thirst
Ooh, playing new Hide and Seek
Keep moving still
Keep moving still


Ooh, can't get enough of this
All that is thirst
All that is thirst
Ooh, playing new Hide and Seek
Keep moving still
Keep moving still
Ooh, can't get enough of this
All that is thirst
All that is thirst
Ooh, playing new Hide and Seek
Keep moving still
Keep moving still
Ooh, can't get enough of this
All that is thirst
All that is thirst
Ooh, playing new Hide and Seek
Keep moving still
Keep moving stillEmbed
