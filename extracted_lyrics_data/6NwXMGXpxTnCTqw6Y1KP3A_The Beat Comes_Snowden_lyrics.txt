2 ContributorsThe Beat Comes LyricsSuch a hustle, all the hands in your pie
Swallow all of it, wash it down with pride
Send the shivers, up and down their spines
Save the pulp, save the pulp
Macerated down to the bone
Almost hate it, but I know that you don't
Caught in waves of headless spinning
Bet on red but black keeps hitting
Bob your head 'til the beat comes
Red Corvette and lithium
Long winter, you went south
There's no way to go back now 
Bend a little, get what you can get
All I have won't cover half of the rent
Tried to swallow but it just couldn't
Save the pulp, save the pulp
Macerated down to the bone
Almost hate it, but I know that you don't
Caught in waves of headless spinning
Bet on red but black keeps hitting
Bob your head 'til the beat comes
Red Corvette and lithium
Long winter, you went south
There's no way to go back now
You might also likeBob your head 'til the beat comes
Keep your mouth off the cannon
I shiver down south
There's no way to go back now
There is no way, no way to go back now 
You can never, never come back now
Bob your head 'til the beat comes
Red Corvette and lithium
Long winter, you went south
There's no way to go back now
Bob your head 'til the beat comes
Keep your mouth off the cannon
I shiver down south
There's no way to go back now
There's no way to go back now Embed
