17 ContributorsWhite Slavery Lyrics
I make a call
So far to fall
Restless craving
Inundating

The summer snow
But it's not cold
Once it's tested
Thus infected

I've lost myself again
I've lost myself again
It's a nightmare, but it's clear
It will end, but when?

The break of day
I rot away
With every breath
I pray for death (Death)

I've lost myself again
I've lost myself again
It's a nightmare, but it's clear
It will end, but when?

Let me say, Pepsi Generation
A few lines of misinformation
Watch your money, flow away, oh, so quick
To kill yourself properly, coke is it

I've lost myself again
I've lost myself again
It's a nightmare, but it's clear
It will end, but when?

Let me say, Pepsi Generation
A few lines of misinformation
Watch your money, flow away, oh, so quick
To kill yourself properly, coke is itEmbed
