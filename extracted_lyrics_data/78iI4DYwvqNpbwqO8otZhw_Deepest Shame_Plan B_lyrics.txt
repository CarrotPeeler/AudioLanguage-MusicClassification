19 ContributorsDeepest Shame Lyrics
There's no way back from here on out
Only one place left to go
One place left to go now

She's crashing like an aeroplane
Through a sky of thunderstorm and rain
On autopilot, she's a fly and aim
For the target, kamikaze, go up in flames
This life is taught she must pay
Pay the price for her mistakes
I guess she only has herself to blame
And to her that's the deepest shame

There's no way back from here on out
Only one place left to go
One place left to go now

She was once a princess, but now she's a mess
A fiend for a fix like the rest
Eliciting sex when pocketless
But she was a sweet thing, nevertheless
Back in the day, abused as a child
She was always likely to end up this way
The past lived in the dark parts of the brain
And only heroin seemed to take away the pain
So she folded the foil and lit the flame
Inhale, exhale out once again
She's on the game, they all know her face
And her standard going rate, just not her name
With only herself to blame, she lives this hell
But there's a millions other girls just like Michelle
Out in the streets with nothing else to sell
To these desperate males other than themselves
You might also like
There's no way back from here on out
Only one place left to go
One place left to go now
There's no way back from here on out
Only one place left to go
One place left to go now

I've been walking along this dead-end road
For so long now, I just can't tell
If there's any way back the way I came
Though what blocks my path is the deepest shame
I've been dragging myself to the lowest of low
For such a while, I just don't know
If the path I take is something I can change
But what stands in my way is the deepest shame

There's no way back from here on out
Only one place left to go
One place left to go now
There's no way back from here on out
Only one place left to go
One place left to go now
There's no way back from here on out
Only one place left to go
One place left to go now3Embed
