1 ContributorFather and Son Lyrics
Ooo-ooo-ooo-ooh, ooo-ooo-ooo-ooh
Ooo-ooo-ooo-ooh, ooo-ooo-ooo-ooh

My old man used to take me to the footy
Now it's me takes him
Been barracking for the Sainters
Season on end, season cold and grim
Every season we'd pretend that we were the great pretenders
And watch in the rain, getting done again by the real contenders

Oh hear the cry, ring out to the Moorabbin sky
Nothing can stop it

Winmar, Winmar, Winmar to Lockett
Winmar, Winmar, Winmar to Lockett
Ooo-ooo-ooo-ooh, ooo-ooo-ooo-ooh

Those Collingwood bastards did us by a point
The day my mother died
When I told Dad, he shook his head and said
"Makes you want to cry"
Winmar, you're a football genius, and oh, let me tell you, son
Remember my old man, 'cause he wasn't referring to Mum
You might also like
You've got my heart, when you've got the leather
For the gods' sake, don't drop it! Yeah

Winmar, Winmar, Winmar to Lockett
Winmar, Winmar, Winmar to Lockett

Oh, Dad'll be gone in ten season's time, and you know they can
Build rockets that can think, have prime time TV, napalm Vietnam
Just for my Dad, they could give us a flag, who says they oughtn't?
It ain't a matter of life and death, it's more important

Here comes Nicky! Tony's broken free!
Winmar to Lockett!

Winmar, Winmar, Winmar to Lockett
Winmar, Winmar, Winmar to Lockett
Winmar, Winmar, Winmar to Lockett (Winmar to Lockett!)
Winmar, Winmar, Winmar to LockettEmbed
