5 ContributorsBetter Must Come Lyrics
Ye-ye-yeah
Hmm-hmm

I've been trying a long-long time, still I can't make it
Everything I try to do seems to go wrong
It seems I have done something wrong
Why they're trying to keep me down
Who God bless, no one curse
Thank God I'm not the worst

Better must come one day
Better must come, they can't conquer me
Better must come, yeah

I've been trying a long-long time but I can't make it
No one to give me a helping hand
They only try to keep me down
Who God bless, no one curse
Thank God I'm not the worst
Oh, my people, get and see
They're trying to take advantage of me
You might also like
Better must come, better must come
Better must come one day
Better must come, ye-ye-ye-ye-yeah


I've been trying a long-long time, still I can't make it
Everything I try to do seems to go wrong
It seems I have done something wrong
Why they're trying to keep me down
Who God bless, no one curse
Thank God I'm not the worst

Better must come one day
Better must come, they can't conquer me
Better must come one day, better must come
Oh, better must come one day, better must come one day
A better must come, a better must come, better must comeEmbed
