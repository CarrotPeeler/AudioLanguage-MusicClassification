6 ContributorsBitchâ€™s Brew Lyrics
I tell you kinky
You foxy little flirt
I caught you in the biar path
Lifting up your skirt
Well let me tell ya now
What you been doing in the briar patch
What you been doing in your little skirt
Got...

You've been fooling with the Bitch's Brew
You know the things I told you not to do
You fell into the briar patch
Ain't nothing gonna save your ass

Remember the things you said (Ass)
The saving and the screams for bread (Ass)
And now you just walked away (Ass)
So take it away, all the way

Oh, you're fooling with the Bitch's Brew
That ain't the thing you ought to fool with
Now you keep your fingers out of there, honey
You know that ain't no there
You might also like
The way that you really feel (There)
Down the parts on the way you deal (There)
Where the witch is sight (There)
And the things that you fight (There)
(Oh God)

You've been messing with the Bitch's Brew
Now don't you know who you're talking to
Say you're talking to the Bitch's who
Tell me you really never cared

The Voodoo man eyes of fire (Cared)
The Hoodoo man most desire (Cared)
The Bitches are out and smooth (Cared)
Tell from the light of the moon
(Yodle-lay-lay-lay, yeah, yeah, yeah, come on)


I've been thinking
Ran my hands through the sense of time
Yeah, and I've been drinking
Just to make this here song rhyme
You're fooling with the Bitch's Brew
Now don't you, don't you, don't you, don't you
Don't go fooling with the Bitch's Brew, ha, ha, ha, ha
Don't go fooling with the Bitch's Brew
Don't be fooling with me now
Don't go fooling with the Bitch's Brew, Bitch's Brew, Bitch's Brew, Bitch's Brew, Bitch's Brew
Bitch's Brew, Bitch's Brew, oh yeah
Bitch's Brew, Bitch's Brew, Bitch's, Bitch's, Bitch's
