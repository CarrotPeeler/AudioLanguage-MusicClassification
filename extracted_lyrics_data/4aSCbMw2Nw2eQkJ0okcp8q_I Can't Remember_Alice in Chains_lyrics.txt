Ooh

"Turn around," you say
'Scuse the 'tude, but I haven't eaten today
And my eyes are turning grey
"What's your name?"

I can't remember
I can't remember

Bring me down, you try
Feel the pain and keep it all in 'til you die
Without eyes, you cannot cry
"Who's to blame?"

I can't remember
I can't

Remember identity
The visions in my mind from screamin' at me
And mama, mama, ooh
My angry brains of infancy

Knocked down, but I have enough hate to breathe
Down your throat and steal your energy
You took everything but my will to be
Now the loss of your god won't make me bleed

I, I am alive3Embed
