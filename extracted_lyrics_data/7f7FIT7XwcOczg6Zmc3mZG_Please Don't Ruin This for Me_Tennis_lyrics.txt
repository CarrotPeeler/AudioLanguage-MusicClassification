7 ContributorsPlease Donâ€™t Ruin This for Me Lyrics
Have you heard a serpent speak?
Would you lift a veil to take a peek?
Hold a mirror up to me
Mirror back my unbelief

Please don't ruin this for me
I have everything I need
Please don't ruin this for me
I have everything I need, yeah

Build an alter, stoke the flame
Speak half truths that sound arcane
All my dreams so deeply hidden
Rise up to my throat unbidden
All the comforts I forsake
Like afterlives and divine fate

Forge your own way merrily
Fill the world with new meaning

Please don't ruin this for me
I have everything I need
Please don't ruin this for me
I have everything I need, yeahYou might also likeEmbed
