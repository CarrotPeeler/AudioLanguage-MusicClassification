1 ContributorLittle star LyricsFrom another world
From another place
I'm just so glad that I found you
Just so glad that I found you
La, da, da, da, da
Da, da, da, da, da, da
I'm just so glad that I got you
Spin me out to space
Take me to the moon
Twinkle, twinkle little star
I just wanna play in the galaxy
My little star
That's what you are, girl
Ultra-violet, oh
I can see you shine from so far away
Magnetising
I just wanna pull up close to you
From another world
From another place
I'm just so glad that I found you
Just so glad that I found you
La, da, da, da, da
Da, da, da, da, da, da
I'm just so glad that I got you
Spin me out to space
You might also likeTake me to the moon
Twinkle, twinkle little star
I just wanna play in the galaxy
(I just wanna play with you)
My little star
That's what you are, girl
Time travel to find you
My uni surrounds you
When we get together
I can feel the pressure rising
It's you, me, astro-lovers
Light years away
You're my supernova
A halo in the hay
From another world
From another place
I'm just so glad that I found you
Just so glad that I found you
(I can see you shining)
La, da, da, da, da
Da, da, da, da, da, da
(From another place)
Spin me out to space
Take me to the moon
Ah, you can take me to the moon
Twinkle, twinkle little star
I just wanna play in the galaxy
(I just wanna play with you)
My little starEmbed
