You gotta treat me gently or I'll go off in your hands
Give me your affection, girl, I'll take you up so high
Every day's like the Fourth of July
Every day's like the Fourth of July
I am like a bottle rocket, coursing through the sky
Only you can stop it but you know you're playing with fire
Double-barreled shotgun when I'm begging for a lie
Every day's like the Fourth of July
Every day's like the Fourth of July
Here I come
You're about to set me off
Straight up, take you to the maximum
I am like a bottle rocket, burstin' at the seams
Slip me in your pocket, babe, I promise not to scream
Mellow down, easy when I'm burnt up down to black
Every day's like the Fourth of July
Every day's like the Fourth of July
Here I come
You're about to set me off
Straight up, take you to the maximum

Go on and set me off
Yeah, go on and set me off
Go on and set me off
I am like a bottle rocket, burnin' at both ends
You gotta treat me gently or I'll go off in your hands
Straight up, take you to the maximum
Here I come
You're about to set me off
Straight up, take you to the maximumEmbed
