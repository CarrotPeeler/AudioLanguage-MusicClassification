2 ContributorsGypsy Blood LyricsThere's gypsy blood running through this heart of mine
Burned my home, burned my bridges, left my friends behind
For you – I said I'd do it for you
But I'm always hungry for a look, yeah I long to please
Got no loyalty and I live to tease
Oh yeah
Pouring salt water on an open sore
You can't escape when my ego is blocking the door
Wish I'd the nerve to feel I deserve you
But something inside want's to tear you down
Dishing out blows, heavy hits to the heart
I'm a black hole man – now you're in the dark
Wish I'd the nerve to feel I deserve you
But something inside want's to tear you down
So many layers of camouflage
Something evil in me wants to sabotage
I'm a black hole man – now you're in the dark
Oh, black hole – tearing at your heartYou might also likeEmbed
