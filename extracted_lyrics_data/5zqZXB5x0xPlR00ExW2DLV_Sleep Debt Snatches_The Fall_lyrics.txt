2 ContributorsSleep Debt Snatches LyricsOut of the air sometimes in fitful sleep
Snap right up, lean out of the bed
Pivot your legs, shake your head
Take an easy breath
Think how great God's golden assurance is
In set-backs and great success
Got bad dreams through sleep debt
Hold the grip, make a mark on your head
Your body and legs take a rightful rest
While you're left to Hell's dispatches
Grip the mind, kids, close the hatches
Here are some sleep debt snatches....You might also likeEmbed
