4 ContributorsLips Like Morphine Lyrics
I want a girl with lips like morphine
Knock me out every time they touch me
I wanna feel a kiss just crush me
And break me down

Knock me out (Knock me out)
Knock me out (Knock me out)
'Cause I've waited for all my life
To be here with you tonight

I want a girl with lips like morphine
Blow a kiss that leaves me gasping
And I wanna feel that lightning strike me
And burn me down

Knock me out (Knock me out)
Knock me out (Knock me out)
'Cause I've waited for all my life
To be here with you tonight

Just put me on my back
Knock me out again
You might also like
I want a girl with lips like morphine (Lips like morphine)
Knock me out every time they touch me (Every time they touch me)
I want a girl with lips like morphine (Lips like morphine)
To knock me out

See I've waited for all my life
To be here with you tonight
Just put me on my back
Knock me out againEmbed
