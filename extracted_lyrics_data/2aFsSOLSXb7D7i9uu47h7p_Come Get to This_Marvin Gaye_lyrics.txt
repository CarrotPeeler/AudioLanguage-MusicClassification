Girl, you've been gone away a real long time
Oh, I nearly went out of my mind
Waitin' on you, oh, I miss your loving
When you left me, baby, you did it

Ah baby, come here
Let me caress you, ah, ow
Baby, your letters, ow, told me what you missed
Come here, sugar, and get to this
Ah baby, I want you here
I want to do something freaky to you
I want to feel what I've felt a longâ€”
Ah come, baby, and get to this

Ooh, remember, baby
How you made me feel just like a king?
Ah, I can't wait, baby
I'm ready for you to start doing the things
I'm trying to blow your mind, you're so fine
So petite, oh, candy sweet
Ah, I can't wait
Come here, come here, baby, get to this, ooh
You might also like
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Sweet love, sweet love, oh
So good to have you back, ooh
Everything else will have to get back
Oh, nothing's changed
You're still sweet as morning rain
And I'm standing, ready to
Love you, baby, make it good to you

Oh, I need your love
Don't make me wait, I can't wait
Oh, I'm so impatient for your love
Come here, sweet, sweet baby, get to this, ooh

Girl, I know you've been gone a long time
You nearly blew my mind, baby
Girl, you've been gone for so long
I'm so glad, babe, so glad that you're home
Oh, baby4Embed
