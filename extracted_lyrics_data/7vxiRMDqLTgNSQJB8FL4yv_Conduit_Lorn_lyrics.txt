2 ContributorsCONDUIT Lyrics
 with the youth in your eyes
I tried to lift you off the floor but you had died
I'm alone

 with the youth in your eyes
I tried to lift you off the floor but you had died
I'm alone

I'm alone

 with the youth in your eyes
I tried to lift you off the floor but you had died
I'm alone

 with the youth in your eyes
I tried to lift you off the floor but you had died
I'm alone

I'm alone
I'm alone
I'm alone
I'm alone
I'm aloneYou might also likeEmbed
