17 ContributorsSing It (The Life of Riley) Lyrics
See, it all started with my dad
If he rated anythin', I always hated it, yeah
With one catch the beauty of life
He played Grandmaster Flash and The Furious Five
It was "The Message" and I guess that meant more
Than anything I was given from him, maybe the rhythm within
Or given my similar sisters
Livin' for the resistance, we'd listen
To systems pumping out, "Jump Around"
To Rage Against Machine or "Fuck the Police"
By NWA, we played the Gravediggaz
To Nirvana and Smelling Like Teen Spirit
And they sing it
With every little bit of last breath that is in them
Yes and they listen, yes and they love it, yes and they live it
Yes they

Sing along, they sing along
A new day, a new dawn
A place to forget about the world you're on
And get the whole crowd sing along, they sing along
You can't change it, it's set in stone
And I ain't saying we need to get along
Just let the whole crowd sing it
You might also like
It all started as a young'n, hangin' around at Hunter's flat
Once where the warriors and monsters rapped
I sat back takin' it in, destined to win it
Had all of SBX as my next of kin
It was a blessing that manifested
From being a guest on Done DL, that and the help
From the Hydey, in ninety-nine I had an I.D
Only seventeen but sayin' I was nineteen
Hide when the cops would rock in
Nothing could stop me watching, I wouldn't give in
'Cause from the beginnin', I was livin' for the sound
When you walk into a room and the whole crowd singing along

They sing along, they sing along
A new day, a new dawn
A place to forget about the world you're on
And get the whole crowd sing along, they sing along
You can't change it, it's set in stone
And I ain't saying we need to get along
Just let the whole crowd sing it

Well, well, look what we got here
We here to lock ears like ruggedous rottweilers
And well then, why would I stop here?
The day I stopped hearing the haters, it got
Clearer, and I'm feared as a bearded Ned Kelly
If I would stop selling, could never just stop telling 'em my story
Pauly walked up in here with nothing
Enough to never trust another loving Jimmy Loughnan
'Cause I got these friends that will stick around
If it ever ended were there in the beginning
And then these friends in the crowd
I'm surrounded by, together we all
Sing along, they sing along
A new day, a new dawn
A place to forget about the world you're on
And get the whole crowd sing along, they sing along
You can't change it, it's set in stone
And I ain't saying we need to get along
Just let the whole crowd sing it1Embed
