2 ContributorsButterflies Drowned in Wine LyricsButterflies drowned in wine
I'm headed into town
Where up is up and down is down
None of this fumbling around
Phantom fingers straighten a phantom tie
I'm going to talk to some people there
Forget everything I'm told
In one ear and out the other
An eagle flies right through my mind
The shadow skims across the land
Some people add and some subtract
I love an expert, I hate a hack
You've got to bust up a sidewalk sometimes
To get people to gather round
And I'm prepared to do whatever it takes
I'm prepared to do whatever it takes
For temporary temporary brother/sisterhood
Temporary temporary brother/sisterhood
Move the tables and the chairs aside and give me some room
I'm gonna show you something you won't soon forget
