4 ContributorsSo Damn Happy Lyrics
My love
Oh baby, my love
It's always been you
You make me so damn happy
I thought I knew who you were
Oh, but after twice around
I can say exactly
Of course, this is love
And I never say (and I never say)
I didn't care about you
You sweet thing (you sweet thing)
But you can't pretend the serious burn
That I feel in my heart, and there it's
A wedding ring, oh

I got to get over you
Ooh, but it's so hard
'Cause you're my everything
Baby, when I think of us when
It's in the tea leaves
That we won't get our turn

You can't always have what you want
You have to take the bitter with the sweet
I'm a big girl and I know what I want
Three nights in your arms would be
A super treat
Give it to me, baby
You might also like
I gotta get over you
Yeah, but it's so hard
Because you're my everything
Oh, when I think of us when
I know it's in the tea leaves
That we won't get our turn

Oh baby; ooh baby
Hey boy, I'm so damn happy
Ooh baby, it's always been you
Hey boy, I'm so damn happy right now, baby
Ooh, ooh baby, you
Hey boy, I'm so damn happy
Ooh, it's always been you
Hey boy, I'm so damn happy
I remember the moment
Yeah, baby; yeah, boy, mmm-hmm
Hey boy, I'm so damn happy
Ooh, it's always been you
Hey boy, I'm so damn happy
Ooh, ooh baby, you
Hey boy, I'm so damn happy
Ooh, it's always been you
Hey boy, I'm so damn happy
Ooh, ooh baby, you
Hey boy, I'm so damn happy
Ooh, it's always been you
Hey boy...Embed
