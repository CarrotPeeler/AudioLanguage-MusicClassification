Who could have known you'd be so real
But unrelenting, the grip that lives around you
Give me a sign, so I can rescue you
And save the day, yeah
Bring in the rain, bring in the shine
Let it go stop wasting time, I'm calling out to you
Don't chase the sun, don't race the sky
Let it go stop wasting time
And I'm calling out to you, I'm calling out to you
Fascinating, how moments feel sublime
Seems like I'm glowing when you're near
But unavailing, when you pay no mind
Or your twisting every other line
Baby say the words I'll rescue you
And make you mine
Bring in the rain, bring in the shine
Let it go stop wasting time, I'm calling out to you
Don't chase the sun, don't race the sky
Let it go stop wasting time
And I'm calling out to you, I'm calling out to you
Come rain come shine, stop wasting time
Come rain come shine, you will be mine
Come rain come shine, stop wasting time
Come rain come shine, you will be mine

Let it go stop wasting time, I'm calling out to you
Don't chase the sun, don't race the sky
Let it go stop wasting time
And I'm calling out to you, I'm calling out to you
Bring in the rain, bring in the shine
Let it go stop wasting time, I'm calling out to you
Don't chase the sun, don't race the sky
Let it go stop wasting time
And I'm calling out to you, I'm calling out to youEmbed
