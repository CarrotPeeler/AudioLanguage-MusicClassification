3 ContributorsSit Down and Cry Lyrics
Baby, no one could have told me
How could they have told me
When they didn't know?

I'd sit down and cry, baby
I'd sit down and cry, baby
Sit down and cry my heart out
Over you, oh

No one, no one could have warned me
That you would scar me yeah
And hurt me so bad

And that I'd sit down and cry, baby
I'd sit down and cry, baby
I'd sit down and cry my heart out
Over you

Oh, who would ever believe?
That lips sweet as yours
Sweeter than the honey
From the bees
You might also likeTell, who would ever believe?
That those same sweet lips
Would lie, lie like
Lie like you lied to me, yeah
Baby, no one, no one could ever told me
I wouldn't hear it
That you would have sold me, yeah
Down the river so fast

I'd sit down and cry, baby
I'd sit down and cry, baby
Sit down and cry my heart out
Over you, oh
And that I'd sit down and cry, baby
I'd sit down and cry, baby
I'd sit down and cry my heart out
Over youEmbed
