1 Contributor(Angry Kids Of The World) Unite LyricsListen closely boys and girls
'cause it's time to change the world
You've been angry way to long
You've got to put your hands in the air
You've got to put your hands in the air
Angry boys and girls
UNITE!
Listen closely boys and girls
In this singular event
You can't afford your loneliness
You've got to put your hands in the air
You've got to put your hands in the air
Lonely boys and girls
UNITE!
We have ways of making you sing
We have ways of making you dance
Sometimes you win
Sometimes you loose
But it's my heart
And I'll give to you
What I've got
And I'll be forever cheering by your sideYou might also likeEmbed
