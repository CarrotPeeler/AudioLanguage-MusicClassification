1 ContributorButterflysoup Lyrics
One hundred times I’ve failed
To get you off my mind
So I still think of you
I buried myself deeply
Underneath golden leaves
No one can find me out
So quiet times have passed so fast
Feel fall comes again

Time and time again
I ask myself where I belong
What I am to you
Slowly fall asleep
I have the same dream of you
As if you were here (As if it were true?)

One thousand days I've spent
Sleepless nights alone
Afraid to fall asleep
I'm still hauntеd by the past
Tell me how to forgеt
I wish you felt regret
You might also likeNow I just keep wondering
Nothing has changed at all

Time and time again
I ask myself where I belong
What I am to you
Slowly fall asleep
I have the same dream of you
As if you were here (As if it were true?)


Time and time again
I ask myself where I belong
What I am to you
Slowly fall asleep
I have the same dream of you
As if you were here
