3 ContributorsDream of Life Lyrics
I'm with you always
You're ever on my mind
In a light to last a whole life through

Each way I turn the sense of you surrounds
In every step I take in all I do
Your thoughts your schemes
Captivate my dreams
Everlasting ever new

Sea returns to sea
And sky to sky
In a life of dream am I
When I'm with you
With you

Deep in my heart
How the presence of you shines
In a light to last a whole life through
I recall the wonder of it all
Each dream of life I'll share with you

Sea returns to sea
And sky to sky
In a life of dream am I
When I'm with you
With you

I'm with you always
You're ever on my mind
In a light to last a whole life through

The hand above turns those leaves of love
All and all a timeless view
Each dream of life
Flung from paradise
Everlasting ever new
Dream of Life
