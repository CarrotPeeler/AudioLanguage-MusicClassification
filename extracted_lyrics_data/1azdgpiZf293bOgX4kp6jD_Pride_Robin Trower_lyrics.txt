2 ContributorsPride LyricsI got no frustrations playin' on my mind
No complications, I guess I'm doin' fine
I got no money, can't even pay my rent
I end up on one thing, and to me its heaven sent
I've got my pride, hiding inside
I've got my pride
Tell me tell me now
I've got my pride, hiding inside
I've got my pride
I saw a man this mornin' sitting both sides of the fence
Being diplomatic, had lost his common sense
If he had his wits about him, you'de know he was a fool
'cause if you can't find no solution, then you got to play it cool
I've got my pride, hiding inside
I've got my pride
Let me hear ya say it babe
I've got my pride, hiding inside
I've got my pride
I've got my pride, hiding inside
I've got my pride
I've got my pride, hiding inside
I've got my prideSee Robin Trower LiveGet tickets as low as $68You might also likeEmbed
