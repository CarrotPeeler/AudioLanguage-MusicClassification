5 ContributorsWhat Can I Do Lyrics
What can I do to make you stay
I really don't want you to go away (ohh)
Take a little time and see I've changed
I really love you

There was just a day
I was tripping babe
Playing silly games
Doing stupid things
I didn't know it then
And you had a friend
Tell me baby how can we begin again?

What can I do to make you stay
I really don't want you to go away
Take a little time and see I've changed
I really love you

Without you in my life
All I do is cry
Gotta feeling in my heart
It just won't die
I really want you
What am I to do?
I really really wanna be down with you
I was a fool
This is true
But let me prove my love to you (oh)
You might also like
What can I do to make you stay (make you stay)
I really don't want you to go away (ohh)
Take a little time and see I've changed
I really love you (really, love you baby)

What can I do? (baby what can I do...?)
What can I say? (baby what can I say...?)
To make you wanna stay (yeah)
Do you need some time? (do you need some time)
To make up your mind? (please make up your mind)
I'm begging you to change your mind (ohh)

Baby!
What can I do to make you stay (make you stay)
I really don't want you to go away (ohh)
Take a little time and see I've changed
I really love you (really, love you baby)
What can I do to make you stay (can you stay)
I really don't want you to go away (need your love)
Take a little time and see I've changed (yesterday)
I really love you (really, love you baby)Embed
