11 ContributorsCadet Lyrics
Oh shit it’s Cadet again
That story telling emotional yute
Probably chatting shit again, who says he’s grime
But don’t sit with them
Well is he rap or grime bro it depends
Rap? No and grime not really
Cause he ain’t got a bar about shutting down sets
Or a flow that sounds like skiba-diba-di-di
But anyway I know what you came for
Just gimme a sec
Wallahi, I’mma’ go ham bro
But first let a nigga’ stretch
(Oi cadet, your phone)
Shantel again init
Yeah
Let her know imma call her back
Anyway let me do me, it’s routine
Came around with the baton like I’m Akabusi
Look none of these niggas in the game
Can’t fuck with me in my face
I be looking at niggas like who’s he, look
Ask about me I’m the best on road
Drake’s album, I’m known in west on road
Your girls name Nintendo Pad
Wii controller, Fuck up your views nigga’
Oh shit, he’s right these kinda punches
Have a nigga sitting in a fight
Can’t tell me about power
Until you’ve ghosted man with a tommy in the ride
Yeah I got tekkerz still
The gyaldem say I’m impressive still
And they love the Bill Cosby swag
Ya’ get it? I got that sex-on-a-pill
The seven was like BBK
Come I’mma show man how
I woulda had your shorty in the crib
Getting mad frisky in the couch
See Krept, was like Jme
I durag and get a man down in the south
But Konan was like skepta
Cause if kone-itch-he-wa, knock somethin’ out
I’m feeling like the young flame now
But this one you won’t catch
Cause in beef there’s 2 options bro
You either lean or throw back
You see my left hand I call Blade Brown
Cause man can get boxed over a bag
And my right hand I call Giggs now
Cause’ if I land lord it’s a wrap
Yeah I came up from that pavement
Tryna’ avoid these cages
I got set up chicks that will Kane your bro
But that don’t make them undertakers
You might not see me on stages
And you might not see me on playlists
(You weren’t nominated or a Rated Award)
I guess that makes man underrated
You see my career I’d never contemplate with
But my success has been understated
I’m better than half these fucking yutes
That got bars but they never say shit
Even hear my tune when I’m raving
The back of the club, it wants dance
But you couldn’t whine with my gyal
I will pop corn over one dance
I’m just getting started
I got that flame, I ain’t tryna’ pass it
I’ve run a man down like Joe Budden
Have your whole neck back and your head departed
Around me rap yutes never start shit
Cause they know Cadet is not the target
And this is not the So Gone Challenge
There’s no chance a rapper starts it
Niggas know me man I’m bar retarded
Do any giggs, talkin’ the hardest
And in the ends, there’s super snares
Cause thats where them man blown the cartridge
You better mind how y’all are all talkin’
And watch when shit comes out of your gob
Cause the magic words in Abracadabra
Even though man don’t talk, man rob
You might also likeNo you ain’t better than me, bruddah no’
And no you can’t flex like me, bruddah no’
And no you can’t shut down the rave
Just by saying his name, no bruddah no’
No you ain’t cadet, cadet
No you ain’t cadet, cadet
No you ain’t cadet, c-c-cadet, no you ain’t cadet cadet no’1Embed
