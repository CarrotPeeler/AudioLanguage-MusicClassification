Laudate omnes gentes laudate
Magnificat in secula
Et anima mea laudate
Magnificat in secula

Happy nation living in a happy nation
Where the people understand
And dream of perfect man
Situation leading to sweet salvation
For the people, for the good
For mankind, brotherhood

We're traveling in time

Ideas by man
And only that will last
And over time
We've learned from the past
That no man's fit
To rule the world alone
A man will die
But not his ideas
You might also like
Happy nation
Living in a happy nation
Where the people understand
And dream of perfect man
Situation leading to sweet salvation
For the people, for the good
For mankind, brotherhood

We're traveling in time
Traveling in time

Tell them we've gone too far
Happy nation
Tell them we've gone too far
Happy nation
Come through and I will dance with you
Happy nation
Tell them we've gone too far
Happy nation
Come through and I will dance with you
Happy nation
Tell them we've gone too far
Hmm
Come through and I will dance with you
Happy nation living in a happy nation
Where the people understand
And dream of perfect man
Situation leading to sweet salvation
For the people, for the good
For mankind, brotherhood

Happy nation
