6 ContributorsPieces LyricsWalk that crooked line
I see you try to beat the one step
Into the middle of the circle
Try and try you ask me to answer
All the time I gave you a reason
(Why?)
You want me to show you
(Why?)
Ask again
Ask again
(Then you'll see)
Why, I wanna feel the same as you
(Ask again)
(Ask again)
(And I'll show you)
The circle's broken down
(I don't care if you blame me)
I don't care if you hate me
I don't care if you trust me
I don't care if you blame me
(Now the circle is broken)
(Ahhhhh, I can feel you)
Scream at the thought of my name
(Stop)
Walking around talking shit again
Will you remember my face when
(I reach out and touch you)
See Sevendust LiveGet tickets as low as $53You might also like(You'll know)
Why, I'll never be the same as you
(Ask again)
(Is it in you fuck?)
The circle's broken down
(I don't care if you blame me)
I don't care if you hate me
I don't care if you trust me
I don't care if you blame me
(Now the circle is broken)
(Ahhhh, Now it's my turn)
The circle's broken down
(The circle is broken)
I don't care if you hate me
I don't care if you trust me
(Next)
I don't care if you blame me
(I just don't give a shit)Embed
