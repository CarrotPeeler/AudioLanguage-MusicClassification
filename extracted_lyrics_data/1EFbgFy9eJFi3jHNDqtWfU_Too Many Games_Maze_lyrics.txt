4 ContributorsToo Many Games Lyrics
Lovers, they sometimes get
On each others nerves
They can really, really be so mean
Playing around with words
Wanna know why do we do it
Why we choose to break each other's hearts
Why when it keeps us far apart
Ain't it funny the things we do
For the sake of pride
It don't matter (Don't matter) who might get hurt
As long as you're satisfied
We ought to be right to each other
Ooh, you know the things I'm speaking of
Why do we mess around with love

Too many games that people play
Too many games that people play
Far too many games that people play (Sometimes)
Too many games that people play, woo

Hey, hey, hey, hey
(Alright, alright, tell 'em 'bout it, tell 'em 'bout it)
Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
You might also like
Too many people, they get hung up
On those he say she say games
We don't care (We don't care) who might get hurt
And you know that's just insane
We've got to stop, look, listen
At the way we treat each other so unkind
Why when it's just a waste of time

Too many games that people play (Why y'all?)
Too many games that people play
Far too many games that people play (Sometimes)
Too many games that people play (Ow)

You know what I'm talkin' 'bout
There can really be no doubt
I hope that you and I can work it out

Stop these silly games that people play
Too many games that people play
Too many games that people play
Too many games that people play
Stop playin', stop playin' with me
I'll stop playin' with you
Too many games that people play
Too many games that people playEmbed
