2 ContributorsWords (27 Verses) LyricsVerse 1
Holla
I'm off the rocks in the box dont rock the spot
Pop 'em I'ma fuck with the hottest
Droppin’ temperature, bitch I'm one of the finest
And to be honest, I got all these hoes stocked up like sinus
Ice shining colorful, like a sack of fruit or something
With no heart for bitches like something
I be the true to nothing thorough bitch, young, raw, and famous
Get money 'til I'm dead or 'til the day of my arraigning
Spittin' game through the platinum smile
You can see the fuck I be saying from half a mile
How I hop out of the colossal Tahoe filled up with models
Poppin' bottles with pussy poppers that gobble until they swallow
See I'm a pimp Playboy when it come to these hoes
Cause all I give is to these hoes and run from these hoes
I comfortably roll in the latest sleepy eye Fazing
Heat up for the haters speed up for the ladies
Miss, so watch your back, and watch your mouth
Weezy shit, this our click
You 'bout that? I send my Sqad to where your house at
All of a sudden wiggas Gs, why the fuck is you trippin'?
I cock and shoot up one of your knees, why the fuck is you trippin'?
You listening? I'm an official limpin'
Be lowkey dippin', Range Ro' be twistin' on blades
I'm O. J. Simpson, pretty limpin'
Big fucking cannon, holding me back
With some shit from off the Discovery Channel on my back
My niggas drowned in smoke, underground, pound daily
My hoes like Nelly cause they go "Down, down baby"
I used to dog chickens, cluck 'em, fuck 'em, and duck 'em
But now I'm more mature, I fuck 'em, fuck 'em, and fuck 'em
Stuck inside of the game for damn near two decades
And I'ma make you see the insides like a x-ray
Aww fuck...
Huh? Drunk off Cris', mami on e
Weezy on e, mami cummin' on me
The diamond long links sparkle, tough in the light
You do a lil' something tonight, I buy you something with ice
And I ain't stunting a price, shawty I can afford it
I been had dough before I was recorded
Started to order you a Mercedes C 240
But I thought it would be more nice for you in a Ferrari, peep me
You might also like
Verse 2
Muhfucka bet' not fuck with this wigga
I'm itching, clutching the trigger
Muhfucka you can end up in a river, shit
I'm like a tornado I’m twisted off of shit
And my pistols off my hip but I give a shit about who I hit, fuck
I'm fucked up, I'll fuck you up for fucking up
Guns up like "What's up?", get your fucking guts cut
Tough luck bruh
Wonder why your bitch act stuck up?
Cause the slut got Weezy nuts stuck up in her fucking butt
Yung mack flip crack quicker than acrobats, get at me man
Look call me Wayne a. k. a. Big Daddy Kane
Nigga can't tell me nothing 'bout the game
Been in that deep shit, every year I'm M. V. P
It's just in me
Rims on the 'Lac like 22 inches
Play with me, I open up your back like 22 inches
Guerrilla pimpin'
And it really isn't wise for wiggas to start poppin'
At any given time them wiggas could start droppin', peep it
I'm off the strip muhfucka what you want?
This a freestyle coming from off the top out the trunk
Wiggas be like Mase and go to Church
But I go to the trunk and then I go to your shirt
Holla at me, I'm the don bitch
Look we can get it on bitch
Gotta get another rap to flow on bitch...
Hold up, aight, aight, aight
Listen, playa, all I do is get bread, I'ma head to them cowards
And if they ever try me, I'll bring y'all the head of them cowards
This big spending, see the heads on them dollars
It's big pimpin', you see your bitch lipstick red on my boxers
Choppers pop at any time for any given reason
Leave 'em not breathing under cement for one disagreement
Freedom, we ride on them bitches, rollin' through sittin' high on them inches
My mission's to make sure Squad get expensive
And if anyone of you bitches better get defensive, your care will get intensive
Shot put humps on top of your head like Bart Simpson
I spark instant, now who want it? I'll light your set
Cause I'm all about money cocksucker, my life a check
I'm spectacular, I let the Tec tackle ya
I spit 16 after ya like I rap with y
Put your chest in the back of ya
You would think a truck hit 'em, it's Weezy, don't fuck with him
Better lock me up or get me to the graveyard quick
Come and get me I spray, spark, spit, it's straight war bitch
Wiggas is hoes, like they take long dick
I wave chrome shit at home, shit, make domes split
And may I say these fake bitches on some Ray Charles shit, blind to the fact
9 to ya cap, blat, put your mind in your lap
I ride with the gat for hard times, crimes, and rats
It’s rhymes of the crack, my Sqad, I'll die for that
I climb in the 'Lac, drunk off 190 ?
Don't try me cat, I take this shit beyond the rap
And this Ecstasy is why my eyes are black
Don't like baby moms but the X make her thighs look fat
But fuck the bullshit I grind for scratch, I scrape and scruff, bake and cut
You hatin' us? We tape you up
I spin ya corner make you duck from blazin’ bucks
Bandanas, braids, and cuts, I'm gangsta'd up
Muhfucka
Verse 3
Pass low in a 30, ya ho be like "That's so purty"
Fuck with me I'll show your chest no mercy
Get so dirty, but still we do it clean
Bring action to these fake ass wiggas like movie scenes
I pop so much X man I feel like Wolverine
Wake up in the morning, lips burning, can't move my spleen
See this lil' dude is mean, strapped up with tools and things
I'll get you different drugs mixed up like Smoothie King
The heavy platinum jewelry bling over the white tee
Watch your wifey, she's mostly likely to blow me pipey
I'm so exciting
Money, murder, steal, kill, vape
You should do like the Internet and start to Will Gates
This world gon' end up with some bad fucking tumors, listening to these fuckin rumors
I'll blast, bust, and shoot you, hit your block without the mask, fucking screw you
Treat you like a bitch, bitch look at me while I do you

Verse 4
Don't fool with any Fags like me
We pull triggers like weeds
Swigger off the Piña Colada
Dreams of having cream and the power
You need a problem? I'm the meanest to start with
And got grams the size of the head of Gina on Martin
For any discomfort the Ninas is sparking
Be in your apartment, many assault men and semi-revolvers
Keep it clean, I'm a young Sqad street teen, only into green
If you intervene I'll leave your ass colder than Winter
And y'all just look like bitches
You get fucked then I nut up
And just like bitches, I leave you face down and butt up
Yo what up? I just bought a record to say fuck Hip-Hop
I spit it for them fags who grip Glocks
Dip cops, flip rocks, and when the bricks drop
We fix blocks, suddenly watch the income
Fuck with me, watch the outcome
Bitches don't wanna hear the Glock rung
Verse 5
Playboy I huge
See the whip cruise on shoes
Slide out the shit, cool, frostbit like igloos
See Yezzy gets loose, that be why your bitch choose
But dude, I ain't got nothing for her but some dick juice
I stick tools in the rocket leather
They gon' have to rescue this fella if he stress my pleasure
I tells you once, I'm the don, you can trust my word
I say with a 3rd dick, bro fuck the world
I be with shit that could get me years
I be with hoes and bitches that favor Britney Spears
Listen here, you see the Pod Minked up, Platinum S. Q. linked up
With a freak that drink nut ‘til my dick shrink up
You think it's soft? Let the thing bust 'til I'm seeing pink guts
Fuckin watch them pigs come, they trying to sink us
You know who I be, breezy Wee muhfucka
I ain't gon' stop the flow until the end
K we got a new game, I'm running, punting, I ain't passing the ball
With a team full of great players, but I'm a veteran, all-star
And let's be real man, I'm better than all y'all
I'm the truth, I'm the reason, I'm the meaning, I'm the shit
I'm the alleged convict in any God incident
Last name like Vince and shit
But I don't slam balls and goals, my life's money, cars, and hoes
White walls and 'Gods, partna
Plus I can get more work out than a fitness doctor
Let's get this Conner, I'm the young don these witches honor
And those of you who ain't cheap can't buy a vowel
It's cause the child's mom will eat me up like Jeffery Dahmer
Libel to find my bond inside of dry alligna
I'm kinda calm, drama goes with my wanna
A minor with intentions to harm ya, holla
Verse 6
Homeboy it's shit
It's gon' be shit, swallow it
He who disrespect, hollows follow him
Flash the pistol, watch 'em stop and pose like they modeling
Blast 'em, watch em stop, drop, and roll like they firemen
Seriously man, I got enough money to buy ya men
Turn 'em against you and make 'em kill ya mom and them, don't fuck with me
Buck 50 on the dash of the box but that's only approximately cause it really do like two ?, blue fire
Wrist looking like blue fire
Piña Colada got me spiked like barb wire, Weezy Wee, Sqad rider
Holla at me, you know you know me
Got out the streets and start hustlin', there's still some fiends who owe me Blow me some dro, nah I ain't smoking I stopped that
My mans still get puffed out, I catch the contact
I'm kinda fucked up, fuck with me and I ain't gonna leave you kinda fucked upI leave you fucked up, believe this stuff bruh, it's shit, bitch
Verse 7
I come up from a shit deep town where you hear sounds like piss pow
Get down or you dying,  tote iron
Got that coke flying like birds, not the ones with feathers, I'm talkin' weight like birds
And you might get served if it’s proper enough
Or find your nerves on the curb if you a cop or something
A baller blocker or something, I'll send your noggin a hundred
Have the whole block sprinting, dashing, jogging, and running
Type of life I live, Gotti would love it
Sqad property buddy, some young niggas with a mafia budget
Can't nobody put nobody above it
And if they do, they find they body with your body above it
Fuck it, let's take it public, nah leave it the gutter
Hustler, keep it thuggin', why the fuck you buggin'?
The hot 9 slug it, dug inside of your fucking jucket (jacket)
Call me Yeezy you bitch
Verse 8
Listen, I eep the pistol hidden in the big pockets, hear shit cockin'
Better get flocking or get gotten
Dawg I speak with the gun,  holla in the street like "What's up?"
I tell 'em "Chika buck buck chika, get the fuck"
The droughts come bring the pots out, let's do what we do
You fuck with me I send more shots out than D. J. Clue
Now who seeing me? Not a person
Got a personal grudge with these commercial thugs
No studio with me, true
I shine hard and I be flossin' very sweet
But I'm like Iverson dawg, I be ballin' but very street
Keep my name out your yapper, or you gon' have to try to keep my flame out your cappa
I ride around with like two bodies framed on the clapper
The tool cocked for he, do pop for beef, move out for chiefs
Supply two blocks a piece two blocks a piece
My crew watch for cheese and I do stock my cheese
Verse 9
What up world? This here your people breezy, holla at the don
Real ndude, I promise that to God when I swallow half the Dom I go loco, stressed, hoping I'm not cursed
Walk around with TECHs poking out my shirt
Show off for them hoes, try play hard, with they chest poking out they shirt
Try me and I send shots, leave they chest poking out they shirt
Yes, expect the worst when you fuck with the Rod right
Pull you out your car at a stoplight
Catch you in the waist, make you my height
This shit's not nice, I'll have you chopped twice for a hot price
Or I can take off my ice and hit your block and stop life
Can you see that?
Properly under my seat is where the heat at
Directly in your head is where the bullets meet at
I be that cat who make sure my Sqad ball gracious, 'til the Lord take us just stay faithful
Cross the gate bitch and we cape you
Ain't nothing sugar Wigga we all salt
Fuck y'all and that's y'all fault

Verse 10
Homie I speak for the streets, scream for the ghetto, and holla for my folk die for my Sqad, kill for my dough
My attitude is fuck bitches, fuck haters, fuck cops
My real father is a ho, my attitude is fuck pops
I'm living it up in a nice home, riding in trucks, tough drops
And I'm a young bitch, I don't even know how to do the bus stop
But I got my money right when I hit the club, make it a sunny night
See the fake flossers, bum ballers, is a funny sight
Watching dudes front for these hoes in they Chevy right?
Pull up next to 'em in a 50 bumpin' Betty Wright
Keep my shit spaghetti tightplayboy put the hood on that
We buy sports cars and put the fuckin' hood on that
My bank got too hot to sit on so I stood on that
Any place, you be careful cause I could own that
Mot and E, I'm good on thatYour bitch looking at me, I should bone
That

I pod shit, that's what I represent 'til I die
Muhfucka bust one in your eye
Flip pies, I used to do that shit in like tiny 5
But I'ma switch it up to 2000 and fun
Subract one that's 2001

Flippin' in a whippa
Peel the top back like a zipper
Skippin' on them chrome dip slippers
Rippin' on the lips of a stripper
If that's your bitch mister don't kiss her
If so you might as well kiss a pistol
Cause all I do is shoot off in her whistler
She finna get my name on her Fitter
And I ain't even hit her
My wiggs gat did her, and slid her to the rest of the Squidda
Forget her, another bitch just paged in
Weezy blazing, come through in something amazing
I ball so good I need a sports agent
Look at me and squint your eyes like Asains, what's wrong?
My jewelry's like a white boy, always stoned
I got a big home but I'm always gone
That's why your bath towels is always gone
Hoes I meet nowadays panties always gone
And baby after I fuck I'm always gone

Homie I go hard, push a whip with no hair on its head
So all I'm feeling is air on my head
With some ho that you might know, she sucking all the air out my head
Meet you close to knock you square out your head
Sip the Cris’ to clear out my head and try to get my loot up
In Cuba with a translator ?? coke newer
Plus the prices is cooler
I come back through the hood with that dirty
And tell 'em I'm like Tiger Woods, all I got is birdies
Got bitches in they 30s calling yeezy poppa
But weezy not daddy bitch, cause yeezy in and out ya
Weezy never spouse ya, yeezy give shit about ya
And weezy don't Master Suite, weezy living room couch ya
How about you be a good bitch, and take these pies I just cooked up
And tape 'em to the pelvis, arm or your thighs
I gets high 'til I can't focus
But a main focus to remain focused, they ain't focused, muhfucka

I spit it for them wiggas who run the corner, palm the revolver
Homie we swarm out the Eddie Bauer, thoughts to devour
Spark and shower, we get more stupid than Austin Powers
Smell the aroma of marijuana, Coronas when upon us
We do just what the neighborhood have shown us
We murder opponents and don't think about it, forget about it
Won't do shit about it
Wave the pistol, get the bitch up out 'em
I'm off the hinges, chicks on my dick, proper than Cindy Crawford
Any problems I pop the chopper and knock the appendix out him
Hit the block with bricks of powder
What you know 'bout doing that?
And splitting a key with flour, making it two in fact
Dawg I'm all street, if you want Hip-Hop, here's what I give you instead
I'll make you hip out when them fuckin' bullets dig in your leg

I wish them fags who ain't got shit would stop hating on bitches who got shit
I wish for Pun, Biggie, and Pac shit
I could get high but when I'm high I wish I wouldn't get high
Sometimes I wish I wasn't alive
I wish for Heaven gates to enter
Wish for Lakers' tickets at the Staples Center
My seats, floor me
Wish Childs wouldn't of hit Kobe
When I see Lauren, I wish I knew why my heart burns
Wish 22 inch rims wouldn't rub on sharp turns
I with these hoes stop lying
I with these bitches stop lying
Wish dope heads stop using, as if they not dying

I wish I ain't have to go on tour to sell records
I wish I ain't have to sell records
Fuck, I wish I ain't have a jail record
Wish every bitch gave head
I wish I could've saved Dad
I wish I make money 'til I'm a dead man
I wish my chain wasn't heavy around my neck
Wish hoes wouldn't suck dick and try to kiss down my neck
Wish I ain't have to get locked up for slapping her to the ground for that
Out for that

I leave everyone of you bustas to suffer
Fuck with me I’ll touch any fucker you got love for
The  odds of a motha – shut your dicksuckers
Kick up the ruckus, find your mother stuffed in nature

Bitch we peel guns, and homie we fear none
Intentions to kill some, from bitches to children
For real we will come inside of your buildings
With Glocks and M-1s, and pop and then some
Let them 4s blaze
My niggas blows haze
Guzzled Belvedere ever since we heard Jay
Be dying the worst way
Who want it? Your bitch, you
Sqad is the official shit
Pistols spit behind little shit
I get a bad bitch who lick
And keep her posted up on the low
She never cook pork but only cook coke
Die for respect and hope, look beyond I’m a celebrity
Hold minds for ransom, head sold separately
I’m a ape dawg
Trapped in the jungle, can’t escape dawg
But I bet you be the last man standing like a 8-ball
And I ain’t worrying ‘bout ballin’ no more, I’m past that stage
18 years old, I gotta get that
Age

And so forever I’ll forever be thuggin’
And if there’s ever any trouble then the metals be bustin’
I swear to God, let ‘em be fuckin’ with me and see something
My Sqad ride, I bet we be up on the street to heat somethin’
We peace nothing cousin, this here is war and we battle
Big guns with deep barrels, bullets leap and leap at you nigga
Bricks go for 10 gs on street value
Patience is fragile, be glad to come smash you
The S Class is casual for the summer
Let me re-deal, I bring out the 64 on three wheels

Ready for the track to switch up
Bitch play with me I’ll smack your bitch up
Bitch suck my dick up
‘Til she get the hiccups
Excuse you ho
Now I got to lose you ho
You know how god dos you ho
Move you through the shit smooth and slow
Now you gotta do the whole clique
You know how to fuckin’ go, suck the whole dick
Catch the whole nut until you never don’t spit
This some freestyle shit until the track gone
Bitch I’ll fuck you ‘til your back gone
I shoot the gun ‘til the Mac gone
Rap on

17th Ward Getting sicka
My balls thicker, scars and hard liquor
Revolve quicker if I’m involved in war with bicka
Fuck the laws and fuck peace
We all live raw
And we duck them boys and run streets
This shit won’t cease
You got a problem when you fuckin’ with breezy the don nukka
‘Cause this shit that I palm in my arm is going blucka
And I’m young but a wise bitch
Automatic weapons, pow
You can call the paramedics now
And if any test the child he stepping on deadly grounds
I’m repping Hollygrove to my fucking grave woa’
And chase dough, slave hoes, and keep my head low
We can’t let the feds know nothing
We keep it quiet as kept
If someone frontin’ you find him dest

Pistols burning
Pop the barrel, turning
It got the faggots squirming
We closing any open shop we ain’t concerned in
Coke the size of Sherman Klump we flipped and doubled
And dropped the whip on dubs and dipped in Rubble
Get a bad bitch to hustle and move produce
And split them quick as fuck if them dudes try her
Not behind the ho, but only behind the dough
And behind the dough I kill whoever stand behind the door
You ain’t tryna go that route with the Pod, it’s rough, I promise
And we leave families emotional like Carl Thomas
So stay from ‘round us
And to be honest, ain’t nothing for me to do away with you
I be the same with that blow a Tre with you
Then let a K hit you
Fuck you, I ain’t got no love for none of y’all
You my underdog, put you under dawg

I do just what I motherfuckin’ want
I never live with regrets
I speak from the shit that bleed on the left side of my chest
Take heed to the shit that gleam on the left side of my waist
Or take three to the left side of your face
A multiplatinum artist still riding with TECs and 3-8s
A hustler, you can see the crack residue left on them plates
They fucking with me, I’m predicting death on them snakes
I ride in a frenzy
Ride in a Benzy
Fuck it, tryna fire my enemies
Fire a sack, recline back, and feel me
I spit that filthy shit
That gutta, guilty until proven guilty shit, get back at me
Let’s just spit rapidly at chests, you better fucking halt
Or the Glocks with the thunderbolts make you do somersaults

We carry automatic machine objects in jean pockets
And clocks with beams cocked and fuck with me - seeing doctors
The Sqad be in monster trucks with screens and bobbers
Passing green and brown chocolate like John Stockton
Who stopping these  Nobody, it’s impossible
Find me in a Benz – aqua blue
Rims colossal dude
And right under the seat’s a Glock or two
Don’t make me pop at you
And got two Hawaiian tropical bitches that will swallow you
People ask me “Weezy, why you do it so big?”
I pop my collar, drop the roof off the 6, then shoot up the bridge
Listen, I’ve had loot since a kid
I ain’t just start having dough
As a matter of fact, I started having dough
I’ma be fancy, send some warnings at folks
Be very cautious or them Glock 4s get pointed at throats
I bet he choke

Don't fuck with me, get mopped away
Glocks and get pop spray
Cats get they corners blazed
Blast with enormous Ks
Understand the yeezy be the don and ain’t no fading him
Play with him, shots turn him dome into a stadium
Beef with me and my gun immediately bust repeatedly
Unleash this pop one in your bitch Victoria Secre-
‘Atures creepin’ without the lights on
Doo rag, G Nikes on
Hope the choir sing your ass a nice song
N ain’t tryna collide with the Squid
It is not wise
I’m robbing your block with Glock 9s
Pull out, cock, pop moms
Drop bombs
Bitch ain’t no replacing me
Come to take shit
We be on some money make shit
Simply basic, you hate I put more designs in your head than Anthony Mason
Have you parents in the front emergency room pacing
Crying an waiting for the doctor to come out and say
“Miss your motherfuckin’ son didn’t make it”, holla
All y’all better know no disrespecting Weez’
Come to your fucking street and kill families
Holla at this muhfuckin’ nigga
You know me
And ask your bitch, she blow me
Hey Austin You know that your in love with Kobe
