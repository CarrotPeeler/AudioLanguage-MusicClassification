12 ContributorsThe Fire Down Below Lyrics
I'm stuck between the voice
Stuck between the voice
And the echo
I'm stuck between the voice
Stuck between the voice
And the echo
Stuck between the voice
Stuck between the voice
And the echo
Stuck between the voice
Stuck between the voice
And the echo, and the echo and the echo

It's time to let my mind go
And I'm willing to fade away with you
If this is how I'm saved, then let it be
God stopped listening 'cause the wolf kept crying
God stopped listening 'cause the wolf kept crying

Take the air from my lungs
Put it in her's because she's the one who deserves to live
The one that I pray that god forgives
Pray that god forgives, pray that god, pray that god
She's the one who deserves to live
The one he forgives
You might also like
Can't stop who I've become
My love will never be sung
It's the pain before pleasure
Now speak for the glory of one
Open your eyes, open your eyes
You deserve better, now give it your all

Take the air from my lungs
Put it in her's because she's the one who deserves to live
The one that I pray that god forgives
Pray that god forgives
Pray that god, pray that god, pray that god forgives
She's the one who deserves to live
The one that he forgives

Why can't my words keep us afloat?
Why can't my words keep us afloat?
And if we drown, let me make it for you
If we drown, let me make it for you
I never knew love until you
I never felt love until you
So why'd I throw it all away?
Why's it coming unglued?
Why's it coming unglued?
Change me for all the times
You hated my crimes, you hated my crimes
Watch the world burn in her eyes
If we're destined to be damned
If we're destined to be damned
Stuck between the voice and the echo2Embed
