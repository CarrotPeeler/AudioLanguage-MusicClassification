4 ContributorsMidnight Sun LyricsThank you ever so kindly, I'm here with my machine
Don't you see
Flash lights ten things enlightening the midnight sun
It's washed away
When the sea is repeating the same move over again
It's time to wake
When the sea is still asleep lot of fire in the sky
Over and over and over again
I feel the rhythm inside of my head
Endlessly repeating the same tune over again
(Over again, over again, over again, over again)
Walk away with me
We're prisoners of the gravity but we can still be free
In the silence of the empty streets
I'm walking in the midnight sun, walking in the midnight sun
