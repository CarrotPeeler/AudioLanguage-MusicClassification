4 ContributorsMary Without Sound Lyrics
Mary-go-round
I'd like to see you when the summer sun sets down
Straight from the pages into memories that hang around
I can't believe that there is nowhere you can go and not be found without sound

From the pages of the morning when you mentioned you're worthless to me

Hand over hand, the pages turn
The pages without sound
Turn on empty hands
Tonight will end
Without sound

Mary-go-round
Hold back the hand-me-downs and bring back the bright sound
Head for the razor broken bottle hangman run-arounds
Time for the message to return with the sender unsigned and without sound

From the pages of the morning when you mentioned you're worth less to me

It's a battle you can't win
It's a battle you'll lose
It's a battle you can't win
It's a battle you'll lose
It's a battle you can't win (It's late tonight, the stars have gone)
It's a battle you'll lose (Without a sound, you're not around)
It's a battle you can't win (It's late tonight, the stars have gone)
It's a battle you'll lose (Without a sound, you're not around)
You might also like
Hand over hand, the pages turn
The pages without sound
Turn on empty hands
Tonight will end
Without sound

Mary-go-round
I'd like to see you when the summer sun sets downEmbed
