Will we all just fade away
And will the sun explode
Destroying everything
Tomorrow
Will we all just fade away
And will the sun explode
Destroying everything
We are lines too little
Fading fast away
Too little we all shine
We will find a way
We are lines, we are lines
Fading fast away, fading fast away
What happens
Will we all just fade away
And will the sun explode
Destroying everything
What happens
Will we all just fade away
And will the sun explode
Destroying everythingYou might also likeEmbed
