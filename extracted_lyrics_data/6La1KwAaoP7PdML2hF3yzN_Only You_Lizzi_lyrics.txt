1 ContributorOnly You LyricsDown below
You grow like sea time
Floating past the window of my mind
Sweeping silence in a world so fine
Form nowhere to nowhere
Till the end of time
Outside me and my reality
I float away
I float away
You know
From dusk to dawn
I stay with you
Only you
Only you
This is true
Its only you
Only you
Only you
This is true
Its only you
Tight as tight
Could hope to be
Tender times stroke you to sleep
Safe and sound
In our keep
I drift away
You know
From dusk to dawn I stay with you
Only you
Only you
This is true
Its only you
Only you only you
This is true its only you
You
You
You might also likeSlowly I know it
Will bring me my time
Only you
Only you
This is true
Its only you
Only you
Only you
This is true
Its only you
La da la dum
La da la dum
La da la dum
La da la dum
La da la dum
La da la dum
La da la dum
Only youEmbed
