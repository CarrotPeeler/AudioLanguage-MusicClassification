2 ContributorsPony Lyrics
Are you ready, are you ready to play the game
Are you ready are you ready to play the game
Are you ready, ah ah, are you ready to play the game
Are you ready, ah ah, are you ready to play the game
It is like riding a pony
Whenever we get horny
He hisses like a horsy
We get busy
It is like riding a pony
Whenever we get horny
He hisses like a horsy
We get busy
You child get back in this room
So we may play
So we may do
You child get back in this room
So we may play fat kaboom
You child get back in this room
So we may play
So we may do
You child get back in this room
So we may play fat kaboom

I've heard of a leg of lamb...
A leg of chicken, but never a leg of potato

Ah ah
Are you ready, are you ready to play the game
Are you ready, are you ready to play the game
Are you ready, ah ah, are you ready to play the game
Are you ready, ah ah, are you ready to play the game

Cussing and turfing and riding for more, right men
Dem chubby chicks chinese lips tiny wits don't know shit about flying
And when they bring you below keep it indoor tell me how bad your body got sore
I ain't going back in that room boy, I've no interest in kaboom boy

Are you ready to play the game (Ah ah, ah ah)
Are you ready to play the game (Ah ah, ah ah)
Are you ready to play the gameEmbed
