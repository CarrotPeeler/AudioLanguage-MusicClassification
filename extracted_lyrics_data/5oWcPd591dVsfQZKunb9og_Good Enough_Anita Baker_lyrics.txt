3 ContributorsGood Enough Lyrics
Now you can count on for anything you choose
Say but the best that I can offer is love true
Still I know you wonder why
This love of mine seems to die
As if I live in the clouds and you live in the sea
Now you can bet your bottom dollar that I love you
Now for a basic fact like that, you'll need no clue
I just hope you think I'm good enough
I hope you think I'm girl enough
I hope you believe in chemistry for two
I really do, I, I do
My, my baby, I'm telling you, honey...

For your love, baby
Said I would walk through fire
For your love, honey
Said I would reach my highest ground
For this love, baby
There ain't nothing that could turn me around
And I'll never let you down
For your love, baby
I'd take a walk through fire
For your love, honey
Said I would reach my highest ground
For your love, baby
There ain't nothing that could turn me
I'd die for your love, lie for your love
I'd even touch the sky, for your love
You might also like
Baby, bet your bottom dollar that I'm gonna love you
Said for a basic fact like that, you'll need no clue
I hope you think I'm good enough
I hope you think I'm girl enough
I hope you believe in chemistry for two
I tell you, I hope you think I'm girl enough
I hope you think I'm good enough
I hope you believe in chemistry for two
I really do...

(Scatting & ad-libs)
I do
I'd never lie to you, baby...mhm
Don't lie, ain't no lie, I...love you...
Spread my wings and fly to you, baby
Yes, I'd lie; yes, I would
I'd lie for you, babyEmbed
