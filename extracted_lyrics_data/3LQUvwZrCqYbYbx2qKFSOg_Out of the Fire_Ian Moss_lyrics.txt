1 ContributorOut of the Fire LyricsAnd we go out of the fire
And into the night
Burning for love
To make it alright
Heartache In the morning light
I can see, looking back
Tell me now, do you feel alright?
Are you lonely on the track?
How many times, did you tell me to stop (Tell me to stop)
Or you'll burn out, much too fast
And how many miles, do you run on the spot
'Till you say, this step is the last
And we go out of the fire and into the night (Into the night)
Looking for love, trying to make it right
Out of the fire, and into the night (Into the night)
Burning for love, trying to make it right
Party time, and the music's hot
I can lose it, play the game
But sometimes there'll be a stranger talk
And I'll hear him say your name
That's how it goes, I'm happy to know
You've got friends, to help you through
But I wonder, later, alone in my room
If you get misty too
You might also likeAnd we go out of the fire and into the night (Into the night)
Looking for love, trying to make it right
Out of the fire, and into the night (Into the night)
Burning for love, trying to make it right
Day after day just getting to work on time
Brings plenty to do, to keep my peace of mind
Well you know

How many times have I reached to call
And dialled somebody new?
When under it all, I'd be happy to fall
For someone just like you
And we go out of the fire and into the night (Into the night)
Looking for love, trying to make it right
Out of the fire, and into the night (Into the night)
Burning for love, trying to make it right
Out of the fire, and into the night (Into the night)
Looking for love, trying to make it right
Out of the fire, and into the night
Burning for love
Out of the fire
Looking for love
Out of the fire
Looking for loveEmbed
