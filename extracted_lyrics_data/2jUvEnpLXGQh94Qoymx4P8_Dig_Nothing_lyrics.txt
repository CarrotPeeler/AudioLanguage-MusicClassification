10 ContributorsDig LyricsYou can throw a sheet gently over me
I can make believe I’m a ghost
Lay here and pretend the rain on the roof
Is dirt pouring on my casket
Scratched your name into me
So I can not forget
Dug a hole inside me
Stayed till the end
You can throw a sheet gently over me
I can make believe I’m a ghost
I will not pretend I am happy
You are finally happy
Scratched your name into me
So I can not forget
Dug a hole inside me
Stayed till the end
Scratched your name into me
So I can not forget
Dug a hole inside me
Stayed till the endYou might also like1Embed
