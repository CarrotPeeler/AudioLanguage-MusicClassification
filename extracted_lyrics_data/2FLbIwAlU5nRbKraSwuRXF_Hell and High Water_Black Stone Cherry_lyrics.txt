1 ContributorHell And High Water (Acoustic) LyricsI know your hiding places
I know your every move
Cus' girl I've been lonely too
I've seen a million faces
Been to a million places
But girl there's no one quite like you
And I'd walk through hell and high-water
Wash away with the tide
I could lose a damn war all by myself
If you were on the other side
So in the morning when the rooster crows
Pack your bags and get ready to go
If you're walking through hell and high-water
Please don't do it alone
I know you feel let down
I know you've been turned out
I wish I'd been there for you
When the night-time comes around
And you feel like an unlit town
Just know I'll be there for you
And I'd walk through hell and high-water
Wash away with the tide
I could lose a damn war all by myself
If you were on the other side
So in the morning when the rooster crows
Pack your bags and get ready to go
If you're walking through hell and high-water
Please don't do it aloneYou might also likeEmbed
