1 ContributorI Don’t Know Why LyricsI don’t know why, I don’t know, I don’t know why I love you
I don’t know why I ever let you go
I guess it made sense to me years ago
But now I am living alone
Still chasing home
Like I was 22
But I’m without you
Chorus:
I don’t know why, I don’t know, I don’t know why, why I love you
But I do
I don’t know why, I don’t know, I don’t know why, why I want you
The way that I do
It’s been a long time and I am doing all right
I have a new life
But the memories are from the other one I had with you
Why do I do, the things that I do?
(Chorus)
Why did I let you go?
I don’t know why, I don’t know, I don’t know why, why I love you
It’s true
I don’t know why, I don’t know, I don’t know why, why I want you
But you know that that I do
I don’t know why, I don’t know, I don’t know why, why I still need you
But you know that that I do
I don’t know why, I don’t know, I don’t know why, but I love you.﻿You might also likeEmbed
