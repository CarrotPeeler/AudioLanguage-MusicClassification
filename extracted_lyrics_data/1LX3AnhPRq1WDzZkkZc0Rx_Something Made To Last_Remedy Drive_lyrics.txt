1 ContributorSomething Made to Last LyricsEverything's so artificial
A fabrication of what's beautiful
I won't be satisfied in my plastic paradise
Give me something made to last
I'm fading fast
Something to hope in
'Cause everything is broken down here
Something made to last
Something made to last
Rock and roll - happiness - diamond rings
These are the best of the temporary things
There must be more for us
'Cause it's all turning into dust
Bridge:
A kingdoms coming
And it won't stop running
It won't fade awayYou might also likeEmbed
