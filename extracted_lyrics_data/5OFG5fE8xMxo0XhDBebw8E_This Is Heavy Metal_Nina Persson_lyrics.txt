2 ContributorsThis Is Heavy Metal Lyrics
I would like to sell now
My life is going well now
My bones are at an all time ok

Home is not a building
It's valued at a billion years old
It doesn't care that I'm here

Ivy left a son
Who'll stay on after I'm gone
He'll be unbreakable by design

Still a little shaken
From pieces that were taken
I wonder if they ever were mine

Mine
Mine

Gold is overrated
It's dead, it can be traded or sold
It's got nothing on time
You might also like
This is heavy metal
The dust is going to settle
The sun will find it's way down the mine

Mine
MineEmbed
