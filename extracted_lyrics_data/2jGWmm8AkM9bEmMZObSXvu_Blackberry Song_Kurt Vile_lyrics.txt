4 ContributorsBlackberry Song Lyrics
Man, I like your style
Make it last a little while
Put yourself under the ground
And you come back around
I want to see you
Still the same

Girl, you're like a child
Your blackberries grow so wild
Pick the best ones off the bush
You relish and wish you were alright
Left with lace
With rightness

My beloved blackberry
My love for you floats free
Leave yourself in sound
Turn around
Sing me your blackberry songYou might also likeEmbed
