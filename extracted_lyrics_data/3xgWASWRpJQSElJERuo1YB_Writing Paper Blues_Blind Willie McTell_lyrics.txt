1 ContributorWriting Paper Blues LyricsI wrote you a letter, mama
Put it in your front yard
I wrote you a letter
Put it in your front yard
I would love to come to see you
But your good man's got me barred
You wrote me a letter
To come back the Newport noon
You wrote me a letter, mama
Come back the Newport noon
To leave the town
And don't spread the news
I wrote you a letter, mama
Sent you a telegram
I wrote you a letter, mama
Sent you a telegram
Not to meet me in Memphis
But meet me in Birmingham
Um, hear me weep and moan
Um, hear me weep and moan
Honey, hear my pleading
Hear me grieve and groan
You might also likeAh, if I could get me
One more drink of booze
If I could get me
One more drink of booze
I guess it would ease these ol' writin' paper blues
I caught a freight train special
My mama caught a passenger behind
Caught a freight train special
My mama caught a passenger behind
Said, "You can't quit me, papa
There ain't no need in tryin'"Embed
