3 ContributorsOnly You Lyrics
When the night is young
But it makes you feel much older
And you're comatose
Each waking hour of life
When the days go by
But the darkness lingers longer
And before you know it
Life is one long night

But when I close my eyes
I see you stand before me
And if you take my hand
I'll leave it all behind

Because only you can set me free
So hold me close just like the first time

The flashing lights
Illuminate your halo
And my pounding heartbeat
Thunders like a drum
When we used to dance
We'd never cast a shadow
Cos there was only you and me
When we were young

But in this sea of scars
The first cut is the deepest
No matter where you are
I'll always think of you

Because only you can set me free
So hold me close just like the first time
And show me how it used to be
Because only you can set me free

Only you
Only you

Because only you can set me free
So hold me close just like the first time
And show me how it used to be
Because only you can set me freeEmbed
