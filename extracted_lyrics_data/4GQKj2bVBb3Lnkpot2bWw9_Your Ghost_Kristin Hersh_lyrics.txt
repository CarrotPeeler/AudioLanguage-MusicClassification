14 ContributorsYour Ghost Lyrics
If I walk down this hallway tonight, it's too quiet
So I pad through the dark and call you on the phone
Push your old numbers
And let your house ring till I wake your ghost
Let him walk down your hallway, it's not this quiet
Slide down your receiver, stand across the wire
Follow my number
Slide into my hand

It's the blaze across my nightgown
It's the phone's ring

I think last night you were driving circles around me
I think last night you were driving circles around me
I think last night you were driving circles around me
I think last night you were driving circles around me

I can't drink this coffee till I put you in my closet
Let him shoot me down, let him call me off
I take it from his whisper
You're not that tough
You might also like
It's the blaze across my nightgown
It's the phone's ring

You were in my dream (I think last night)
You were driving circles around me
You were in my dream (I think last night)
You were driving circles around me
You were in my dream (I think last night)
You were driving circles around me
You were in my dream (I think last night)
You were driving circles around me
You were in my dream (I think last night)
You were driving circles around me1Embed
