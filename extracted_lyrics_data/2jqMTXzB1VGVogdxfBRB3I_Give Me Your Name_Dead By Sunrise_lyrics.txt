15 ContributorsGive Me Your Name Lyrics
Give me a smile, give me your name, girl
Give me a sign to get my way
And get what I came for, you
'Cause you don't come easy

Give me your hand, come walk with me, girl
Nothing's that far when you're near
So come even closer to me
Something so easy to do

And I fall into the ocean (Into the ocean)
Inside of your arms, taking me deeper (Deeper)
Where all the pain goes

Give me a smile, give me your name, girl
Let them know that you're mine
And I'll do the same for you
'Cause our love comes easy

And I fall into the ocean (Into the ocean)
Inside of your arms, taking me deeper (Deeper)
Where all the pain goes
You might also like

And I fall into the ocean (Into the ocean)
Inside of your arms, taking me deeper (Deeper)
Where all the pain goes
With a smile into the ocean (Into the ocean)
Inside of your arms (Inside of your arms), taking me deeper (Taking me deeper)
Giving me new life

You're mine
You're mine2Embed
