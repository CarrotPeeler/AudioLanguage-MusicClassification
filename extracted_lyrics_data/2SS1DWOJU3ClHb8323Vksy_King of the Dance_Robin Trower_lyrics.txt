And the floor was my bed
The rhythm of the streets
Was my daily bread
It's a restless situation
And each day's a game of chance
'Cause when you dance in the streets
For a nickel or a dime
You learn how to move, babe
You learn how to shine
And if you shine like a star
They'll call you king of the dance
So come on, come on get up on the floor
Come on, come on dance me some more
Come on take a chance
Be the king of the dance
I'm gonna dance for the world
I ain't never gonna stop
It's a long way down
When you're looking from the top
And if you shine like a star
They'll call you king of the dance
