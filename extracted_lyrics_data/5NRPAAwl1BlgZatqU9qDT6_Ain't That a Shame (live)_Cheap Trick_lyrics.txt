2 ContributorsImage Isn’t Everything Lyrics
'Cause it goes on
On
Yeah, it goes on

Image isn’t everything, they selling us cheap tricks
Without no receipt 'cause they just like a thief is (Yeah)
And this is where the sheep live, treated like beatniks
Money's man-made so thank God for the free things (Yeah)
What do you believe in? Most people nothing
You could really say that, that’s a closed-off assumption
The whole globe has got faith but we don’t show it the same
Some hide behind money or get a boatload of fame
And then they soak up the pain by rolling notes for cocaine
'Cause life is like gambling, we got poker to play
And this is my life’s lane, I’m driving over the range
With full control of my brain, I went and opened the gates
Insecurities hurt, keep acting like a tough guy
Every girl's beautiful, that ego must die
(Yeah, yeah) 'Cause image isn’t everything
Understand that and feel better than we’ve ever been
But money's what they want you to be generous with
So they will tell you it is if they can sell you some shit
Now we got billion-dollar industries to welcome it with
They got the people by the balls with an incredible grip
I’m like whatever with this, just call it conditioning
Mind control techniques, it’s war that we’re living in
This goes to the teens with a low self-esteem (Uh)
Don’t let any motherfucker take your hopes, we are free

'Cause it goes on
On
Yeah, it goes on

Life’s ill, sometimes life might kill
It’s a bumpy road, gonna wear that tread on the wheels
It's a curse that half of what we feel isn’t real
Or a gift that half of what we feel isn’t real
Life’s ill, sometimes life might kill
It’s a bumpy road, gonna wear that tread on the wheels
It's a curse that half of what we feel isn’t real
Or a gift that half of what we feel isn’t real

Yeah
And none of us can predict the knocks life brings us
But some of us forget that we all got five fingers
Either the bullied just cop it from other kids in high school
Or else they go on to bully in a vicious cycle
Be your own person, screw what your friends say
Trust me, they’re as confused as you, yes, they
Stressing 'bout their virginity, tryna get laid
'Cause you ain’t cool if you haven’t lost it by tenth grade
Magazines telling teens what they must buy
Twelve-year-old girls insecure 'bout their cup size
What the fuck, right? Ain’t this a damn shame?
Kids begging parents for a tee with a brand name
Schoolyard politics, there’s a lot of it
Tough kids pushing you round like they’re problem less
This older kid wouldn’t let me off the bus at my stop
When he finally did, I cried, walking home nine blocks
And I can’t talk, man, I got my bully on
To make the cooler kids laugh, knowing it was fully wrong
And for my mistakes, when I started writing this
I didn’t see myself apologising on a mixtape
But I’m truly sorry, for any pain caused
When we see each other next, beers on me
And it’s honestly amazing that you took it
In doing so you’re already stronger than I could be
'Cause it goes on
On
Yeah, it goes on

Life’s ill, sometimes life might kill
It’s a bumpy road, gonna wear that tread on the wheels
It's a curse that half of what we feel isn’t real
Or a gift that half of what we feel isn’t real
Life’s ill, sometimes life might kill
It’s a bumpy road, gonna wear that tread on the wheels
It's a curse that half of what we feel isn’t real
Or a gift that half of what we feel isn’t real
