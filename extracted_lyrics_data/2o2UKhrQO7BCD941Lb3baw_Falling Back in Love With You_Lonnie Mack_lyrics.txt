While thinking 'bout the good old times
Guess I'm due for something new
I think I fall back in love with you
Lookin' up but feelin' down
Hanging 'round this same old town
Doing things like I used to do
Like falling back in love with you
'Cause you got the power to make me do
Anything you want me to
Power over me
When I'm falling back in love with you
It might be wrong but the feeling's right
And tomorrow we might even have a fight
But tonight what I'm gonna do
I think I fall back in love with you
'Cause you got the power to make me do
Anything you want me to
Power over me
When I'm falling back in love with you
Squeezing tight, kissing slow
Ray Charles on the stereo
Holdin' on but let it go
A falling back in love with you
You might also like'Cause you got the power to make me do
Anything you want me to
Power over me
When I'm falling back in love with you, yeah
Falling back in love with you, what you say
Falling, falling back in love with youEmbed
