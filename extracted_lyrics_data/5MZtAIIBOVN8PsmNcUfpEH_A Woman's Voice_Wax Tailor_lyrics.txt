1 ContributorA Womanâ€™s Voice Lyrics
We have some very interesting guests for us this evening...
Ok, ok, now a song for you...

Oooh...

It was a woman's voice
And it was such an anguished and heart-wrenching sound
I was totally arrested by its sadness
I closed my eyes for a few minutes
And that's when the dream must have come

Oooh...

"Then the disk on the stereo twanged off and out
And in the short silence before the next one came on
She suddenly came with a burst of singing"

Oooh...

"... Over in the old ... I was new over there, and so many people ... We had spent the morning in court, and hadn't even had time to get a bite to eat ..."

"You must go, go at once before Henry catches you here"
"Well see here, I thought you wanted to make the old boy jealous"
"Not anymore, he's threatened to kill you on sight!"
"Oh, I say, you don't think he would go that far, do you?"
"Of course he will! Oh, will you go before it's too late, before he shoots you to death!"Embed
