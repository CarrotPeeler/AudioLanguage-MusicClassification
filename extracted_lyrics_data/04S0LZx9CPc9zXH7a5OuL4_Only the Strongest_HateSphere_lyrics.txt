1 ContributorOnly The Strongest... LyricsFear is my tool
To keep you down
Hate is the way
To hold my crown
Reign of horror
I am on the top of the world
Trust me on this one
It all will die
Death is my business
Death make me what I am
I am locked and loaded
And I am ready to kill
Reign of horror
I am on the top of the world
From my domain
I watch it all go by
Across the blood red skyYou might also likeEmbed
