Oh, I said Georgia, Georgia yeah, a song of love
Comes as sweet and clear as moonlight through the pines
Other arms reach out to me, child 
Other eyes smile tenderly
Still in peaceful dreams I see
The road leads back to you
Oh, I said Georgia, oh oh Georgia yeah yeah, a song of love
Comes as sweet and clear as moonlight through the pines, oh my my
