3 ContributorsWhat We Can Never Have Lyrics
Locked inside the dark
I have a secret buried deep
I wish that I could tell you
It's forever mine to keep
Strangers on the sidelines
Tell me I'm the one deceived
Maybe they're alright
And maybe you're just my casualty

Now I believe in heaven
I believe in destined fate
And you should raise your hands
And pray to God it's not too late
Shadows fall around me
Everywhere that I have been
Maybe they're all wrong
Maybe you're just my only friend

But I'll always love what we had
And I'll always miss what we had
But we always love what we can never have

But I'll always love what we had
And I'll always miss what we had
But we always love what we can never have

And I'll always miss what we had
But we always love what we can never haveEmbed
