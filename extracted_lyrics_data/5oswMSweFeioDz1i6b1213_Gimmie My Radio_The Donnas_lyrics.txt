Chorus:
Gimmie my radio
Gimmie my radio
Gimmie my radio
Gimmie my radio
They took away my tv set
And my cheeba cigarette
I wanna be like Nikki Corvette, so
Chorus
I don't wanna eat these vegetables
I don't wanna read this book no more
I just wanna go to the rock 'n' roll show, so
Chorus
I'm a diva, yeah I know
Everybody tells me so
I don't wanna go to school no more, so
