Down on the muddy banks of the bayou
At Magdalen's moonlit cabaret
Captain Creole's in all his glory
Sipping whiskey and telling stories
Let's hear the one about the Devil's Queen

Welcome aboard the Devil's Queen
Rolling on the river all the way to New Orleans
Mr. Johnson and Sonny Boy are playing on and on and on
Beelzebub is dealing tour cards tonight
On the Devil's Queen

The midnight crow calls us up from the ground
The waters churn and the engines howl
All aboard that's going aboard

Welcome aboard the Devil's Queen
Rolling on the river all the way to New Orleans
Mr. Johnson and Sonny Boy are playing on and on and on
Beelzebub is dealing tour cards tonight
On the Devil's Queen
You might also like
All aboard that's going aboard

Welcome aboard the Devil's Queen
Rolling on the river all the way to New Orleans
Mr. Johnson and Sonny Boy are playing on and on and on
Beelzebub is dealing tour cards tonight
On the Devil's QueenEmbed
