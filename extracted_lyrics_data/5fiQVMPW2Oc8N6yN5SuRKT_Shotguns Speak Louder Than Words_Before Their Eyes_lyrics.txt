But somehow I know you're always here
Close to my heart
I can't believe your gone
It's not over
No we're not done
Let's show the world
Just what we've become
No, it's not over
No, we're not done
Let's show the world
Just what we've become
I won't forget what you told me
I know you're out there somewhere
Waiting for me any day
This time we won't cut corners
Well do our best to make it
Because we know it's the only way home
It's the only way home
It's not over
No we're not done
Let's show the world
Just what we've become
No, it's not over
No, we're not done
Let's show the world
Just what we've become

Don't let me go to waste
Pray for me, pray for me
It's not over
No we're not done
Let's show the world
Just what we've become
No, it's not over
No, we're not done
Let's show the world
Just what we've become
So please pray for me
Don't let me go to waste
Always close to my heart
I still can't believe you're gone
I still can't believe you're gone
I still can't believe you're gone
I still can't believe you're goneEmbed
