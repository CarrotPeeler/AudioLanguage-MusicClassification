2 ContributorsI Canâ€™t Get Next to You LyricsI can turn the gray sky blue, I can make it rain, when I want it too
I can build a castle for a single grain of sand; I can make a ship sail on dry land
Unhappy am I with all the power I possess, Honey you got the key to my happiness
And I...can't get next to you Babe, can't get next to you
I can fly, like a bird in the sky; I can buy anything that money can buy
I can turn a river, into a raging fire, I can live forever, if my soul desires
Unhappy am I with all the power I possess, you got the key to my happiness
And I...can't get next to you Babe, no I can't can't get next to you but I'm tryin
Get next to you ya never know how hard get next to you yeahYou might also likeEmbed
