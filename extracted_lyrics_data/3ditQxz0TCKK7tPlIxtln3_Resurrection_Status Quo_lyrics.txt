4 ContributorsResurrection LyricsSat by a river, wasting my time
I looked at the water and it gave me a sign
I made connection, my reflection
Was calling me back to rock and roll
It was moving, flowing along
I looked a little deeper and I thought of a song
And my reaction was satisfaction
Calling me back to rock and roll
Calling (calling) calling me back
I saw it in the water and I'm hitting the track
Nothing to pack, polish my act Lord
I'm gonna play some rock and roll
I was looking, looking ahead
Staying up instead of falling back into bed
Fuel injected, I've been elected
He's calling me back to rock and roll
Calling (calling) calling me back
I saw it in the water and I'm hitting the track
Nothing to pack, polish my act Lord
I'm gonna play some rock and roll

You might also likeIt must be something, something He said
That's changing my mind and adjusting my head
A new direction, a resurrection
Calling me back to rock and roll
Calling (calling) calling me back
I saw it in the water and I'm hitting the track
Nothing to pack, polish my act Lord
I'm gonna play some rock and roll
Calling me back, calling me back
