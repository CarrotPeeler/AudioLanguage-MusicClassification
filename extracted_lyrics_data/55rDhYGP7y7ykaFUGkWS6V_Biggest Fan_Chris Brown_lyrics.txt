17 ContributorsBiggest Fan Lyrics
You would think we in a waterbed
All the sheets are soaked
I'm glad that I ain't gotta work today
'Cause last night I did the most
Girl, you would think I was inside your head
'Cause I know everythin' you want
And no one asked you if you got a man
And do I care? I don't
That's when we started sexin'

It's gettin' loud (Loud)
Got 'em feelin' like they in the clouds (Clouds)
Got 'em screamin' like they in the crowd
I make them scream
Baby, baby, baby

When you scream
I need to pull your body closer, let me sex you, babe
Girl, you better not change your mind (Don't you change, girl, you're stayin')
'Cause, girl, we got one night only
And I want just to love right, baby
You're my biggest fan, girl, I want you to holler
See Chris Brown LiveGet tickets as low as $43You might also like
Oh-woah-oh-woah
(Yeah, damn)
Oh-woah-oh-woah
(I want you to holler)

Two girls, I'm watchin' (Hahaha)
No is not an option (No)
I'm gon' be the captain of the ship
They gon' have my boat a-rockin'
Singin' to them like Lionel Richie, all night long
Gettin' these bitches, they playin' my song
We switchin' positions and I got the money so I'm grantin' they wishes (Oh)
I'll be they sugar daddy

It's gettin' loud (It's gettin' loud)
Got 'em feelin' like they in the clouds (Clouds)
Got 'em screamin' like they in the crowd
I make them scream (Oh-woah)
When you

When you scream (Oh)
I need to pull your body closer, let me sex you, babe (Just let me sex you, girl)
Girl, you better not change your mind (Don't you change, don't you change, don't you change)
'Cause, girl, we got one night only
And I want just to love right, baby (Girl, you're my)
You're my biggest fan, girl, I want you to holler
For me, yeah, yeah, yeah
Come on, girl, tear it up
You can make it clap, for me, girl, give it up
Goddamn, you fine, I'm 'bout to stand up, stand up
I just came here just to make you holler
Doin' it for hours, even in the shower
Over and over again
Baby, I'm all up in your garden, kissin' flowers
Are you ready? I'ma take what's mine
And get comfortable
Slow and easy, I'm kinda tipsy off this wine
So what I say might be a little confusin'
I got a Magnum in my wallet, I'ma pull it out, I bet that I'll use it
I'm gon' make you scream

When you scream
I need to pull your body closer, let me sex you, babe (Oh-woah)
Girl, you better not change your mind (Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah)
'Cause, girl, we got one night only (Yeah)
And I want just to love right, baby (Love you right)
You're my biggest fan, girl, I want you to holler
When you scream
I need to pull your body closer, let me sex you, babe
Girl, you better not change your mind
'Cause, girl, we got one night only
And I want just to love right, baby
You're my biggest fan, girl, I want you to holler
