She threw it up an' drove away
So I made a call completely outta sight
Hope to put it right today
When Alice comes back to the farm
I won't be in the cold tonight
When Alice comes back to the farm
You know it's gonna be alright. yeah
Gimme an appointment put me in the light
That's a taste of what she needs
Such a disappointment daddy's in the right
Time for tearing out the weeds
When Alice comes back to the farm
I won't be in the cold tonight
When Alice comes back to the farm
You know it's gonna be alright, yeah
Relax now baby that woman won't get past my door
I believe, I believe that woman won't pass my door
She won't be raisin' no alarm
Don't get around much any moreYou might also likeEmbed
