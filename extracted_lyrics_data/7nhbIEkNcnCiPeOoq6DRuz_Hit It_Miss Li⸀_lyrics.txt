1 ContributorHit It LyricsThe air is thick and the place is packed
I'm going out to get a heart attack
The light flashes and the mind goes numb
My head beats like a drum
Please hand another rum and coke
Something, to moisterise my soul
Every night is a leaving home
It is sad to be alone
I go out every other night
Coming home with a broken heart
Hit it, hit it, hit it
Hit it to me harder
Bass drums and tambourines
Try to fix the make-up, but the mirror's mean
Out to nourish a salty dream
Hit it, hit it, hit it
Hit it to me harder
Walking home on a lonely street
High heels and aching feet
Is this supposed to be my golden years
Another day disappearsYou might also likeEmbed
