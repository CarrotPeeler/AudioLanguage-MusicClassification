With fear my only fuel
I found my faith
With nothing, nothing to do
Run from you
You're binding me in sin
You've got to
I drowned my left side
With lies I see as real
I push what doesn't move
I keep forgetting what is real
Run from you
You're binding me in sin
You've got to, run
I keep on running from you
Keep on fighting
Keep on fighting me, come on
Keep on fighting me, come on
Slipper (Whore! You fucking whore!)
Slipper (Whore! You fucking whore!)
Slipper (Whore! You fucking whore!)

You got it
You got it
You got it
You got it

Run from you
You're binding me in sin
You've got to, run
I keep on running from you
Keep on fighting
Keep on fighting me, come on
Keep on fighting me, come on
Slipper (Whore! You fucking whore!)
Slipper (Whore! You fucking whore)
