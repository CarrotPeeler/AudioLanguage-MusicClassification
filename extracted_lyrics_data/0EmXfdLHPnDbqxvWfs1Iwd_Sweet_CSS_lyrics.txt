3 ContributorsSweet Lyrics
You called me first thing in the morning
Your excitement could not be held or bared
Last night nothing really happened
But you wanted me to have been there, oh yeah
We do make mistakes, yes
We do make them
But we are young and fun
Soon we can laugh again

Oh oh, girls
Girls' world

We won't go to sleep at night
Wild flowers blooms in the dark
We won't go to sleep at night
Wild flowers blooms in the dark

I've seen you through your best and worst
And for you I always left an open door
We'll always going to have our sisterhood
Oh girl if you win,  I'm a winner too
We do make mistakes, yes
We do make them
But we are young and fun
Soon we can laugh again
You might also like
Oh oh, girls
Girls' world

We won't go to sleep at night
Wildflowers blooms in the dark
We won't go to sleep at night
Wild flowers blooms in the dark
We won't go to sleep at night
Wild flowers blooms in the dark
We won't go to sleep at night
Wild flowers blooms in the dark

We won't go to sleep
We won't go to sleep
We won't go to sleepEmbed
