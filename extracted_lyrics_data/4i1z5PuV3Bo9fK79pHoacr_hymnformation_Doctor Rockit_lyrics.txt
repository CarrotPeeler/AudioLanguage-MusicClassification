1 ContributorHymnformation LyricsI require more information
Don't want Murdoch informing me
Tilty tabloids spineless broadsheets
No more moral hypocrisy
I require better information
No more checkbook celebrities
Want to know why my tax money
Is spent on propping up industry
Losing touch with reality
We're selling anthrax to our enemies
Genome sites subsidized
And trivialized on tv
We require more information
Don't believe what you're telling us
Don't want Tory or New Labour
Had enough of corporate pusYou might also likeEmbed
