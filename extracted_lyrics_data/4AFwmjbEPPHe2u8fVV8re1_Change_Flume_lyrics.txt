1 ContributorPetty Change Lyrics
Waves- Waves season

Tell me have u got it or no
I’m I boss if you talk flows
I make beats then I lace tracks
Everyday I say tar Mac but it’s not roads
See I been billing up yeah fam I got loads
I learnt at times u gotta do on your own
Couple niggas try do a man dirt
So I went through with a Henry on my jones
And now we got a new place that we call home
It’s home
See I told man how it was cold
Holla fam but most didn’t wanna know
Easily feel blue like he was in the next room
Putting on a tough face I was Edwardo
Puffin on the drive trying to increase my drive but the stress was heavy cargo
Lemme go man life was one big brawl
Can’t wait till the day when I’m settling scores
What’s that I don’t wanna hear that shit
I write better lyrics sittin on the train bored
Man think they’re sick by writing in fours
Whilst I’m here putting my life in metaphors
My word is bond yeah on my unborns
And erm your wrong if you think I’d trust yours
I Gotta Run it up manna gotta buss
No game fuck a Double Dutch gotta double funds
And I know it shouldn't be a bout ps
But I couldn’t get a trim blud lookin Solomon
Mom wanted me gone telling me to Set a date
I was Tryna accelerate couldn’t get a way
Anyway here’s to better days
When I make a milly petty change ima celebrate lemme tell ya
You might also like
Still so far to go look how far we’ve came
Anything is possible first you gotta play
You’re going under if you’re getting in my way
I’m tryna turn a milly into petty change
And you know you’ve gotta have patience wait cah
You’ll get the time where there’s a vacant space yeah
It’s either early or on time it’s never late
So go and turn a milly into petty change

Do U hear what I’m sayin
Petty change fuck a filling station
Just gotta work hard  that’s the basics
Bass shit
Had to leave space fam let the bass hit
Stay in black still fuck a racist
They ain’t shit all it takes is
PCs seeing me to feel interrogated
Elevating its time to go n gain pounds
Eat well with the team n do the team proud
I ain’t tryna  get round
Just get a v12 so I can get around
Keep my head down I’ve put my foot down till I can put my foot down n hear that shit growl
Man I gotta hear them Tyres screeching fires still heating it won’t burnout
So if you’ve started please Don’t stop now
Nah don’t pause it’s there for the taking go n get yours
Cuz your time is now
Yeah it’s your time
Go n get yours Ima go n get mine
So if you’ve started please Don’t stop now
Nah don’t pause it’s there for the taking go n get yours
