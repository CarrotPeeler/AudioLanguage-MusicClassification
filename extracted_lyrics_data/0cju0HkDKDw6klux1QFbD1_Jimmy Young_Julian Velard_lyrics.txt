1 ContributorJimmy Young LyricsJimmy Young played piano at the bar
My Dad said Jimmy Young coulda been a superstar
1967, a year to remember
Summer of love ran through September
Girls in the village, heaven was never far
With Jimmy Young at the bar
Jimmy Young, he could kill you with a song
My Dad said Jimmy Young made you feel like you belong
Winter in the city was hard to handle
Blew the dream out like a candle
The bar was silent
Empty from dusk till dawn
Jimmy Young was gone
I've been singing my heart out
For the best years of my life
Now I’m wondering what it's all about
Tell me, where's the rainbow and the pot of gold
For this lonely thirty-three-year-old?
Is that where you are, Jimmy?
Is a piano bar the only place I’ll ever be?
My dad says I'm Jimmy Young
My dad says I'm Jimmy Young
I am Jimmy Young
I am Jimmy YoungYou might also likeEmbed
