6 ContributorsCome Together Lyrics
Here come old flat top, he come groovin' up slowly
He got ju-ju eyeball, he one holy roller
He got hair down to his knees
Got to be a joker, he just do what he please

He wear no shoeshine, he got toe-jam football
He got monkey finger, he shoot Coca-Cola
He say I know you, you know me
One thing I can tell you is you got to be free
Come together, right now
Over me
Hey!

He bag production, he got walrus gumboot
He got Ono sideboard, he one spinal cracker
He got feet down below his knees
Hold you in his armchair, you can feel his disease
Come together, right now
Over me

He roller coaster, he got early warning
He got muddy water, he one Mojo filter
He say one and one and one is three
Got to be good looking 'cause he's so hard to see
Come together right now
Over me
Over me
Yeah

Come together, yeah
Come together, yeah
Come together
Come together, yeah
Come together, yeahEmbed
