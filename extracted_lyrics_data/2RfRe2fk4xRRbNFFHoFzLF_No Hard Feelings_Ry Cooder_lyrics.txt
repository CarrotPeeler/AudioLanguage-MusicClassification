2 ContributorsNo Hard Feelings Lyrics
This land should have been our land
You took it for your land
You got a use for every stream and tree
When I go up the highway old trees are dying up that way
You pumped out the water and you sold it back to me
You build mansions in the city, prisons in Mojave
You're quite a pillar of high society
You call it law and order, I call it dirty money
You lock the young ones down or send 'em off to war

But it's no hard feelings, no offense taken
You're just a ripple in the shifting sands of time
No bad karma, no curses on ya
You go your way and I'll go mine

You remind me of a fellow I heard of in the city
He's a nervous kind of fellow, he loved money like you do
But he derived no satisfaction so he jumped clear out the window
And they tell me that he bounced a time or two
So take in mind the credo of a jackass prospector
Take what you need but please leave the rest alone
Try and live harmony with old Mother Nature
And you'll remain in grace after you have gone
You might also like

Well I don't get many callers, that little road goes nowhere
I've been here 40 years, seems like yesterday
There's an oId screech owl living in my chimney
And I don 't build no fires and he keeps the mice away

But it's no hard feelings, no offense taken
You're just a ripple, the shifting sands of time
No bad karma, no curses on ya
You go your way, I'll go mine
Well it's no hard feelings, no offense taken
You're just a murmur on the whispering sands of time
No bad karma, no curses on ya
You'll go your way and I'll go mineEmbed
