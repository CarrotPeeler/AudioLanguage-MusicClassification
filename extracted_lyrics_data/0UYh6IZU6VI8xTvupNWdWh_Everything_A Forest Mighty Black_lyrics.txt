Ayy, ya-a-a
Very fucking many of you worthless fuckers, fucking tired me off, very fucking many-y-y

I smoke under a black downpour and you're dumb if you decide to disturb
I might become a black wolf that will rip off all your skin
These people bug me off, I can get angry
My name is P-H-A-R-A-O-H, I rep the death
My hair is like gray ashes, blunt, a bonfire is burning in the forest
She will say, «I wanna eat you like tiramisu»
I say, «No way, bitch, step back a mile»
I only like to kill the ones like you in abundance
(Rest in peace)
The industry is full of hoes and faggots
I'm just talking about it, I'm wearing only half a mask
Stupid little pussy, will you want the smoke with me?
I'll cut ya'll up while blue willow smokes in the fangs
I'm the master of this pain, a forest of corpses is stretches behind me
After the carnage, I smoke, greeting the morning
I saved her life, now I am the idol of her cult
I'ma disappear into the fog, loneliness is wisdom

What the fuck you thought, that at least for a second
You capable of really fuck with me
I like to be alone and I don't turn on my phone
And everything I touch was covered with ice, yuh
You fucking talked about how much you hate, and now you're my fan
Tell me, aren't you pathetic?
You're fucking dangerous, for kids with retarded brains
Your mom writes complaints to the generals
She says, «Siemens, you got a flow»
I tell her, «Don't talk to me, hoe»
The whole club froze when I was smoking raw
Don't talk to me, motherfucker, I'm not your bro
She says, «Siemens, you got a flow»
I tell her, «Don't talk to me, hoe»
The whole club froze when I was smoking raw
Don't talk to me, motherfucker, I'm not your bro
Scum!

— Aye, captain!

I do not know any of you — a lone warrior
I'mma crush your mouth with metal, I'm smoking on an ice throne
I do not know any of you — a lone warrior
I'mma crush your mouth with metal, I'm smoking on an ice throne
I do not know any of you — a lone warrior
I'mma crush your mouth with metal, I'm smoking on an ice throne
I do not know any of you — a lone warrior
I'mma crush your mouth with metal, I'm smoking on an ice throneEmbed
