"Gentle Giant, how would you describe your music?"
"Well, I guess (unintelligible)"

As years drift by and future dies
As years drift by and future dies

(As years drift by and future dies)
He sits and he thinks about all he's done in life
(As years drift by and future dies)
I'm now an old man, what have I been in life?
(As years drift by and future dies, as years drift by, drift by)
What did I do? Had no end to aspire to

(As years drift by and future dies)
His dreams as a boy were of hope and intention
(As years drift by and future dies)
Of making his mark with his plans and invention
(As years drift by and future dies, as years drift)
Where did they go? How could he know how time goes?

In my day, had to have certain future
But now you can do as you like
All that I might have wanted
Seeking what you're after but not for me
You might also like

Made my way only as I'm able
I thought everything may come to me
Made my way only as I'm able
I thought everything may come to me
Made my way only as I'm able
I thought everything may come to me
Made my way only as I'm able
I thought everything may come to me
Made my way only as I'm able

Everything come to me, made my way as able
Everything come to me, made my way as able
Everything come to me, made my way as able
Everything come to me, made my way as

(As years drift by and future dies)
(As years drift by and future dies)
He knows there's no more he can do, no romances
(As years drift by and future dies)
Now bitten today for they have all his chances
(As years drift by and future dies, as years drift by, drift by)
All too late, no one waits, how time goes by
All that I might, all that I might
All that I might, all that I might
Drift by
Have as my years drift by never for meEmbed
