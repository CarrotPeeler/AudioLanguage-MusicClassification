18 ContributorsClash City Rockers Lyrics
And I wanna move the town to the Clash City rockers
Ya' need a little jump of electrical shocker
Better leave town if you only wanna knock us
Nothing stands the pressure of the Clash City rockers
See them as they come down the escalator
Now listen to the tube train accelerator
Then ya' realize that you've gotta have a purpose
Or this place is gonna knock you out sooner or later

(So don't complain) about your useless employment
Jack it in forever tonight
(Or shut your mouth) and pretend you enjoy it
Think of all the money you've got

And I want to liquefy everybody gone dry
Or plug into the aerial that poke up in the sky
Burn down the suburbs with the half-closed eyes
You won't succeed unless you try

(So don't complain) about your useless employment
Jack it in forever tonight
(Or shut your mouth) and pretend you enjoy it
Think of all the money you've got
Yeah, yeah
You might also like
Yes, I wanna move the town to the Clash City rockers
Ya' need a little jump of electrical shocker
You better leave town if ya' only wanna knock us
Nothing stands the pressure of the Clash City rockers

You owe me a move say the bells of St. Groove
Come on and show me say the bells of Old Bowie
When I am fitter say the bells of Gary Glitter
No one but you and I say the bells of Prince Far-I
No one but you and I say the bells of Prince Far-I

And I wanna move the town to the Clash City rockers
Ya' need a little jump of electrical shockers
Better leave town if ya' only wanna knock us
Nothing stands the pressure of the Clash City rockers
