Close enough to be alive
So it feels lost
Another way to settle down
Another way, another life

Deep inside, you and I
Sitting on the side
Close tonight we'll be inside
On the other way, on the other side


Close enough to be alive
So it feels lost
Another way to settle down
Another way, another life

Deep inside, you and I
Sitting on the side
Close tonight we'll be inside
On the other way, on the other sideYou might also like1Embed
