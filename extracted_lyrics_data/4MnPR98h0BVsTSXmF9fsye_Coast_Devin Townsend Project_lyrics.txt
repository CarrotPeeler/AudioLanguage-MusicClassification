5 ContributorsCoast LyricsThe way it goes, is the way it goes
I'm all right to go
So go, you go
They took their things and headed for the coast
Denied of all in life they needed most
Loves forgotten child
Born into the wild
Come to the coast, come to the coast
Come to the coast, it will find you
The fallout from the California glow
Toronto's frozen over this every man should know
I've forgotten now
Would you show me how?
Coast
Come
Run away, just run away from here
Just run away, just run away my dear
'Cause love's forgotten child
So go into the wild
Come
Somebody took me away...something controls me...You might also likeEmbed
