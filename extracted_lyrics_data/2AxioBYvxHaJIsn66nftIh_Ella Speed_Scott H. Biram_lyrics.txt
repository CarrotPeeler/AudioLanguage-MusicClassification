1 ContributorElla Speed LyricsWell the first time I shot Ella
Shot her through the side
Second time I could not tell when
But the third time i shot her
Shot her in the head
You know that shot must've killed poor Ella dead
When they all found out the news
Ella Speed is dead
Took her down and dressed her up in red
There was two white horses
Side and side
Taking Ella on her last farewell ride
Ella 'fore she died
Last word she said
"tell my sisters don't do like me"
That is to fall in love with just anyone
Isn't everyone mmm that she sees
One of these mornings
When you out havin' fun
Somebody gone do like Ella done
Ella went out
Just to have some fun
And she got shot down by a colt 41

I shot Ella once
Didn't shoot her no more
She staggered across the bar room floor
Hard ain't it hard
Man but it's true
You can love someone who don't love youEmbed
