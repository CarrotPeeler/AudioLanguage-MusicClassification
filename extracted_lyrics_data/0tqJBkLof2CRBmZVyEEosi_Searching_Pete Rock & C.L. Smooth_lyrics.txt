(Searchin', searchin', searchin', searchin')

You're everythin' that I dream about, talk about
Walk around and brag about, 'cause I don't give a damn about
What they say, what he say or she say
I'm addicted like drugs to your lovin', but hey!
You got me strung like I'm young and it's crazy
You're makin' me nervous, I don't deserve this, I'm Swayze
I wish I could be, but you really got a hold on me
With your sex appeal, I'm tellin' you how I feel, shit is real
Now, I don't really want to play myself
So I say to myself, "Self, get a grip and don't slip"
'Cause I don't want you to think I'm some clown from outta town
I get down, I've been around, I ain't no hand-me-down
So you gotta show respect for me if you're checkin' for me
And don't sweat me 'cause I really don't want no sweat on me
If you got it, good, flaunt it
You know what it takes, and you know how I want it

I know how you want it
(Searchin', searchin')
Don't tease me, just please me
I know how you want it
(Searchin', searchin')
Now, what you gonna do when you get it?
You might also like
Everybody knows you and they show you mad respect
You give me funny feelings with your million-dollar step
Never quiet is kept, honey always stay dip
I'm thirsty for your love, sugar, can I get a sip?
Or maybe just a taste in the place that make your face bend
And I would never try to kick it to your best friend
So what's the deal? What's the haps? Where we at now?
Keepin' it strong, movin' along, I'm here to show you how
So all I wanna know is what you really wanna do
I try to flex, but sex ain't sex unless I'm sexin' you
And I'll be swimmin' in some trim with a beachfront view
'Cause all I wanna do is get next to you
Now leave your crew so we can step into my hideaway
So I can step into it right away
If you got it, good, flaunt it
You know what it takes, and you know how I want it

I know how you want it
(Searchin', searchin')
Don't tease me, just please me
I know how you want it
(Searchin', searchin')
Now, what you gonna do when you get it?
Before you sit back and think I ain't sayin' nothin'
You need to sit back and think about what I'm sayin'
Now relayin' my Carmel flow
So you can see the arrow fly before it leaves the bow
Slow like Cupid, taken from a mobster
At night, I crack her open just like a lobster
(Oh! My CL Smooth...) It's all good, baby
Now you know why I'm stressed when you act shady
Sometimes you chit-chat, now and then hide the cat
When all I wanna do is just flip that
But there's a side to me only you can see
Only you can, so believe in your man
I want you to love me in a special way
When I come home from makin' lucci to parlay
If you got it, good, flaunt it
You know what it takes, and you know how I want it

I know how you want it
(Searchin', searchin')
Don't tease me, just please me
I know how you want it
(Searchin', searchin')
Now, what you gonna do when you get it?7Embed
