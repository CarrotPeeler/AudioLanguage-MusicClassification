All my life I've been searchin'
All my life I've been uncertain
I've been abandoned and left alone
At fifteen I had to leave home
The black sheep, the bad seed

At a roadside bar in Tennessee
I met an angel to rescue me
She rescued me

She wore blue jeans and a rosary
Believed in God and believed in me
And all her friends think she's a little crazy
She wears a smile, heart on her sleeve
I don't give a damn what the world thinks of me
She tells me it's all good
She's happy with a bad seed
Happy to be misunderstood

Two packs and a pint a day to hide the shame
And wash away the pain, all the pain
Every road was a dead-end street
Runnin' from the law and running on empty
You couldn't shake the marks that were left on me

At a roadside bar in Tennessee
I met an angel to rescue me
She rescued me

She wore blue jeans and a rosary
Believed in God and believed in me
And all her friends think she's a little crazy
She wears a smile, heart on her sleeve
I don't give a damn what the world thinks of me
She tells me it's all good
She's happy with a bad seed
Happy to be misunderstood


She wore blue jeans and a rosary
Believed in God and believed in me
And all her friends think she's a little crazy
She wears a smile, heart on her sleeve
I don't give a damn what the world thinks of me
She tells me it's all good
She's happy with a bad seed
She's happy to be misunderstood
