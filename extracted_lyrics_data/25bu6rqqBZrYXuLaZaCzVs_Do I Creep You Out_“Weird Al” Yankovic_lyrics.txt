16 ContributorsDo I Creep You Out Lyrics
I know that you don't know me very well
We've barely met but I can surely tell
No one will ever love you like I do
I like to feel the warm spot on your chair
Sometimes I drool and usually I stare
My precious one
I saved that gum that you threw in the garbage

You're the one I dream about
But the only question with me now
Is, "Do I creep you out?"
Every time I shake your hand now
Wanna stick your fingers in my mouth
Well, do I creep you out?

Call you every night and hang up
Gonna carve your name in my leg
In my leg, oh oh!

Somethin' I should ask about
Can I sniff the pit stains on your blouse?
And do I creep you
Do I creep you out?
(Your restraining order's out)
(Still the only question with me now)
Oh the only question
(Is, "Do I creep you out?")
Is "Do I creep you out?"
Know exactly where you live now
Follow you from work right to your house
Well, do I creep you out?
Do I creep you out?See “Weird Al” Yankovic LiveGet tickets as low as $30You might also likeEmbed
