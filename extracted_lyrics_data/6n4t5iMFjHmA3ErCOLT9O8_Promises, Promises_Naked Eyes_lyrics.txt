11 ContributorsPromises, Promises LyricsI never had a doubt in the beginning
Never a doubt
I trusted you true in the beginning
I loved you right through
Arm in arm, we laughed like kids
At all the silly things we did
You made me promises, promises
Knowing I'd believe
Promises, promises
You knew you'd never keep
Second time around and I'm retreating
I'm losing my ground
This time around, there's no believing
What you wanted to have found
You were saying you and me
Are not your style or cup of tea
You made me promises, promises
You knew you'd never keep
Promises, promises
Why do I believe?

At all the silly things we did
And now you're saying you and me
Are not your style or cup of tea
You made me promises, promises
You knew you'd never keep
Promises, promises
Why do I believe?
All of your promises
You knew you'd never keep
Promises, promises
Why do I believe?
Promises, promises
Promises, promises
Promises, promises
Promises, promises
Promises, promises
