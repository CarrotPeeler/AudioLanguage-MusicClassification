1 ContributorDe Chirico Street LyricsI was followed home by a weighing machine
On De Chirico Street
It said, "What do you know?" I said, "What do you mean?"
On De Chirico Street
And the numbers turned to fingers
And the fingers turned to flies
And they buzzed around your portrait
I was followed home by a 73
On De Chirico Street
It was advertising you and me
On De Chirico Street
In the photograph we kissed
The conductor's name was Milo
As the bus went past, he hissed
"Fleshhead!"
A hyena sprang, she was on all fours
On De Chirico Street
And her outline showed through a strip of gauze
On De Chirico Street
If you meet me by the clock
I can kiss you through the window
'Cause you love that sudden shock
Don't moralize
Get on with it
You can go
Now you've discharged all your responsibilties
N-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-now now now
On De Chirico Street
Ah... ah...
As the sundial fell, it was oh so black
On De Chirico Street
And the lizard's tail slithered in the crack
On De Chirico Street
And the pale yellow globes
Flickered softly through the window
As you paced the night with strobes
It's the darkest dream in the whole wide world
On De Chirico Street
It's a bat, it's a bat, it's a bat, it's a girl
On De Chirico Street
In my pocket, nightmares dress
I said, "Jasper, this one's evil!"
But I love my lioness... My lioness!You might also likeEmbed
