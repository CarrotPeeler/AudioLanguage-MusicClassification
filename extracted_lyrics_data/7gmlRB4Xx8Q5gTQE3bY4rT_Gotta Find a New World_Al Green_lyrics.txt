4 ContributorsGotta Find a New World Lyrics
As I look at this world
You know, I'm beginning to see
That this is not the world
That God intended it to be
Oh, no, no, no, no, no
That's why you hear me say now

I got to find a new world
Where the people understand
How to treat one another
Throughout the land, yeah
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Everybody pack up and go with me, now
I got to find a new world
Where the people get along, you and me
Where everybody loves each other
Every day and, hey, L-O-V-E, yeah, yeah, yeah, hey

La-da-ha, la-la, a new world
La-da-ha, la-la, a new world
La-da-ha, la-la, la-da
La-la-la-la (Ooh), la-la, la-la, oh-oh-oh-oh
Come on, come on and go with me

Uh, I wanna hear people say (Can I help ya?)
I got to hear people say (Come on in), ah
I, I wanna hear people say (Is there anything I can do for you?), yeah
I got to hear people say (Let me help you), oh
Ha, I wanna be able to walk when I wanna
I got to be able to talk when I wanna
I wanna be able to love when I need it
Yeah, yeah, alright now
Come on and go with me, everâ€” gotta find, uh, uh
Oh, got to find a new world, baby
Got to, got to find it, baby, nowEmbed
