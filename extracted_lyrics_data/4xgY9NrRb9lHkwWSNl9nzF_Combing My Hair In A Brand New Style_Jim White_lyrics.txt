2 ContributorsCombing My Hair in a Brand New Style LyricsI found a blue hair comb with a busted tooth
Gonna comb out my hair in this telephone booth
Gonna comb out love
Gonna comb out hate gonna get me a new look
And I can't wait
I took a lethal dosage of dope in my youth
Bit the hook of Jesus, aw, the terrible truth
I swallowed it hard for a damn good while
But now I'm combing my hair in a brand new style
Combing my hair, yeah
Combing my hair, yeah
Combing my hair, yeah
Combing my hair, yeah
Combing my hair, yeah
Combing my hair, yeah
Combing my hair, yeah
Combing my hair in a brand new style
I take a midnight stroll in a Love's supermarket
I like passing the rows of candy for sale
See the pale pretty girls in the magazines?
Smiling at me like they know what I mean
You take your candy dandy, your cheap girls ruthless!
Soul suckers all gonna end up toothless!
Gumming the truth of life's discount aisle
Me, I'm combing my hair in a brand new style

Combing my hair in a brand new style

He used a blue hair comb with a busted tooth
To comb out the tangles of his messed up youth
Returning in glory to the scene of his trial
He was combing his hair in a brand new style
Yeah the sorry story of his assorted crimes
His tribulations, his suffering mind
All wiped clean and left miles behind
See him prowling the street?
He got the mojo smile
He's combing his hair in a brand new style
Combing my hair, yeah
Combing my hair in a brand new style
I don't want no hoodoos, no voodoo gurus, no spooked out priesty-beasty
No strippers with pasties
Self-professed saviors of my soul
No low-down top-secret CIA moles
No crackpot psychopathic behavior specialists, no shriners
No shiners, no decisive moment existentialists
That's right, no vegetable, no mineral
No institution gonna disrupt the constitution of my ingenious hairdo solution
See, I got my sly pomade
My jelly in a jar!
Now don't you mistake me for no movie star
'Cause I'm just a humble jumble of God's crooked smile
Did you check out my hair in the brand new style?
Combing my hair, yeah
