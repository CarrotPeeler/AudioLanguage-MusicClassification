Tonight, I can tell
You need to get out
Grab your money, lock the door
You won't be back here 'til tomorrow

I don't know but I've been told
There's a new club open tonight

Let's go out and have a party
Like we never have before
Let's go out and have a good time
'Cause we never have before

Tonight (tonight), I can tell (I can tell)
Things haven't gone (things haven't gone) so well (so well)
Grab your money (grab your money)
Get out the door (get out the door)
You won't see me here anymore

I don't know but I've been told
Places like this are gettin' old
You might also like
Let's go out and have a party
Like we never have before
Let's go out and have a good time
'Cause we never have before
Let's go out and have a party
Like we never have before
Let's go out and have a good time
'Cause we never have beforeEmbed
