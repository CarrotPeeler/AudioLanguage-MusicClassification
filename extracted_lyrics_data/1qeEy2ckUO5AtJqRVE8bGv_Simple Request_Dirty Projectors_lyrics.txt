2 ContributorsSimple Request Lyrics
I want to know who you are right now
Who you are right now
I wonder why, and I wonder what, and I wonder how
Promise child, promise me
You'll see what you saw today

Never will we give up
Never will we tear
Never will we tire
Never capitulate

I was alone till I saw you lie
Till I saw you lie
I was a bone now I break in half
Now I break in half
Gone a mile, gone a day
Frayed  and torn, smile anyway

Never will we give up
Never will we tear
Never will we tire
Never capitulateYou might also likeEmbed
