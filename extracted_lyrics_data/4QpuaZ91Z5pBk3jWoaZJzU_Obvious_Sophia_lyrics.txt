2 ContributorsObvious LyricsHey
What am I supposed to say?
Babe
Can't you see that I'm hurting here?
And I know that I promised I would never be your shadow
But why you'd have to bring your light back in to my life?
And why do we fight it deny it defy it?
Oh isn't it obvious?
Why do we fight it deny it defy it?
Oh isn't it obvious?
Oh isn't it obvious?
And hey?
Is there something you'd like to say?
Babe
You disappear and then you reappear
And I know that I promised I would never be your shadow
But then you had to bring your light back in to my life...
And why do we fight it deny it defy it?
Oh isn't it obvious?
Why do we fight it deny it defy it?
Oh isn't it obvious?
Oh isn't it obvious?
That to me
That to me
We're still a perfect 3

We were still a perfect 3?Embed
