19 ContributorsIce Out Lyrics
MTM hit 'em with the heat!

Ice-Ice out, let it shine, got my teeth out (Okay)
Shawty bad, geeked up off that rerock (Ayy, ayy)
Ten toes down, designer, baby, all I know (All I know)
Skrrt skrrt on the Range, now I gotta go
Ice out, let it shine, got my teeth out (Ayy)
Shawty bad, geeked up off that rerock (Okay)
Ten toes down, designer, baby, all I know (Ayy)
Skrrt skrrt on the Range, now I gotta go

Black top Coupe too fast, they ain't see the plate
I just poured a four in my Sprite, I ain't even dazed
Now we off the shit, lil' shawty wanna upgrade
Skrrt skrrt, zoom, in my Audi, catch me skinning snakes (Skrrt, skrrt)
All I know is keep a shooter by me (Phew, phew, phew)
Sauced up, watch everybody copy
Chain's too much, you can't even catch up
Star flex, pussy boy, get your bands up

I'm okay now, percy keep the pain out
All the lean get me stuck, wanna break out
I'm okay now, percy keep the pain out
All the lean get me stuck, wanna break out

Ice-Ice out, let it shine, got my teeth out (Okay)
Shawty bad, geeked up off that rerock (Ayy, ayy)
Ten toes down, designer, baby, all I know (All I know)
Skrrt skrrt on the Range, now I gotta go
Ice out, let it shine, got my teeth out (Ayy)
Shawty bad, geeked up off that rerock (Okay)
Ten toes down, designer, baby, all I know (Ayy)
Skrrt skrrt on the Range, now I gotta go

â€‹blackbear getting dome in the Wraith now
Whole team rich, eight figure bank now
So much Raf, A$AP Rocky would be mad
Baby, you can touch my Rafs, it's all good, I've got doubles
I be in Miami, Club 11, making trouble
I be yelling all them more bubbles, more bubbles, more
Next to all the rappers that I used to open for
Now I'm playing in arenas, got they bitches knees on the floor

I'm okay now, percy keep the pain out
All the lean get me stoked, wanna break out
I'm okay now, percy keep the pain out
All the lean get me stuck, wanna break out
Ice-Ice out, let it shine, got my teeth out (Okay)
Shawty bad, geeked up off that rerock (Ayy, ayy)
Ten toes down, designer, baby, all I know (All I know)
Skrrt skrrt on the Range, now I gotta go
Ice out, let it shine, got my teeth out (Ayy)
Shawty bad, geeked up off that rerock (Okay)
Ten toes down, designer, baby, all I know (Ayy)
Skrrt skrrt on the Range, now I gotta go

I'm okay now, percy keep the pain out
All the lean get me stoked, wanna break out
I'm okay now, percy keep the pain out
All the lean get me stuck, wanna break out8Embed
