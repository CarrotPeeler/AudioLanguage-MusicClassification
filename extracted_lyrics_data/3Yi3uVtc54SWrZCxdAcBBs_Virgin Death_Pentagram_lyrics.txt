10 ContributorsSacrifice LyricsHooded figures, clouded skies
Fires burn within their eyes
Pentagram with Baphomet, midnight strikes
Goat of Mendes lifts his head
Summons up the living dead
Virgin flesh lies tied and bound
Hail Sathanas
S.A.C.R.I.F.I.C.E
Scream for mercy, cry and repent, Satan claims your soul
Sacrifice, sacrifice
Oh, so nice, sacrifice
Candles glow on altars bare
A virgin's death is needed there
Sacrifice to Lucifer, my master
Bring the chalice, raise the knife
Welcome to my sacrifice
Plunge the dagger in her breast
I insist
S.A.C.R.I.F.I.C.E
Limbs weaken, life flies away, demons rejoice
Sacrifice, sacrifice
Name your price, sacrifice

Light 'em up!
S.A.C.R.I.F.I.C.E
Limbs weaken, life flies away, demons rejoice
The sacrifice, sacrifice
Sacrifice, sacrifice
Death is swift 'neath Satan's sword
All the same, young and old
Life means nothing to my Lord
Drink from chalice warm and sweet
Virgin's heart final beat
Lightning strikes, virgin dies
Satan smiles
S.A.C.R.I.F.I.C.E
The moon is black and the witches dance, Heaven is denied
Sacrifice, sacrifice
Sacrifice, sacrificeEmbed
