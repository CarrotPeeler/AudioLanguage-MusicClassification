What can I do
Honey, I wanna drink
From that lovin' cup, too
Honey, I wanna drink
From that lovin' cup too
You should be downtown working
Making lots of money
Instead of walking these streets
Baby, acting funny
Won't you tell me something, buddy
What can I do
Honey, I wanna drink
From that lovin' cup, too
Honey, I wanna drink
From that lovin' cup too
You don't wash your hair
You don't wash your clothes
What else you don't do
Baby, nobody knows
Won't you tell me something, buddy
What can I do
Honey, I wanna drink
From that lovin' cup, too
Honey, I wanna drink
From that lovin' cup too

Making lots of money
Instead of walking these streets
Baby, acting funny
Won't you tell me something, buddy
What can I do
Honey, I wanna drink
From that lovin' cup, too
Honey, I wanna drink
From that lovin' cup too
From that lovin' cup, tooEmbed
