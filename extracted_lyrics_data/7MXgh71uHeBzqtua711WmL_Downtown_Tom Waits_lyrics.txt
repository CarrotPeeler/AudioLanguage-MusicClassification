7 ContributorsDowntown Lyrics
Red Pants and the Sugarman in the Temple Street gloom
Drinkin' Chivas Regal in a four-dollar room
Just another dead soldier in a powder-blue light
Sugarman says, "Baby, everything's alright"

Goin' downtown
Down, downtown
Goin' down downtown

Montclaire de Havelin doin' the St. Vitus dance
Lookin' for someone to chop the lumber in his pants
How am I gonna unload all of this ice and all this mink?
All the traffic in the streets, but it's so hard to think

Goin' downtown
Down, downtown
Goin' down downtown

Frankie's wearin' lipstick, Pierre Cardin
I swear to God, I seen him holdin' hands with Jimmy Bones
Sally's high on crank, hungry for some sweets
Femme in the sheets, but she's butch in the streets
You might also like
Goin' downtown
Down, downtown
Goin' down downtown

It's the cool of the evening, the sun's goin' down
I want to hold you in my arms, I want to push you around
I wanna break your bottle and spill out all your charms
Come on baby, we'll set off all the burglar alarms

Goin' downtown
Down, downtown
Goin' down downtown

Red Pants and the Sugarman in the Temple Street gloom
Are drinkin' Chivas Regal in a four-dollar room
Just another dead soldier in a powder-blue night
Red Pants says to Sugarman, said everything's alright

Goin' downtown
Down, downtown
Goin' down downtownEmbed
