You think you're alive, motherfucker
You're just the walking fucking dead
You're fucking sheep, stepping on my back to stay alive
West Coast, East Coast, you're all bunch of fucking fools
You and the rest of this greedy fucking world
Kill yourself, stay in school, say "no" to drugs
And, oh, yeah, hail Satan
Good night, boys and girls... Pleasant dreams

The public is shocked by the people's opinions
They crush your dreams and foreclose your dominions
You always stand there, a reader digesting
You never bother to ask any questions

Hate your state

Now, I know my rights; get out of my way
I won't fall for the lies that you say
You want me to kneel down; you want me to pray
Now you're laughing, 'cause it's me that will pay

Hate your state
Hate your state
Hate your state
Hate your state
You might also like
(The) people, stupid and happy and set in their ways
Content as their lives grow sick and decay
The readers all stand there, digesting the system
See? You don't have to be choking to become a victim!

Yeah, hate your state
Hate your state
Hate your state
Hate your state!

Hate your state
Hate your state
Hate your state
State, state, state, state
State, state, state!Embed
