3 ContributorsPersuasion LyricsYou want
What i want
Easy
Seemingly
Phone call
Pick it up
News in
Head drops
You see
Our love
Use it
Let it heal you
Dont fight
We're losing
More time
In our lives
Cuz
I won't let you down
I won't let you down either way
We'll come back around
We'll return from this place
You might also likeI will pick you up
I will lift you up all the way
We won't be deterred
We won't let this be fate
You keep
Searchin'
For answers
For some meaning
Intake
Output
Not always equal
It's understood
So keep us
In motion
Give yourself
A new hope
I feel
What you feel
Hold tight
Don't let it kill us
Cuz
I won't let you down
I won't let you down either way
We'll come back around
We'll return from this place
I will pick you up
I will lift you up all the way
We won't be deterred
We won't let this be fateEmbed
