1 ContributorGold Digger LyricsHey Mr Gold Man where's my pay?
Hmm. Mr Gold Man not one more day
Mister, can't you hear my children cry?
Came to Pretoria in '46, find myself a job
Met a man with a broken arm, he said:
"Come along with us, get onto the bus"
Hey Mr Gold Man, I am for sale!
Hey Mr Gold Man. Please don't turn away
Hey Mr Gold Man, Can't you hear my tummy rumbling?
("Hey! You a gold digger? There's a job for gold diggers here
You won't get much – but it's a way to survive.")
So we continued down the road, till we got to the mine
Dirt and dust all around us now – Hey! I didn't mind
'Cause I'm on the workline, oh oh
Hey Mr Gold Man, where's my pay?
Oh Mr Gold Man, can't wait another day
Oh Mr Gold Man, can't you see I'm almost dying?
("I'm a gold digger man
22 pence a shift – no overtime")

Come and join the Union, boy. ‘Cause today, we ain't going down
We're gonna stand our ground"
Hey Mr Gold Man, where's my pay?
Oh Mr Gold Man, won't wait another day
Oh Mr Gold Man, can't you hear the thunder coming?
Hey Mr Gold Man, loose these chains
Time Mr Gold Man, change is on its way
Go Mr Gold Man, don't come back, this is my country now
("You'd better be leaving now – Mr Gold Man")Embed
