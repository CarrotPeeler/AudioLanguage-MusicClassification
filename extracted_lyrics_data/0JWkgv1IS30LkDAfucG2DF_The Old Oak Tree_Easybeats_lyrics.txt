2 ContributorsThe Old Oak Tree Lyrics
Hey!
Well, if you want a love that's oh so true
Then my love should do for you

Well, just come lookin' 'round for me
You'll find me sittin' by an old oak tree
Well, come, oh yeah, well, come, uh-huh
Just come looking by

Well, if you want a love that wouldn't die
I wouldn't cheat or tell a lie

Well, just come lookin' 'round for me
You'll find me sittin' by an old oak tree
Well, come, uh-huh, well, come, uh-huh
Just come
All yours, Harry
Mmmhm
I love the way you play your pretty guitar
Ooh
You might also like
To end my story, I'm tellin' you, dear
With my love you have no fear

Just come lookin' 'round for me
You'll find me sittin' by an old oak tree
Well, come, oh-oh, well, come, uhh
Just come lookin' by an old oak tree
Once more, Harry
Oh!
Yeah, Harry
Ooh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

To end my story, I'm tellin' you, dear
With my love you have no fear

Just come lookin' 'round for me
Ooh, you'll find me sittin' by an old oak tree
Well, come, oh, yeah, well, come, uh-huh
Just come lookin' by an old oak tree
Brrr, by the old oak tree
Sittin' by that river there
Mm, yeah, that's rightEmbed
