On a heartbreak beat, yeah
All night long
And nobody don't dance
On the edge of the dark
We've got the radio on

And it feels like love
But it don't mean a lot
And it feels like love
And it's all that we've got

There's a heartbreak beat playing all night long
Down on my street
And it feels like love, got the radio on
And it's all that we need
There's a heartbreak beat
And it feels like love
There's a heartbreak beat
And it feels like love

When the beat don't stop
And we talk so tough
And there's a perfect kiss
Somewhere out in the dark
But a kiss ain't enough
You might also like
And the world don't stop
Every time that you call
And the world don't stop
Every time that you fall

There's a heartbreak beat playing all night long
Down on my street
And it feels like love, got the radio on
And it's all that we need
There's a heartbreak beat
And it feels like love
There's a Heartbreak beat
And it feels like love

On a heartbreak beat, yeah, all night long
And nobody don't dance
On the edge of the dark
We've got the radio on

And it feels like love
But it don't mean a lot
And it feels like love
And it's all that we've got
There's a heartbreak beat playing all night long
Down on my street
And it feels like love, got the radio on
And it's all that we need

There's a heartbreak beat
And it feels like love
There's a heartbreak beat
And it feels like love
There's a heartbreak beat
On a heartbreak beat
On a heartbreak beat
On a heartbreak beat2Embed
