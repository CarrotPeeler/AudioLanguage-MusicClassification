50 ContributorsEmotion Lyrics
Hey, yeah, yeah
Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ooh, yeah

It's over and done
But the heartache lives on inside (Yeah, yeah)
And who is the one you're clinging to
Instead of me tonight?

And where are you now?
Now that I need you
Tears on my pillow
Wherever you go, go
I'll cry me a river
That leads to your ocean
You'll never see me fall apart

In the words of a broken heart, it's just emotions taking me over
Caught up in sorrow, lost in the song
But if you don't come back, come home to me, darlin'
Don't you know, there's no—
Nobody left in this world to hold me tight
And don't you know, there's no—
Nobody left in this world to kiss goodnight (Kiss goodnight)
Goodnight, goodnight, goodnight
Goodnight
You might also like
I'm there at your side
A part of all the things you are (Yeah, yeah)
But you got a part of someone else too
You gotta go find your shining star

And where are you now?
Now that I need you
Tears on my pillow
Wherever you are
I'll cry me a river
That leads to your ocean
You'll never see me fall apart

In the words of a broken heart, it's just emotions taking me over (Taking me over)
Caught up in sorrow, lost in the song (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
But if you don't come back, come home to me, darlin'
Don't you know, there's
Nobody left in this world to hold me tight
Nobody left in this world to hold me tight
Nobody left in this world to kiss goodnight
Nobody left in this world
Goodnight
And where are you now?
Now that I need you, you
Tears on my pillow
Wherever you go
I'll cry me a river
That leads to your ocean
You'll never see me fall apart

In the words of a broken heart, it's just emotions taking me over (Yeah)
Caught up in sorrow, lost in the song (Don't you know I'm lost without you, baby?)
But if you don't come back, come home to me, darlin'
Nobody left in this world to hold me tight (Yeah, nobody)
Nobody to hold me
Nobody left in this world to kiss goodnight
Nobody to kiss me, yeah
Goodnight, goodnight
