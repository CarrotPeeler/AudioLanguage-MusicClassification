2 ContributorsScreaming into the Sky LyricsI feel so powerless
I suffocate on emptiness
I pray to be awoken from this nightmare
So many things I'll never say
So many wounds will never heal
Each breath is filled with overwhelming sorrow
In disbelief of how your life was stolen
In disbelief of what would never be
My only solace is knowing
Somehow your soul is finally free
So I'm screaming into the sky
Cause it's my only way to say goodbye
And I'm still asking for an answer why
Why I never got the chance to say goodbye
Now this is my only way to say to you
That I'm sorry for letting you slip away
I never thought I'd lose you forever
So now I tell the world
So many emotions rush to the surface
But I keep asking myself
Why it had to end like this
Why did it have to end like this
You might also likeSo I'm screaming into the sky
Cause it's my only way to say goodbye
And I'm still asking for an answer why
Why I never got the chance to say goodbye
In your honor I will live my life
Do the best that I can
And in your memory I will take this life for granted
Ever again
To say goodbye
To say goodbye
To say goodbye
To say goodbyeEmbed
