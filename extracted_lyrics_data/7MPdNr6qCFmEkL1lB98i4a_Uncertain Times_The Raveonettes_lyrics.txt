2 ContributorsUncertain Times Lyrics
Too many failed years
And I can't hold her
So many strange times
Have come my way
Too many teardrops, yeah
I don't get it
Life moves on if you want it to

Too many times I've felt
My heart was broken
Wasting time on someone
I don't get
But I've found someone
Who makes me better
Yeah, I've found someone
Who makes me go

I wanna ride with her
In uncertain times
I wanna go where my thoughts
Can take a nap
And if the atom bomb
Should end us both
I'll be happy to go
To the stars with you

I wanna ride with her
In uncertain times
I wanna go where my thoughts
Can take a nap
And if the atom bomb
Should end us both
I'll be happy to go
To the stars with you

I wanna ride with her
In uncertain times
I wanna go where my thoughts
Can take a nap
And if the atom bomb
Should end us both
I'll be happy to go
To the stars with youEmbed
