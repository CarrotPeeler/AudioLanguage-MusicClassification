26 ContributorsMe and Mrs. Jones Lyrics
Me and Mrs. Jones
We got a thing going on
We both know that it's wrong
But it's much too strong
To let it go now

We meet every day at the same café, 6:30, I know, I know she'll be there
Holding hands, making all kinds of plans while the jukebox plays our favorite song

Me and Mrs., Mrs. Jones, Mrs. Jones, Mrs. Jones, Mrs. Jones
We got a thing going on
We both know that it's wrong
But it's much too strong
To let it go now

We gotta be extra careful that we don't build our hopes up too high
'Cause she's got her own obligations and so, and so do I

Me and Mrs., Mrs. Jones, Mrs. Jones, Mrs. Jones, Mrs. Jones
We got a thing going on
We both know that it's wrong
But it's much too strong
To let it go now
You might also like
Well, it's time for us to be leaving, it hurts so much, it hurts so much inside
Now she'll go her way and I'll go mine
But tomorrow, we'll meet the same place, the same time

Me and Mrs., Mrs. Jones, Mrs. Jones, Mrs. Jones, Mrs. Jones
We got a thing going on

We gotta be extra careful, we can't afford to build our hopes up too high
I wanna meet and talk with you at the same place, the same café, the same time
And we're gonna hold hands like we used to, we gonna talk it over, talk it over
We know, they know, and you know and I know it was wrong
But I'm thinking strong
We gotta let 'em know now that we got a thing going on, a thing going on
It's time4Embed
