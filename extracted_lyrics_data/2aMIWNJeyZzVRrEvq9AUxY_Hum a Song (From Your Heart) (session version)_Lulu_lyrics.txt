10 ContributorsHot 97 Freestyle Lyrics
This is a street corner, you know what I mean?
This is not the Hot 97 studio, this is a street corner right now
This is 3 MCs, know what I'm sayin'?
Standing on the side
Standing on the sidewalk, you know what I mean?
Timberland boots, saying? Finessing
Concrete slab under the feet, yeah
Blacking out with Funk Flex
Canibus and DMX with my man Noreaga

Blacking out with Funk Flex
DMX holds the 12 gauge pump, Canibus holds the TEC
Whenever the head is separated from the human body with a sharp enough weapon
The brain remains conscious for 10 seconds
Long enough for me to give you one last message
And when you get to Hell, you can tell Lucifer I said it
Don't ever get it confused
Messing with Canibus, the human Rubik's Cube like you got something to prove
I'm Above the Law, making cops shit in their drawers
They won't even dispatch the call if my name is involved
While you pray to Allah, reading your Quran and your teachings of Muhammad
I'm in my crib studying thuganomics
Niggas wanna murder me, that's why my burgundy Suburban be
Full of Secret Service security
Transporting me back and forth from the Affirmative Action University
In aircrafts that takeoff and land vertically
The fact that I ain't treated like a king is absurd to me
From the streets of Dirty Jersey to Germany, niggas heard of me
Verbally murdering you thoroughly without effort
I get drug tested before I can rhyme on the record
A remarkable specimen with an audible weapon
Processing lyrics in less than one onehundredth of a second
Beef? Bring it! Bullets or barrels, spin it
Fingers squeeze trigger leave you physically disfigured
You might also like
One, two, one, two, come through, run through
Gun who? Oh, you don't know what the gun do?
Some do! Those that know, are real quiet
Let me think you gon' try it, fuck around and start a riot
Niggas gon' buy it regardless
Because I'm the hardest rap artist and I'm a start this
Shit up for real, get up and feel
My words, I make herbs spit up and squeal
Ill, it's all I've been hearing lately, niggas hate me
Wanna duck tape me and make me
Put their brains on the wall when I brawl
Too late for that 911 call
Niggas stay beefin' but a lot of them bluff
But not me 'cause I'm a nigga that can get out of them cuffs
You think a lot of them's tough, that's just a front
'Cause when I hit them niggas like what you want, the battle turns into a hunt
With the dog right behind niggas chasing 'em down
We all knew that you was pussy but I'm tasting it now
And never give a dog blood 'cause raw blow
I have a dog like what? Biting whatever all up in your gut
Give it to 'em raw like that and ain't no love
I do 'em all like that, fall right up in their back clack! clack!
Close your eyes baby, it's over, forget it
Happened in front of your building but nobody knows who did it
(BARK! BARK! BARK!)
Noriega hold me down baby
Yo, my name N.O.R.E., but only fam call me P.A.P.I
Y'all people homos like the cat who killed Versace
Homo thug, yo I shoulda known sooner
My clique stay in jail like Robert Downey Jr
Like outlaw in the beacon, I'm Nigga Rican!
Most y'all people think you live and y'all weakling
I'm from Iraq, play the cut, smoke mad trees
Mind my own business, concentrate on my cheese
Yo, the door locked, four knocks and one sibble
I'm like '98 live, you're like double dribble
Yo Thugged Out , no rules, playing the game
Every man for himself, just receiving the pain
It's like Utah 21, no outs, just go hard
Rest In peace I got to say to Yami and Todd
It's like my people never learn, money to burn
Yo I'm leaving like me and Nate-ness, let me say this
I used to rock the G-U-E with the Double S
Now I'm in the '98 Black GS
Golden wood kid and my shhh on some full grip
Headlights shine from Def Jam to Crown Heights
Now my clique keep guns, no time for fights
Open the flip on star tech, check the message
Cop ten Sprint phones and caught a deal
What? One in the same like Thugged Out and Ill Will
It's all real, what the deal?
Yo, F' the nonsense, I got the reinforcements
To crush any enemy's offense with a 100,000 horsemen
The hardest motherfucker on the market, right here
I complete in a minute what will take you a light year
Extraterrestrial biological entities with infinite energy
Battling for world supremacy
Who wanna get touched? The Can-I-Bus will crush you
With hard jigsaw puzzles and strong jaw muscles
Ambushing MCs, jumping out the trees
Like Vietnamese in fatigues covered with leaves
Interrogating you wack MCs like MIBs in dark glasses
Asking you to tell me exactly where that alien craft landed
By flashing bright lights in your eyes with them silver cameras
So when you revive, you can't recall or understand it
That's how the Canibus keeps tabs on the planet
I use amnesia to neutralize public panic
And take advantage of opportunities to do damage
I pierce your heart with evil thoughts
The only thing faster than the speed of light is the speed of dark
With the jaws of a great white shark, I rip you apart
My state of the art lyrical lasers is razor sharp
Splatter the brainmatter of my enemies
With the same bullet trajectory that murdered John Kennedy
In the back of his cranial cavity
Which is actually what happens to any MC for tryna battle me
Right there, uh

Check it out y'all
Check it out check it out check it out y'all
When I creep through niggas just see through just like a negligee
And ain't no talking 'cause ain't much that the dead can say
Long as I'm walking I'll be strapping my dog
Whacking the hogs, Desert Eagle packing the mugs
Metal slabs with yellow tags or 
What happens to those that chose to be foes
I bet his man knows but yo we only getting stronger
And the amount of time we're facing is only getting longer
Get the Mayor on the horn, top the shit to go down
Strap for the showdown, wet up your crib, kick your down
Know you scheming so I got to get you first
Put you right up in the brand new hearse, could be worse
You should have seen what I gave this nigga
Two vests couldn't save this nigga, the way I laid this nigga
Played this nigga but that's what I'm good at
Lay your niggas out fighting pits and busting hood rats
Where's my fucking hood at, I’m flip on niggas like switches
Rib all niggas like bitches, slip all in niggas in ditches
They ain't found half the bodies that a nigga caught or should I say a nigga bought
'Cause there's nothing like getting paid for a nigga sport
Kill for what a nigga thought but that's just how it be
And I know that one day they gon' try that with me
But just as long as I'm on top, you ain't stopping
And ain't the motherfuh dropping
Sat shorty down told him how much his peeps missed him boom! One shot blew his respiratory system
Kissed him goodnight, put him to bed
With four mo' to the head so I know he understood what I said
Red was all over the place, it didn't look good
But I did what a crook would, searched the crib and took goods
And every night, it's the stress
That makes me put another cat to rest, make another cat a mess

Ayo they scared to death, misery need company
These crab slackers, people actin' like they're Mad Rappers
Even with a record deal our guns still peal
Break a piece of your brain off, wipe the stain off
Throw the Range off, policiano watch for Hondo
They lookin' at our poster now, playing us closer now
The funds follow us, what, these chickens swallow us
And you wonder why they can't find us
Yo, Jose Luis smoke lah like the Reverend
Look in the crowds, cloud look like coke and heaven
Like whoever sittin' on pies too, he gettin' high too
Mad fly too, a thug too
Yo we praise those, however you make your pesos
Keep your sh' tight just like Jose Canseco's
Batting stance, a majorly we glance
And gotta yell "What, What!" 'cause thug people don't dance yo
I told people, that you did it for show
But niggas thought you was ill, yo, even your ho
Yo for real young blood, I'm really afraid so
Your color's got revealed and now you buy dough
I'm vastos, locos, morenos, go-golos, boriquas, platinos
My people rollin' those, fontos and hydros
We stay smokin' it, these light it up though, we stay smokin it Tone Loc'in it, me and Fat Joe still provoking it

For Hip-Hop heads I provide the ultimate high
Canibus is the difference between Harvard and DeVry
See I deliver lyrical blows to pose a potential threat
To any MCs I've ever met
Or will meet, I can't be defeated or beat
Lyrically I got more lines than streets
So if you got beef, you better speak now or forever hold your peace
'Cause I'm coming from the stomach of the beast
Representing the East Coast from border to border
I'll battle this whole planet in alphabetical order
From A to Z or whatever the case be
My brainwaves beat against the rocks like the sea
See my style is every color in the spectrum
Your style is plain like trains without vandalism
Steady blinding niggas when I be shining
Holding the Sun in my hand, I walk across the horizon
My I.Q. number has six zeros behind it
I possess the power to sleep with open eyelids
On a metaphysical level
I'll make you burst into flames just by looking at a picture of you
In fact, whenever I put the match to the buddha
My brain cells become parallel to a computer
Gathering thoughts at speeds that light couldn't exceed
Test scores the Japanese overseas can't believe
When I'm around other MCs I don't know how to behave
I feel like a metal plate in a microwave
Taking niggas beyond the lyrical speed limit
Digging graves and dumping bodies in it when I'm finished
Attracting shit like a musical magnet
I'll freak flows in binary codes and talk to faxes
Lifting weights and taking amino acids
Sprinting through marathons like they was sixty yard dashes
My reactions’ll hit you, before your proactions hit me
Think about it, it’s deep
My fan club got more followers than the Grateful Dead groupies
And my SAT scores got aliens trying to recruit me
’Cause lyrically I got superhuman abilities
And I’ll make a mockery of anybody for drilling me
I get mad respect in this rap game
MCs like you can only call me by my last name
You came out of a woman’s womb
I came out of a space pod, I’m a alien, a lyrical god
You gotta find 20 niggas like God just to even the odds with me
My philosophies are iller than Socrates
I’ll damage your physical with my verbal
My balance enables me to square dance in a circle
To me you’re like a nigga tryna jump a normal nigga's hurdle
And word to my unborn child, I’ll hurt you
Experiment on you like a mad scientist
And if my lyrics drive you crazy my fist'll be your psychiatrist
Like that y'all, DMX where you at yo?

Where you at yo where my dog got it i'm right here dog
I'm right here all right my  can i bust right right right holding you down
All right check it out yo check it check it check it out y'all know get
Back out check it check it check it out y'all

Look in the mirror say my name five times
Turn out the lights and nano took nine lives
Don't get scared now  finish it cuz you started it
Watch they grow out of control now you want no part of it
 when you're harder tell me what you made of
Already lost the stripe cause i know what you're afraid of
We both know you puss but ain't gonna say nothing
Just hit a  off and you can stay frontin
I got your back for now till i case the joint
Plus give the feds a real good place to point you lace the joint
I ain't gonna front i had my hands full
Glad to be alive but you like that's that bull
But now you know what you get when you fucking with
Something you should've left alone that you stuck in
Ducking till that headpiece gets blazed
Screaming this ah cease to the grave
It's over at least for you it is
It'll take a coronor to see how true it
Is I knew these kids but that didn't stop me from getting screaming
It was all for the money while i'm hitting him
Splitting him down from his nose to his nuts
Fire department come and put the hose to his guts
Washed away just like dirt when it rains
And now because of you i hurt when it rains

Yeah yeah yeah yeah yo if you live you remember ain't 85 when it was just bats
And knives made men were made wise dang stains seller Jetta caught the reigns sending slugs that a leader that ass
Crippled as the child had anemia without sickle
N.O.R.E. Nore grand marquis always
Wanted to be in this game since Biz Markie we light it up what it's like joe throw this talk up ever since crack came in
Little capsules we controlled blocks rock flat tops had two splats selling blue ties seeing Benny cock new rocks
 Ayo, I cock the cannon
Traveling to the top of the grand canyon we don't bone still instead yo i click get head then we hit the next state
And the next chick bed it's all fun to us when we in the tour bus politicking about which chickens we touch
Same routine same things happen in Queens seeing little chickens from the hood stripping in dreams was
Innocent once turned out to smoke blunts and up and still rock old fronts turned out no doubt all the stunts showed it
Around yeah we did it all while i was with the dogs traditional cause my yo my pops oh drugs you're impeccable like
Them yucking Chinese rugs still sexual bony bitches right in the club yo inadequate deep just like devil's advocate i bless
That seeing this shirt plus a guess at what Funk Flex the franchise baby get wise
98 take it over

RIght right right yo yo check it out like this yo
You think that you a tough guy I’ma show you I'm tougher (You got it)
Yeah like that y'all yeah
Right Canibus the lyrical analyst get on the phone , dial 911 and call an ambulance like this
Y'all like this y'all i'm bout to rip y'all yo yo you think that you a tough guy
I'ma show you I’m tough I i crushed her back this mother up molecular structure select the conductor make disaster
Strike like buster yo you might say why I’m a gun but yeah that's Jamaica for making the gun touch you triggers get
Pulled bullets to make your body parts rupture while you sit and wonder how I just took the life of another me or my brother
Jump in the jeep and burn rubber go to my mother's switch cars that was clever she said son i love you but they
Gonna handcuff you a cold war veteran they used to assemble weapons for the Kremlin discipline like Olympic gold medallist
Remember this, never ever check protection list 'cause nowadays what you can catch is very infectious unless you
Got a death wish and you wanna mess with women who poison the walls and they wounds and asbestos these tricks is treacherous listen to me when i tell you
This whatever you trying to buy somebody is selling it somewhere somehow you get gunned down when the guns go blab just cause you was
Running your mouth
All my niggas in the background saying no doubt
You a faggot nigga stop fronting to put the gap down kick a rap
Now let me see if you can freestyle throw in the dat now let me show you how to black out

I start living foul like pork
Shutting down underground streets of New York Hawk is what the niggas call me cause they all
Be sucking my and on my  uh puss keep it running from the werewolf (Howl!) howling at the moon on the roof
No get them 10 niggas on them hope god's with them give me the back let me split them i
Have them where the pillow and the casket won't fit him only reason i did him he wouldn't fight back trying to strike back left him
Like that laying up with the white hat getting right back gotcha when i snatch her up off the grave nothing but bones and
Ashes hitting niggas with gashes to the head straight to the white meat but the streets stay red bitches don't
Get me head for free cause they see who i'mma be by like 2003 that nigga D took it there oh you thought it was a
Joke he ran through like 20 g's you thought that i was broke stupid that's what you get for thinking and
Eventually found that's what you get for stinking blowing up the spot when you rot plus if it gets hot they'll know you dead for
Four square blocks hit them with the ice to the grill kill nigga kill yet and still they don't
Know i'm a robber that dog DMX is a muhfuckin problem

Yeah yeah yeah hey
Yo, I grew up like the regular thug, sold drugs
Wasn't proud about it, but that's just what I gotta do
I copped the Jordans and the Filas too
Yo, I loved the Bo Jacksons, the orange and blue
Used to snatch Lee patches, now I wear Cartier glasses
Thinking that the earth axis
Revolves around my will and how the fuck I feel
Yo, I played ball for Vince, yo, I handled the pill
Then it dawned on me, came strong on me
I belonged with these niggas thuggin' with me
So I switched crews, started rolling with the older dudes
Drinking brews, did what they say, then paid dues
My hands dirty, tryna keep little Leah
And got jerked the first time I tried to re-up
People my age tried to say slow my speed up
'Cause I smoke bogies, stay throwing weed up
I used to run with rob Crawford troy outlaw Freddie bear rock and joe wu vernon and timbo shandung ass shot soon
Section 2 part of Iraq i grew up at had to learn how to slap box instead of begat i never knew rap
All i knew was crack yo was rules to this game and people to blame when you see another little brother
Doing the same yo flex what you doing over there baby all right i'm past that pass that calm
Down  yeah yeah yeah yeah yo yeah
Yo like this y'all on some real mc ish yo yo yo
Yo i'm a nuclear warhead right now you're provoking my detonation never test me without proper
Authorization my lack of patience caused me to get mad and exploding for your mother like an airbag your  is
Fake your brain is child's play to manipulate i create lyrics too intricate to imitate moving at the velocity let it break your
Stopwatch if you clock at me my concrete jungle is like jumanji but iller than whatyou seen in a cinema
A five foot eight  with more horsepower than 12 cylinders my brain consists of twin pentium chips double
The clock speeds of a 586 nothing about my physical matrix is basic i kick flavor beyond what your
Tongue is capable of tasting you'll be so surprised you won't believe your own eyes it's like a jamaican see in the snow for the first time rhymes of
A sort that distorts space and time it's like explaining color to a man that was born blind one of a kind i got divine
Chromosomes in me my sperms scrambled their eggs in a woman's ovaries cause i'm as original as it gets and i
Can't respect  to copy like double decks i get vexed when crab  bite my style cause i'm selling a thousand
Records per day per square mile breaking the laws of physics with metaphors and lyrics talking to dead poets by conjuring up
Their spirits from Shakespeare to Edgar Allen yo the whole Deadpool society couldn't mess around with the
Talent much less understand it i make typo walkers that the circus lose they balance when i kick the planet
Right across it on the woolly mammoth dmx in the background with the hardcore sound from the
Underground with funk flex he got the shotgun pump i got the check blow him out DMX blow him out
Check it check it certain we'll have a  hurting the dirt you will get you in the dirt
We're demands  kids don't play i'm too old for the joke she'll get smoked i don't play it won't say what's going to happen if
You force my hand but someone somewhere would be like i lost my man take it to heart it's about to get dark
So run that all that  y'all  talking been there done that what black fingers to act let me know
But he like what i'm saying so shut up and let me go yo you think it's a game keep playing they gonna find your ass
Somewhere in the creek land it's over you just ain't laid down yet and then the minute you're gonna be that
That they found you hold on for making movies and make moves and stop talking about that you can't prove I’m the mountain
You can't move so why you trying looking at me stupid wondering why you died why you flying
Through the air with a big ass hole in your chest wishing you was pulling the best but it's too late for wishes or you
Getting this rest go to sleep papa will take care of the stress god bless him may he have mercy

That's why i behave so cold before i start the flow think it's important you know nuclear payload will probably blow up the whole
Globe spreading my wisdom reaching across solar systems touching galaxies and the living creatures within them
From the creators of the exorcist the bone chilling lyrics i'm revealing the academy award winning i touch all men
And all women regardless of their religion as long as they got a law in them my vision be that of the ball eagle
Not the pigeon for 200 yards i strike a victim with precision for anyone who's ever questioned my poetic position i
Want you to concentrate and listen you must take a seat at the periodic table and taste the elements in order to
Accelerate development let me explain channel the powers of your brain drink a cup of your own chairs to be immune to the pain repeat after me
Rhonda while i show t not send 20 to the address on the back of my cd allow six to eight weeks for delivery of
A kitten to turn you into a real emcee just like me like that y'all dmx where you at y'all
Like that once again it's the darker  here to spark a  break apart that 
Cause the guard is bigger under stress so unless you want to get blessed to the chest with slugs from the smith and west rest all the pump up would have hurt all
The  dumpsters defeated dirt on the  my hands stay dirty cause i played dirty to my way
What you don't know find out the hard way her  job is never done i handle my business had come
And it's never been a one-on-one or has it been a problem because i deserve them like salt lock it up like a bar whenever wreck is caught and it's my fault i keep

Peeps and hold down the foot never get caught cause i creeps when i crawl leaving  sprawled out after i smoke him i slit his throat dick in the
Mud and let his blood choke him off and off  get the pigs stuck up in them and in the streets chickens get
Stuck up in them my ammo this man slaughter kid cause on the rails i don't wet a  the water dead
Sled because i got to slide when the dirt is done a homicide but they want me on the murder one but as long as i got
My gun i'm alright stay out of sight while it's light and then come out at night to make moves again stop the bruise
Again i know i'm going to hell because i choose to sin all my life i've been the devil's advocate mad  never even knew the
Devil had a kid but he does and when you hit a buzz at a chainsaw he'll know what i spilled
Yeah yeah yeah

Pinch myself to wake up, 'cause I know it's a dream
Niggas that don't know me see me and think I'ma rob 'em
Niggas that know me well see me and think I'm a problem
I'm just a nigga that's misunderstood
But word to mans, I'll turn your last name to Underwood
'Cause if I see it, I'ma take it and run with it, that's me
What type of bullshit is this nigga on? That's D
The darker it gets outside, the more blood flows

Gun blows, bullets whistle, wouldn't miss you
Hit you all up in your mouth like it tried to kiss you

Trick that cycles use knowing that anything might light your fuse your best bet is to stay as far away from me as you

Like please stop them from killing the other one like kill them all get them all do it today and that thing that we use my other half
Threw it away introduced to a personality i never knew existed you think that last one was bad this nigga's twisted so that's four
Souls trapped in one shell which means many more souls trapped in one hell slapped in one cell but not for long
Because ssi contest for my the repeat and less than five i'm back on the streets same four  stop taking the
Medication now i'm laying 
Yo i aspire to kick the fattest  you've ever witnessed from a far side that's even confusing the fat lip
Rhymes designed from lines of pure knowledge i make your head nod to your neck runs out of cartilage i think it's obvious that i could bring
The ruckus scream on your crew like a military drill instructor when i come through  stand still in the
Statues if i have to i battle your whole rap crew then i'll attack you with words that's absurd and rip your goddamn skin off
Just to get on your nerves distortion my brain waves communicate with Martians my fantastic four four
Firepower's awesome no man alive can survive my lyrical army i don't care if you got nine lives or five heartbeats i
Generate volts like electric ills cause i be sparking it like plugs in automobiles and i'm so for real with my
Lyrical skill mentally ill in the brain like cypress hill don't try to sneak attack i never sleep in black i do 360's with my head
When i watch my own back and you should have known that  was there from the start i beat you more times a minute than a healthy heart
Rolling deep with  by the car loads and land cruises and  sixty thousand dollar autos i step
Through your club like a portal and bag all the  because i got more lines than barcodes
Like that y'all where you're at dmx y'all when my dog oh hold on i  that yeah oh no me
No you know it yeah
And you see they got pop word on my life word on my click all the person really got in this life is his wordness
And i stay true to them like both of them lost people talk i click knock writing them doors yo they
Hate me cause they broke and can't floss yo i cop coat cook it up everybody cooked already like a 98.6 why y'all
Like a Chevy you're floss now look how much my juice costs now i'm realizing that you hate me so i hate y'all too
From both sides it's hate so it's mutual beautiful my guns make it suitable shoot at you
Just like statue you know my name nori what what DMX wreck uh

I'ma cat that sit back and look at shit
'cause crooked shit gets me amped
And what you don't know, will get you rocked in Sleepaway Camp
Grand champ and raise more hell, than a Sorrel
See you at the peephole, bustin' at the doorbell
Though I wasn't coming without mine
You put me on the front line because you doubt mine
Bet your and lost yours, you come to get your I tossed yours
And it cost yours, fuck y'all niggas stupid, I'm the boss dog
What more dirt must I do, plus my crew
Busts at you, and you be like "What's that oooh"
Bust that Clue, do I bring the noise what
Destroy these mutts, is these niggas toys or what
Bring all the pretty niggas thinking they gritty, in one city
Lemme show them niggas shitty some pity, but for fifty
A motherfucker will get a bullet to hum to him, put the gun to him
Hit 'em with something that comes to him, bet it runs through him
Look at what I done to him, no more smiles
Got the whole top half of his head, running wild
But you don't hear me though, so I turn out the lights
We can take it to the streets dog, turn off the mics
If you want war, then you want more, than you can stand
And this 44, will leave you with your dick in the sand
Who the man, and now you cats know for real
Get at me dog, (bark), what the deal

Ain't no secret but how is going down when stop put on the pressure
It ain't nothing but another  put on a stretcher with the blanket over his face take him to the morgue with the waist cause he
Was in the wrong place at the wrong time so i gave it to him and his chest and his throat and his head and his back do his vest
Yes ain't a whole lot to breaking a  down fast and call me black cause that's how i'm gonna be on that ass
Y'all   think it's sweet but ain't no thing going down until i eat so killing beef you better why you still got teeth
Cause they bout to get knocked out hopped out on that ass with a blast made yo  drop out cop down to where you know what cause you know why you know my
Mother name up in this game and  you know i will never be caught slipping but on some east coast turns New York 
Don't I swear perm to keep  sleeping with the worst sermons bad for the environment put them in early
Clue yeah right slow it down a little son
We're gonna do a cloak all right yo check it out like this y'all yo
Yo yo yo I speaking frequency thoughts why i have trouble hearing cannabis is the lyrical version of German
Engineering yo check it out like this yo yo yo i speak speaking frequencies dogs why
I have trouble hearing cannabis is the lyrical version of German engineering raw metaphors keep
You high for much i can fly around the earth twice but I refuel it once work it out yo speed that up a little
Some flex got my thing going right now yeah check it out y'all yo I splattered
Your brain matter the Quick Draw McGraw jaw tapper my lyrics hit harder than pissed off line backers so exercise
Caution I shattered yours like porcelain mess around and get your life span shorter cause i'm the ultimate evil
Terrorizing people I handcuff your neck to a moving vehicle then i put your block scene on lock like a swat team
Cause I’m totally four pound blocks with infrared beams it seems so stupid that you wanna battle us but we know rhymes like Einstein knows
Calculus so don't be doubting my  cause i'm the cannabis and i got more lines than Amelia K
Swiss without a question without a shadow of a doubt i kill a last dragon and drink the last dragon style
 running off with the mouth but they're just cowards afraid of my powers how many  pussing their trousers

Yo, New Orleans, La, Va to Queens, I-95, where we never drive clean
But good, gotta get out the hood, to really make it, now we cake it
Until our whole team'll take it to another level, another Rolie wit
Another bezel, like war against God against another devil
Sustainin', now we're in Moschino, niggas say we changed it, switched it
Now it's Cristal, instead of Mistic, Jose, catch me wit a pigeon and
A gold biscuit, gettin mad lifted, let me find out,, they sellin dimes outEmbed
