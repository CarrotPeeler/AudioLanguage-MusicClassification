I got water for you when you went dry
I got good time when you get loathsome
I got Heaven before you die
I got all you need!
I got all you need!
And if you wanna have fun
Baby please make it to me!
I got heat for you, when you get cold, babe
I got air conditioning when you are warm
I got .. you get old, baby
I got protection, you get on
I got all you need
I got all you need
And if you wanna have fun
Baby please make it to me!
I got rhythm when you wanna dance, babe
I got a tailor when you need some clothes
I got love for you when you're getting...
I got money when you are broke!
I got all you need
I got all you need
And if you wanna have fun
Baby please make it to me!
I got all you need
I got all you need
I got all you need
And if you wanna have fun
Baby please make it to me!See Joe Bonamassa LiveGet tickets as low as $19You might also likeEmbed
