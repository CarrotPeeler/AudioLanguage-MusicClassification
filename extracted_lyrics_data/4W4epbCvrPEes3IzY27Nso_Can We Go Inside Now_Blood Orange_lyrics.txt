7 ContributorsCan We Go Inside Now? Lyrics
Oh, I was a lonely girl
I grew up fast
I took my Tahoe to go somewhere where the boys lust
I turned my phone off, I sold my laptop
And then I took right off to the west

Give me spring and sun, sleeping on the run
Bed is my backseat, twinkles what I eat
Mother made my dress full of my distress
Guess I'll miss the dance, ruined every chance

You know I was the queen
I kept my record clean
Approaching Whistletown
And reaching higher ground
I'm keeping grains of sand
I moisturize my hands
In case I need to do another shoot

Give me spring and sun, sleeping on the run
Bed is my backseat, twinkles what I eat
Mother made my dress full of my distress
Guess I'll miss the dance, ruined every chance

Oh, I was a lonely girl
I grew up fast
I took my Tahoe to go somewhere where the boys lust
I turned my phone off, I sold my laptop
Then I took right off to the west

Give me spring and sun, sleeping on the run
Bed is my backseat, twinkles what I eat
Mother made my dress full of my distress
Guess I'll miss the dance, ruined every chance3Embed
