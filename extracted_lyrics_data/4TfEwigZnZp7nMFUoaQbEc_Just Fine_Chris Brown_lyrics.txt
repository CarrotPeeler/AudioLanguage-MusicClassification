12 ContributorsJust Fine Lyrics
Hey, ha
Ooh, hey (Oh)
Oh, now, oh, now

We did everything we could do to try and make it work (We did, we did, babe)
Baby, you look so confused 'cause it feels like there was no way we could lose (No way, no way, babe)
Baby, I just don't know why I can't find the things you need in me (I can't, I can't, girl)

Baby, they know just what to say
They tryna break us away from one another
But maybe they're right for a change

I think God will give you someone (Ha)
Much better than me, trust me
Your eyes will be okay (Ha)
It will be alright
You'll be just fine
Just fine, just fine, I know that, baby

We would disagree constantly on the basic things (We did, we did, babe, mmm-mmm)
You thought that there was someone else all along (All along, no way, no way, babe)
Baby, I want to decide to stay right by your side (I can't, I can't, girl)

Just listen to me when I say (Oh)
