3 ContributorsRock and Roll Lullaby LyricsShe was just sixteen and all alone
When I came to be
So we grew up together
My mama child and me
Now things were bad
And she was scared
But whenever I would cry
She'd calm my fears and dry my tears
With that rock'n'roll lullaby
And she'd sing
Sha-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
It will be all right
Sha-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Let's just hold on tight
Sing it to me mama
My my my my mama
Sing it sweet and clear
Sing it sweet and clear
Oh, mama let me hear
That old rock'n'roll lullaby
Now we made it through the lonely days
But, Lord, the nights were long
And we'd dream of better mornin's
When mama sang a song
Now I can't recall the words at all
It don't make sense to try
'Cause I just knew lotsa love came through
In that rock and roll lullaby
You might also likeAnd she'd sing
Sha-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na
It'll be all right
Sha-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na
Now just hold on tight
I can hear ya, mama
My, my, my, my mama
Nothin' moves (heals) my soul
Like the sound of the good old
Rock and roll lullabyEmbed
