8 ContributorsBabylon Burner Lyrics
Yo
Eskiboy, Roll Deep
You know me, listen
You know me, listen!
Big achiever, E2 weaver
Had the first SEGA
Yeah I emerged out of Jungle Fever
Volume one creeper
Roman street sweeper
Don't get gash by the hour, rudeboy
I get gash by the meter
Wile-house senior
Lemon'll lean ya', E3 teacher
L-O-N preacher, UK speaker
Trinidad bloodline
East-side that's where I ride
I'm a leader
East London advertiser reader
Redwood blue-wood
I'm a light sleeper
Stepney Green geezer
Ain't had shisha
I know Caroline but I don't know Alisha
I don't really care if, either one of them
Done a thing with Josh Perry or Peter
My love for them's nowhere on the meter
You might also like
Yo
A mi name Riko dan
The London City warlord
Original loaded M16
Them too chatty mout
Me have a lot of clout
And dem say dem have gun for di war but me never see them back them up
And mi gun dem so big 
Wha dem a chat about?  What's dat about?
? spread rumour
Mek me put a bullet in your head like a tumour
Cancer 
But mi nah response ah
Mi's a old school gangster
Kick off your face

Dem know mi as di scarface mobster

Babylon, worse life
 show the war can't dun
That's why mi haffi walk with my one
Babylon boy fi stand out when we come around
Because you know they can't take me for the clone
Us man are road, yeah we are Roll Deep
We nuh have no time fi waste time pon street
Boom! Boom! Bare shot man a beat
Cah me is a man, we nah work with MP
Mi nuh like dem, so dem nuh like me
Music for life they can't take that from me
That nah go work, that nah go happen
Yeah fuck that, that a two words from me
 quickly
From you come round the ends and try chat fuckery
Mi's a man ah move evil pon Babylon boy dem
Skip the ripper are you stupid!
Ah! Ah! Ah! Yeah!
Done with the gun talk friend
What you know about nines and MAC 10s?
Fake MCs jammin' round the bend
Maybe your mother don't know how to load the skeng
Pricks, are you dreaming?
Only thing you're bussing is semen
Don't even stain the ceiling
You should be a mumma's boy
Hard to clean
You should be a good boy now you smoke green
When I run with the big boys
Play with the big toys
Big money are you ready for the big noise
Come fanatic, talk to the 'matic
Run round and make you flip back like an acrobatic
Spit like a semi
I can make you click like a stitch in the belly
Breeze is very coldhearted
Look what you gone and started
Step up in my face you'll get your face departed like

OK then!
You never expect to hear me on this one!
Shaysus!
Beware of, but don't be scared of brree!
Be straight up, be square with brree!
Who does a lot? I swear it's brree!
Ask one away  brree!
Look over there! There's a breh with the same hair as brree!
Don't bring your hair near brree!
I'll do a lot, I'll cut it off
On a level seriously
He can be a nightmare with brree!
No pussy gets spared with brree!
All the girls over there, they're with brree!
You can't feel it in the air like brree!
You wanna try fling a chair at brree!
End up hitting a girl next to me
And you feel like the wasteman after
Whilst we are crying with laughterEmbed
