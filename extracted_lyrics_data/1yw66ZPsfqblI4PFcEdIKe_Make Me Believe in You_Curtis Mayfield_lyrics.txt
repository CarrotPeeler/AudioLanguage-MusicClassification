3 ContributorsMake Me Believe in You Lyrics
Ain't a girl to be found
Without a mouth for BS-ing
You just remember I'm hip to the lip
Before you ask any questions
I ain't for no hard rappin'
So you can stop with your hot lips slappin'
It's gonna be, girl, a rotten shame
If I find that you're playin' in a game

Make me believe in you
Show me your love can be true
Do anything you want me to do
Make me believe in you

Keepin' filled with all your temptation
You know it leaves me with no inspiration
Another child playin' on me
May have a hard time succeedin', you see
You don't seem quite like the others
Respectin' me and your sisters and brothers
It would be awful, awful sad
To give love and you treat me so bad
You might also like
Make me believe in you
Show me your love can be true
Do anything you want me to do
Make me believe, make me believe in you

Ain't a girl to be found
Without a mouth for BS-ing
You just remember I'm hip to the lip
Before you ask any questions
I ain't for no hard rappin'
So you can cut out that hot lip slappin'
Gonna be awful, awful sad
To give love and you treat it so bad

Make me believe in you
Show me your love can be true
Do anything you want me to do
Just make me believe
Make me believe
Make me believeEmbed
