6 ContributorsAngelou Lyrics
Yeah, yeah

Oh Angelou, oh Angelou
Angelou, oh Angelou
Oh Angelou, Angelou
Oh my Angelou (One more time)
Angelou, oh Angelou
Angelou, oh my Angelou
Oh Angelou, Angelou
Oh my Angelou

In the month of May
In the city of Paris
In the month of May
In the city of Paris
And I heard the bells ringing
And I heard the bells ringing
In the month of May
And I called out your name
In the city of Paris

In the month of May
In the city of Paris
Oh, in the month of May
In the city of Paris
You might also like
Angelou, Angelou
Angelou, oh my Angelou
Angelou, oh my Angelou
Can you hear me? (Yeah, shh)

Just walkin' on a city street
Who would think you could ever be touched
By a total stranger?
Oh, not me
But when you come up to me that day
And I listened to your story
Heh, it reminded me so much of myself (Huh)
And I listened to you
It wasn't what you said
It was just the way it felt to me
As I listened to your story
About a search and a journey
Somewhere inside, hey hey hey hey hey hey, hey
It's just like mine
And she said

Will you be my baby?
Will you be my baby?
Will, will you be my baby?
Will you be my baby now?
Will you be my baby?
Will you be my baby?
Angelou, oh Angelou
Angelou, oh Angelou
Yes, yes I will
Yes I will, yes I will

And you'll, and you'll be mine, baby
And you'll be mine, baby (Shh)
Said yeah, I got a story too
Oh, and my story, it got no words
It goes something like this
Unnh
Yeah
Angelou
Angel
Angelou
