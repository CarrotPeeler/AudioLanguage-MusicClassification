10 ContributorsAu Cinéma Lyrics
Sometimes when you're Zorg, mm
And I'm your Betty Blue
And we're singing it close
Like the girls in "Bellville Rendez-vous"
I wish that we could somehow freeze the frame
But this isn't the silver screen, no

There's no pause
No rewind

Time to find out where the story goes
Sat hip-to-hip with the curtains closed
Watching ourselves au cinéma
Take our positions as the cameras roll
You'll be the guy, I'll be the girl
Watching ourselves au cinéma, cinéma

Now we cut to the girl alone
She's found on the Brooklyn Bridge
And she's truly at home, home
Her step has a whole new spring
Big bright lights of the city are shining for her
There's a thirst in her eyes and her heart
Though she thinks to look back, back
She won't
You might also like
There's no pause
No rewind
No pause
No rewind

Time to find out where the story goes (Where the story goes)
Sat hip-to-hip with the curtains closed (With the curtains closed)
Watching ourselves au cinéma
Take our positions as the cameras roll (As the cameras roll)
You'll be the guy, I'll be the girl (I'll be the girl)
Watching ourselves au cinéma, cinéma
Time to find out where the story goes
Sat hip-to-hip with the curtains closed
Watching ourselves au cinéma (Au cinéma)
Take our positions as the cameras roll (As the cameras roll)
You'll be the guy, I'll be the girl (I'll be the girl)
Watching ourselves au cinéma (Au cinéma), cinéma

Where the story goes
With the curtains closed
(Watching ourselves au cinéma)
Watching ourselves au cinéma
Take our positions as the cameras roll (When the cameras roll)
You'll be the guy, I'll be the girl (I'll be the girl)
Watching ourselves au cinéma, cinéma
Take our positions as the cameras roll
You'll be the guy, I'll be the girl
Watching ourselves au cinéma3Embed
