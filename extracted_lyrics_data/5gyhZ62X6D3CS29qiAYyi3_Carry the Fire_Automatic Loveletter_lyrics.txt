2 ContributorsCarry the Fire LyricsIf this is all I have to give
These written words exposing within
And everyone has a secret or sin
Then why do I feel all alone in the end?
My fists are clenched in cold
My fists unclench to hold
I carry the fire
I carry it home
I lead the lighter until the breaking of dawn
To cover our mistakes
The sun will shine on
I'll carry you with me
And we'll carry on
Carry on
So don't let it show
From the underwear under your clothes
Don't tell your mother that you're running low
Don't confess to your father that you don't know
My fists are clenched in cold
Well my fists unclench to hold
I carry the fire
I carry it home
I lead the way lighter until the breaking of dawn
To cover our mistakes
The sun will shine on
I'll carry you with me
And we'll carry on
Carry on

Keep carrying on
Keep carrying on
Because my fists are clenched
I carry the fire
I carry it home
I lead the way lighter until the breaking of dawn
I carry the fire
I carry it home
I lead the way lighter until the breaking of dawn
And cover our mistakes
The sun will shine on
I'll carry you with me
And we'll carry on
Keep carrying onEmbed
