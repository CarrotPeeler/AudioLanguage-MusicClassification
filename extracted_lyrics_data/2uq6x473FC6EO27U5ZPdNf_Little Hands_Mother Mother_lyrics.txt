8 ContributorsLittle Hands Lyrics
My baby's gone like a flame
Put out by the rain, water down the drain
Little face, little feet, little hands in my mind
Where I'm crying all the time, where I'm crying all the time

Little face, little feet, little hands in my brain
Driving me insane, driving me insane
Little face, little feet, little hands not around
No more little sounds, no more little sound

My baby's gone like a flame
Put out by the rain, water down the drain

Ah-ah ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah ha-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah ha-ah-ah-ahSee Mother Mother LiveGet tickets as low as $28You might also like2Embed
