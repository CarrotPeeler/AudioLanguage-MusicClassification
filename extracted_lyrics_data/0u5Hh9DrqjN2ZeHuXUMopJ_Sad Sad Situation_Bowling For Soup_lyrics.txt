3 ContributorsSad Sad Situation Lyrics
All right, this is "Sad, Sad, Situation"
One...
Two...
Three!

Hitched a ride, I was so messed up
But I sure was glad to meet you
You took my heart like they towed my car
And they're both still broken-down

Oh well, it looked pretty good on paper
And I've come to find out later that you're insane

Turn me off, I've had enough
I'm better off without anyone
I was wrong, maybe you should stay away

You came to stay 'cause they were painting your house
And you're still here six months later
You spent my money on god knows what
But it sure did cost a lot

Well, it's a sad, sad situation
Now I need a goddamn vacation, 'cause you're insane

Turn me off, I've had enough
I'm better off without anyone
I was wrong, maybe you should stay away

I'm self-absorbed (self-absorbed)
And shallow too (he's shallow too)
And all I wanted was to sleep with you
A basket case with a pretty face
And I can't take this shit no more, anymore

Turn me off, I've had enough
I'm better off without anyone
I was wrong, maybe you should stay
Turn me off, I've had enough
I'm better off without anyone
I was wrong, maybe you should stay away

Away
