3 ContributorsHelp Me LyricsYou got to help me, now; I can't do it all by myself
You got to help me, now; I can't do it all by myself
You know if you don't help me, darling, I'll have to find myself somebody else
I my have to wash, I may have to sew, I may have to cook. I might mop the floor; but you help me, baby
If you don't help me, darling, I'll have to find somebody else
When I walk, you walk with me; and when I talk, you talk with me
Oh, baby, I can't do it all by myself
Bring my nightshirt; put your mornin' gown
Bring my nightshirt; put your mornin' gown
You know if you don't help me, darling, I'll have to find myself somebody else"
You're talking about your woman, I wish to God man that you could see mine
