Baby kei hong tai sen ken
Na aang sung mah om nuam pen ing
I want you in my life
I don't wanna spend alone
I don't wanna be alone
So I'm putting my feelings in these songs
I cry myself again tonight
I don't wanna see you leave my side

Back up in my feelings when it's burning to the roach
I fall in love too quickly I should change the way I approach
Maybe I'm too different from these other dudes
Or maybe that's just how it's like to be another dude
I'm just falling but I'm never tripping over love
I'm always in the kitchen Gordan Ramsey on the stove
I'll try to be a rainbow in your gloomy clouds abovе
Not volcanoes but your body hotter than the stovе
Time is value so don't make it go to waste
I never signed up for a competition, not a race
If I'm not your only one I'm dipping right away
If u looking for relationships I ain't here to stay
I got goals I'm trynna reach so don’t be in my way
Always money on my mind I'm not the one to play
Searching for commitment cuz das the only way
I might be broke right now but I got brighter days
You might also like
Baby kei hong tai sen ken
Na aang sung mah om nuam pen ing
I want you in my life
I don't wanna spend alone
I don't wanna be alone
So I'm putting my feelings in these songs
I cry myself again tonight
I don't wanna see you leave my side

Wait, Take a minute Let me think this through
We’re, in the moment makes me wanna do things I wouldn’t do
Im just trynna make you mine, boo
You know I’m here cause of you
Wait, what chu say? are you scared?
What you mean, we got future all alone?
Run it back why you saying that?
In the future don’t you see us all alone?
I thought this was our plan all along
Whats this promises we can’t keep?
Our love falls in way too steep
I can see you're thinking Don’t think way too much
Promise we won't be regretting, am I not enough?
Why you second-guessing What's the hold-up
Love is blinding trust me as I trust you
Noticed that you’re terrified
This is the beginning want you in my life
For you, sickest rhyme is what I write
I put crophone in the mic
I think its time for you tell me out your mind
That you want me and don’t lie
I know you so well don’t try to hide
All Your feeling for me in disguise
Mines been passing through the sky
I don’t wanna be alone
Hit this tree and I'll be gone
The day feels so damn long
Without you, I'm just lost

Baby kei hong tai sen ken
Na aang sung mah om nuam pen ing
I want you in my life
I don't wanna spend alone
I don't wanna be alone
So I'm putting my feelings in these songs
I cry myself again tonight
I don't wanna see you leave my side1Embed
