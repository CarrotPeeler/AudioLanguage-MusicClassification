20 ContributorsSiberian Kiss LyricsGive me back my pictures of me
Me, you, and him that makes three
It figures the wheezing will measure your rate of depression
And I hope that you know
Like a bitch in heat, I hope she knows
So put another penny in and turn the crank
Until the frames cease to move
And the movie turns into a photo
A photo the size of a kiss, I hope she knows
Staring at this Parisian sex flick
Where the characters don't meet, the characters don't speak
And the characters are like mirrors facing mirrors:
Space always expanding
So put another coin in and turn the crank
Until the frames cease to move
And the movie turns into a photo
A photo the size of my fist, I hope she knows
A hiccup in paradise
I keep you jealously to myself
In photos the size of a kiss
A kiss in the shape of a bullet
On phone lines and letterhead
I'm dying about, I'm dying about
On phone lines and letterhead
I'm dying about, I'm dying about
You might also likeI've watched you whore yourself for one more thing
Why don't you sell yourself for one more?
There's always one more thing, why don't you sell yourself?
If I can't have you, no one will
Pushing a lover to love another
Are you turned on?
Are you turned on?
Pushing a lover to love another
Are you turned on?
Are you turned on?
A hiccup in paradise
I keep you jealously to myself
In a photo the size of a kiss
A kiss in the shape of a bullet
On phone lines and letterhead
I'm dying about, I'm dying about
On phone lines and letterhead
I'm dying about, I'm dying about
A hiccup in paradise
I keep you jealously to myself
In a photo the size of a kiss
A kiss in the shape of a bullet
I keep you jealously to myself
I keep you jealously to myself
I keep you jealously to myself
I keep you jealously to myself
A kiss in the shape of a bullet3Embed
