8 ContributorsLoaded Lux vs. Rum Nitty Lyrics
What's up Red?
What you got on my 40 homie?
This for my niggas up north on that jack Mac
First Smack back, we got a nigga to back smack
Naaah, this the nigga that smack back with the bum payments, slum wages
Lookin' at you yesterday I bet your safe haven a weigh station
Prolly why you was talkin' to me all dirty in them Spaces
Clean house
I'ma take y'all (k)night and shine him, I'ma wash y'all little shootin' stars in front of a son (sun) bathin'
And I'ma bake him
But I'm cold, for this cream, everything go in an ice box
Soon as I got the scoop it was Rum Raisin (raisin')
Nitty got a gun
Oh shoot
Just don't hit the messenger
I'm in the building whether you elevate or (elevator) step it up I'm the ceilin'
A body turned blue got sealed in
With yellow tape, stretchin', plus death inchin' up
Sent to me to (centimeter) to do a number on, that's a ruler, to whom he don't measure up
It's levels to the platform
Inform those you sound clever to
I set this up
I want action
Can he make the director's cut?
Well I'ma ask him
As soon as Jamie Foxx Show
Why you in here actin' like you really be gettin' Fancy?
Well I'm the main attraction
Why wouldn't he be extra, you regular
You a blue collar worker in here talkin' like you The Terminator
Nigga you was just at the register
Where Geechi at? I wanna speak to the manager!
Who makin' sure your drawer (you draw) right?
How was your Target practice
My bad, I messed that up
Can we take it from the T-Top?
Cause I heard Rambo here was in a Wal-Mart vest up front
Cash or credit sir?
People come from out of town, you price check 'em huh?
Who you gettin' loud with over the speaker for?
You soft, your  schedule tough
But this where you take that one time off
You was never a marksman
Your Life Eddie and Martin
I don't really see the bars, but how many times we gotta hear about the Gun Lines boss?
I'm cockin' back the hammer
I'm pullin' the trigger...on a scanner
That's the bar code
You should know the bar code
Rap how you roll
This what happens when they come for exposure and get exposed
You a shooter in battle rap
Not out there where the trap is at
I just want the people at home to have the facts
Now that we've established that
You just rap when your choppers chop
Don't let Geechi put that battery in your back to get cracked in ya copper top
You and JC ain't gonna do nothin' but get popped and lock
Cop a squat when the gang ride
All you gonna spin is a narrative, you ain't shot the block
I'm not ya op'
Them killers got real bodies under they belt
You ain't put nothin' away but them shopping carts in that Wal-Mart parking lot
Kai Cenat
You just chattin'
Stop the shit
I want your real life nigga, not the script, be descript (descriptive)
Them punches don't give us answers, River Dancer, you gon' have to kick it up a notch for this
What size of mitts that I'm shockin' him wit'?
If all Nitty do is punch, then battle rap as a sport for you might not be the pick
I should put him in a box, in (boxing) a fit
I'm top of the list
You done nit pick with the wrong one this time, get me?
You thinkin' this shit was gonna be all face masks and bubble baths
You the underclass punchin' bag, that's just a scab
Some will brag like you this big killer
18-wheeler
Yeah, cause when you go to deliver all that filler gettin' boxed up
How else you gonna stop, load it (Loaded)?
Man if you don't keep that shit truckin' past
This where we crush the gas
Without a CDL I'm a doctor doin' BBL, I'm in here cuttin' ass
Just for laughs
I ain't even lyrical
I'm a conscious nigga findin' out it's all spiritual
You a body, I'm just tryin' out material
The view aerial but I do burials
The fans can vote (devote) all they want
Eff the numbers, an Alien can't show God a new miracle (numerical)
It's hysterical
I baited him and he confirmed, didn't he?
I've been Loaded Lux since you sucked on big mama firm titty
And it's still my turn Nitty (maternity)
I burn cities
'Til you recognize the house back
You waited and got dated like a couple that went together in the 80's
He out matched
Harlem the town, ask about me
We battled on the block
Don't tell me nothin' about no App you up
This a natural born killer whaling (whale) on some farm raised tilapia
Cujo in the cage, latch is up
Back him up
All you is is big punches and haymakers
I'm that too plus the body work with the combinations
Your story got holes in it, I can see the spaces
Like a hockey mask
{Lux does the Jason music, while also sounding like he's laughing}
Cause every killer y'all thinkin' is next to me is not a Jason (adjacent)
No debatin'
Ain't no debatin'
Ain't no casualties to no pistols you firin'
Photo galleries when we picture you slidin', man
You know why they made this event private?
There's a difference between general raps and when the general raps, private
You sittin' by the guy that hire spirits
If I could spare it, they say sheriff the town without a sheriff
It's not a hearin' (hearing)
Listen, it's not snitchin'
But you stand to witness what I'm appearin'
The atmosphere get etheric
Lux a skydiving instructor
All that plain (plane) shit is out when I'm airin'
I gotta care for the modern era, it's a lotta errors
This why this Smack vet do errands
I done accessed new clearance (nuclear)
I gotta talk to a nigga like that bathroom mirror
These my sons, man
Looking up at the sun flarin' his eyes knowin' when alive he could never get near it
Just wear it
You know a Phoenix gotta die to rise, right Arizona?
So stop comparin'
Cause you don't know what state the God he in (guardian), that's apparent (a parent)
It's a brawl in Alabama, you gotta cheer (chair) up
So what we lost that Caffeine hype, nigga that's life
He dies, you showcase it, that's how it writes
Stop cryin' 'bout the lyrics let's dance
Somebody gotta move the body like Shakira
Pallbearer, I'm too advanced
Don't nobody care about Rum punches but ya drunk unc' at the cookout holdin' the red cup up
Bout to pour-
Got to switch up like some Michael Jackson skin
Before and after pics, you be blackin' but still pale in comparison
The nerve of you askin', "Who the culture got?"
Look here Robocop
You here to hold the spot
The fans is picturin' me and Hitman nigga, who this photo op', man?
They gon' post cropped ya top in the next debate
It's just another kid findin' out Santa Claus and wrestlin' fake man
But I believe the children are the future
Teach 'em well and let them lead the way
You might also like
{Lux impression}
"The spinal fracture back to do work like a chiropractor
My disc slippin'
Well let me realign you back into a time...when it was slim pickings on gym fitness, I hope you can dig it
Cause you up here takin' a risk (wrist) tryin' to make the cut
Well I got news (noose) for ya
They waitin' on the lines I kick the chair
Somebody should've told you to hang it up but I'm gonna give you this work and
You gon' do the job
I already told you nigga once
If you put me on the rooftop with Mr. Suicide, we already know who's finna jump"
I'm finna roll you niggas up
Y'all don't learn
'Til you at his funeral service cryin' out to God so hurt
Even the pastor gonna be choked up readin' Genesis 1; that's all first verse
I'ma kill him, and go to prison, do all my term
Get straight through that sentence like a highlighter, you can mark my words
Let me start my verse
Cause I ain't even heat up yet, the heat up next
Warning shot, let it fly over Loaded (overloaded) like Aaliyah jet
Show me respect
Cause I ain't one of these rookies from the Spaces
From 2013 I've been cookin' on these stages
How he looked at as the greatest?
Only come out one a year like a birthday candle
And I've been puttin' on for ages
You don't say shit
But let y'all tell it, "Beloved the GOAT", God tier, one of the top sellers
Escorted Deontay Wilder to the ring, we was all cheerin'
Next time a box will (boxer) get walked out by you will be a pallbearer
I saw killings
Pops gone, I got dead homies, I wish I could see my moms livin'
I'm God fearin'
Sometimes I talk to myself like, "Look at you emotional", cause I done really lost niggas
And all that I got left is to stare at they photo on the wall, the large picture
Let me talk witchu
They gave me one rule
"All that punchin' ain't gon' cut it. You gon' have to body Loaded with substance", like a drug mule
I got a ton, fool
Get murdered urgent, I'm sure you heard it
I said, "Body Loaded like a drug mule"
Cause you about to Get This Work in person
I'm never gon' play, not a second I waste
We can take this shit down to the wire, like electrical tape
Leave you brain dead, comatose, for several days
People askin', "Where 'Everything Healthy' at?" - in a vegetable state
I step with the greats, you can't tell me, "He's the GOAT"
This bitch gotta dress up and still can't hold it down, like Marilyn Monroe
This is ether
He only do that shit to get noticed, this bitch a diva
For his next (necks) bit- Dracula...you gotta listen cleaner
Next (necks) show- massage therapist, a tension (attention) seeker
My pen is cleaner
I've been through hella wars
PTSD keep me paranoid but I'm ready for it, we settle scores
You want smoke, tell a boy, we'll teleport
Pull up on the corner, like a TV dinner, but it's Healthy Choice
Peep the metaphor, I'm dead nice
I drop bombs you can't even connect, you can't compare types
That's the problem
People really confusin' shadow boxin' with air strikes
Don't you dare try, save that noise
I'm so serious I don't even gotta raise my voice
You gonna make me drop the gun and use the blade by choice
Knife Loaded, swipe Loaded, slay y'all boy
Slice Loaded, dice Loaded, I think I made my point
What's the chaos for?
I'ma embarrass him, then bury him
Glock, modified to a fully, we blitz areas
He had a Boost and then it was Crickets, it gets scarier
Sprints won't be mobile again cause we switch carriers
Jab!
You don't got lines like that, supportin' actor
Jab!
The GOAT got the poles (pose) in the air, it's a Jordan statue
Jab!
I'ma pill (peel) pop, that's the plan Beas' (Plan B), they goin' to be mourning (morning) after
Overhand!
I can picture Loaded in the Cloud like a storage backup
Backup, cause this ain't even ground
That one nigga you always keep around that be speakin' loud gon' catch a heated round
Then he get found
At the bottom of the ocean floor by reef Lux, (reflux) you better try to keep it down
What he about?
I met niggas, that got locked, hit the yard and became well killers
It's no help given
We talkin' 25 with an L, he killed the man in the cell and they gave him a braille written
That means they bumped it up to a death (deaf) sentence
What you gon' say?
Smack got me in 360 deals, not knowin'?
I'm battlin' little names gettin' little change that's why my lil' stock lowered?
I didn't put my Foot down that last time and you ran real Miles on us?
How lately Rum been gettin' watered down, but somehow I still got Loaded
Hit the crib, slide on him
Crash in with the goons, drag you to the room
Tie dawg (dog) up in front of the kids, it's an animal balloon
Them little bastards get it too
You gonna see them die in the flesh
So turn ya head, try not to look Loaded; sobriety test
And you followin' next
They finna lose you too
You laid up in a hospital, can't even move you through
They gotta feed you through tubes
He paralyzed, can only function in his mind like Ray's Boom Boom Room
The tools shoot through him, I had the gun smokin'
I can empty everything in the clip just in one motion
Unloaded, laid out, witcha blood flowin'
How the fuck is they gonna get the large picture, when you can' get up Loaded (uploaded)
You done Loaded
You can't keep it-
And  you just keep gettin' away with this shit
It's pure robbery
You wacker than a hit from a mob beat, this shit is ungodly
How can you put all that conviction into that fiction, like that man?
It's beyond me
It just don't hold my soul, it don't pump wit' the heartbeat
You can't talk down to real kings 'bout crowns wit' false teeth
Man brace (embrace) yaself, that don't make the cut
They think you sharp, me?
What I'm 'posed to draw from a nigga straight lyin' (line)
That's not a Harvey?
At best that's an erasable Sharpie
This a one on one you bring ya whole Family to the Feud
Son, Think Like A Man if you gon' be on top shinin', that's Steve with the baldy
But this how you come across
Peep
"Drive-by, never-ending cycle
Ghostrider on the Harley
The stick out, ketchup stains at an all white party
Get Out
Jordans peel (Peele) when I shoot, or the pick out
Questlove afro from The Roots"
Man, this what this shit 'bout?
Well here's some truth man
Rum, you tough like...I don't know
A man tryin' to get used to callin' his son "pretty"
That's all a one tricky pony he molded as a life for the wife and the young kitty
That want Disney
They come through the airport, see the billboards, we in the city
Of Orlando
They put you in the shack (Shaq) and told you to make Magic with that
He missed the point, and funny
This ain't never been a harder way (Hardaway) to get the little one Pennies
I knew you was gun silly, but this ain't the shot
What you forgot?
You took a whole 720 deal and thought
Cause your spending was doubling this was hustlin'
Bum Nitty, you gotta stop
Ya tumblin' man
The shit they makin' you go through, "Rum" gotta be short for "rummage"
Your name should be synonymous with a nigga who ain't got it
When every dollar spent you acknowledge him
Example, just go wit' me
Ehhhh, it may seem like a small thing but it's no Biggie man
I'm talking, you down to lint balls, pause, no Nitty
Y'all niggas be actin' real fucked up man, no Nitty
You talkin' way outta pocket youngin', no Nitty
It's been hard on the family lately, unc' broke down today, pause, no Nitty
Phoenix, these the type of players y'all got representin' the city
I'ma straight son (Sun) 'em
Cornell, you been corny
This the cornball, the big bunion
You been cold frontin'
For the win (wind), chill out, this nigga ain't gon' shoot the breeze
We didn't need no live stream discussion to see you behind a Drac' (Drake) is a big act (Ak), nigga please man
The creatives waitin'
They wanna see me talk about how you been stealin' my greatness
And taking from other creatives the natives forgot
You GrindTime, King Of The Dot stages to get the wages, I saw the plot
Wait man
First it was SONS, L.S.C., Writer's Bloque, Team Homi, E.F.B
All you missin' is the big boat or some waves kid
How many crews (cruise) you been on more than white women in their middle ages, man?
So called, trigger bracin'
Outlaw, drawin' on everything, then we found out the nigga tracin'
You copied the whole layout from young Blood
Blueprint on your maintenance
You're not an architect, you art collect, you robbin' just confiscatin'
No, you a con' for skatin', with a nigga whole demonstration
The hand gestures and the faces he makin'
You're A.I. generated
Android ass nigga, you imitatin', you emulatin'
You a mimic, straight simulation, I think you fakin'
Revelation
I saw how that battle with Donte went, the altercation
So when you sayin' the sticks is drummin', you just playin'
Oh you just bangin' for a plate then
How did I miss the cymbals (symbols)?
They gave you bands for Roc(k) and when it kick off you just basin'
You a stepper alright nigga
Twork ain't teach you nothin'?
Purses is the only thing you should be worryin' about clutchin'
Always talkin' this strap, nigga ya strapped for fundin'
You ain't gon' touch nothin' but ya ribs ya broke bitch, ya bluffin'
"The Alien gon' up it"
Fuck it let's get abducted
Off top, I put everything you build under construction, short stop
I'm a sure shot
You with a Loaded gunman, and went to punch it'
E.T.'s crash landin', 'bout to get his whole ship busted, I'm destructive
Cold blooded, when there's smoke, can't back out like the rear muffler
Ear hustler
Gotta muzzle it, it's car troublin', I put you on a flat bed in Harlem Hospital
Yeah I told 'em, we rumbling
This humblin'
When you got to bring a nigga down to Earth to ya higher intelligence, I be dumbin'
"It was all lookin' up like a space cadet"- 'til it wasn't
What you wanted?
Nigga this that one on one in the dungeon
You can't run to the crowd, you sold it
But ain't nothin' solid about the scripts you publish
I lift the cover
Line for line get laid flat, the fans can't pump it
You gonna run outta gas without some substance
Nigga, I'm layered like an onion, homeslice
Type, food for thought you ain't bred (bread) to break a piece of
I'm brick oven
Which of 'em?
They swear Rum could cook, but it's missin' lovin'
And I couldn't wait to see you like a distant cousin, nigga
Home front need structure
When the phone buzzin' 'til the ring
A fighter hear the bell, hop, up for the bag and it turn out to be luggage
Pack 'em up, your career's sufferin'
Nigga you ain't ballin', reality shows, Iman Shumpert
Nigga, shit used to be jumpin'
The Geechi put you on like a sweater
You can use Every Fuccin' Bar from your team
Danny Myers, JC, nigga ChatGPT, whoever
I'm like, "Whatever."
I'm too clever
Don't nobody splice it better, I've been nice forever
Ain't gonna be no cool run ins (Cool Runnings) with these youngins despite the era (error)
They bobsled teams, when it's time to slide they all gotta go right (write) together
Now they want to jump him, cause I'm big voiced
David Ruffin they English muffin
Pounds on 'em like a Brit', figures
He got all the tea but ain't gettin' to the crumpets
Nigga, you lunchin'
With your Five Guys on your side, punk you chicken with the nugget
Small fry, you little munchkin
Kermit The Frog lookin' muthafuckin' here with The Muppets
You E.F.B. niggas ain't gon' do nothin'
For you but stand in the background
Look at 'em, and blend in with the production
Smack gon' watch his server get wiped, the program ain't runnin'
It's no wonder
He ain't got trouble shootin' (troubleshooting), his chips are down
How can he even function?
Your bitch is funky, the kids is hungry
He on stage, all day, flippin' names, but can't flip no money
What happened?
Lincoln, Jackson, Jefferson, Grant, Benjamin Franklin
You didn't have nothin' for that?
Bum Nitty
Fuck ya soliloquys nigga
We all gotta work and pay village fees
I could care less about how much you dress like a 90's Wu-Tang member
He ain't no Killer B's (Beas')
Just cause Hitman passed him a little Chrome .22, I'ma get through him with ease (Eaz')
I'm to B.I.G. for these little C's (Lil' Ceas)
I'm mountain tall, they been countin' small
Rum out here lookin' like the last call for alcohol
Fake nigga, you gonna die broke in the casket
You a magician with a hat trick
You still got bunny ears out of all that tappin' nigga
It's a waste of my mothafuckin' time nigga
I think I can be the GOAT if I'm focused
I done gave y'all classic performances and so many moments
Against some of the coldest opponents
Truthfully I wanted to kill Mook first, cause bro just be trollin'
I would've overly smoked him
You would've seen me shoot a murder (Murda) on cam' like Brandon Lee, it wasn't even supposed to be Loaded
You know this shit over, you get what you give
You didn't even catch the double I just did when I said, "Murda on Cam"
But It Is What It Is, on my kids
He should stop tryin'
That old ass hoodie don't mean he cannot die
Fans cappin', really out here actin' like the grey matter but let me give you a piece of my mind
I'm top five, and I don't play 'bout my pay
I've been in situations just prayin' that we make it back safe
I done sent weight to each state, I done put work on the New York strip like Worcestershire sauce
I can't even say what's at stake (steak)
Life made me that way, but I'm no one's idle
I told my kids, "Do as I say. Not as I do
I won't misguide you or leave you lonely either."
It's black fathers leaving mothers every day, there's no denial
They ditch they sons, just hit and run like Holiday Heart but I broke the cycle
Loaded rifle
I up this bitch, 100 clip
Punishment, pummel shit, it spit fast like Pun and shit
No pun in this
Steal blowin'
Peel (pill) Loaded with iron, it's a supplement
I'm really from this shit
I know niggas that before they ride they get loaded and snort a line
Young niggas
And when the shorties slide they get the shortest time
Bein' they were fortified they're doin' four to five
They picked the homie up for the homicide he told 'em lies
They even had surveillance footage
He just prayin' they don't rewind it and find it there's more to find
I'm mortified
Tell this avid diva I'llpull up straight where he stay
In a mood for doom
My guns snug, I don't even think you can relate
He said, "it's evil to live backwards", that's some lame shit to say
Well I'll pop out the Civic holdin' the SKS at eye level, cause this could go the same either way
Hold up, you may get it late
I said, "pop", "Civic", "SKS", "eye" "level", they all go the same either way
I'm dangerous, don't play
This for my niggas in Hell
Waitin' on mail and ain't got they bail yet
Gettin' swole in the cell
Doin' full sets in jails (gels) like a nail tech
I know they felt that
You tryin' to escape the hood life still
To foot my bills it was fake prescriptions, they thought they had a good price deal
I got 'em, them ain't even the real OxyContin's
Smartie, they just look like pills
My dope, had the fiends feelin' it
They were stackin' cans for change, tryin' to get a refill of it
Some would donate blood, sell (cell) to the plasma center like screen mirroring
The streets serious
We try not to become what we seen
Battle rap saved a lot of lost niggas that was stuck in the streets
You created something elite
I was a student of Grey Hoodie Lux, I really studied his speech
He was the teacher, you don't gotta ask (Axe) if I was under the wing, it's no Secret
So watch as I turn up a Degree
From 902 to 903
You 'bout to see me hit my highest point, I'm a punchin' machine
You 'bout to get all the smoke
And take so many punches the fans yellin' (get off the rope!)
Tell V12 I murk niggas
Get rid of the body, put him in the dirt, he in the Earth missin'
The lookin' for him on the worst mission
Have you on the website for missin' persons
Puttin' V12 in the search engine
We work different
This your top 5 vet?
He not quite prep
I don't even get why you be sayin' 'Talk Dirty' when you ain't had a hot line (hotline) yet
How he the best?
I think cuz hella lame
I'm 'bout to put it all in your catcher's mitt, you say stuff hella strange
Straight up sellin' game
Tryin' to sound smart like, "It's in my molecules to get at 'em (atom)"
You make up everything
I don't ever play
When I heard I had Lux I had to rethink
Fans told me I needed to be in mean shape
Hit the mountain so I can breathe straight
Protein shakes, lean steak, show restraint for weeks straight
I told Daylyt, "I'm cook 'Everything Healthy' so much, he probably gon' need a cheat Day'"
Please play
I get to creepin' with this lil' Glock
Catch the two liters (leaders) in high altitude, now this ringin' in ya ears, Pop
Killshot
If you ever test me, you'd be dead already
I pull somethin' with a hairpin, it's light triggered, like epilepsy
I'm forever ready
You know your fam' don't rap and you man don't slack
Fuck Lux, he sent Pop back
Now he gon' have to stand on that
Rap

I'ma clip these niggas in all venues
This where war gets you
Remember before the battle I asked you for that Wal-Mart job application...cause I'm 'bout to mop the floor witchu
And if you kick the bucket, my shift continues
I'm chefin' a body, if you don't get the menu
Well it's perspective prolly
The levels I be leapin' you can't reach to perceive it with a weak Wi-Fi receiver if your mental connection foggy
Copy?
It might make the message choppy
Damn near top secret- tell everybody
You the pick that pushed me
Why wouldn't I get my lick back? pussy
Backpacker
Who couldn't get to the duffle bag
We from the original SMACK chapter, App rapper
You make me look wack to have to tell a chick I'm battlin' Rum Nitty, Hitman backup
And her ask me, "Who that?" after
The fact that you're not even a factor to tear through
But this what God tier do, nigga
Die for even havin' the thought, I dare (idea) you
Act like you don't know who the truth is
This is exclusive
It get abusive, I even tried hittin' Ozempic, I won't lose it
You confusing the me that went to preach and give a speech
I weeded out the sativa leaf to get relief
They 'bout to see the end of cuh' (Indica)
He in Hell (inhale)
But Heaven knows (nose) he in my house, I'm just makin' him the center piece
Disrespectin' the penmanship, there's penalties
You just rhymes nigga, technique, ability
My scribes describe, breach what's discrete, disguised
I should get metaphysics, physically
You finicky
I put symmetry to the imagery
I'm tryin' to draw the line- nigga I'm out front like a Widow's Peak
You don't know a producer this hungry, I ain't skip a beat
Slap the Mario coins out this lyin' nigga teeth to jog his memory
They lined you up to dry and I'ma ring him out like a Sonic the Hedgehog injury
He on bended knee
I don't care if you write (right) more than spellcheck, nigga
You goin' under the wing like El Chapo findin' out no bail set
The way you out here talkin' like a sales rep
You better be nice with them hands like a nail tech
I can smell threats, make it known
Rum, put the gin aside (genocide) it's 'bout to get worse than Israel did to Palestine
He think he home
Til I dock the, spaceship by the taxi spot
The Alien out here lookin' like an astronaut
And can't nobody on the stream defend it
I seen your business it seems offensive
To think he pimpin', lettin' people pump this
"He's all about the culture"
What y'all deem commitment is interestingly enough, just a means of interest
I mean (Amin) your new found Ace was hot for you, fever pitchin'
'Bout how you, be assisting all the victims that's dyin' to get in the game
Bleedin' the benches, is this what they bumpin'?
But I'm a "clench the series" type of nigga though
Why I care about who on the sideline suckin' they teeth is clenchin'
Just for mentions
This some bullshit you tryin' to make a play off (playoff)
And it's gonna be season endin'
It's not a game nigga
You back slidin' out on payments
Skippin' out on obligations
You wasn't thinkin' 'bout how that other league event went?
Fees, expenses, deeds unmentioned
Uhhh, how the fuck they couldn't keep you locked in?
You ain't never been in a key position
Co-star, you just felt free to mention
That Troy gotta screen intentions, Beas' a witness
You gotta show Chico the cheat code on the cheat sheets you gettin'
But keep forgettin'
They think you makin' offers
No nigga you takin' orders, we work different
You gotta ask, I tell Smack what I need per mission (permission)
Ebony know
Harlem over everything (h.o.e.)
You'se a hoe, nigga
Yeah I hear y'all connection Bluetooth
All the while you tryin' to air (ear) the plug; stoop stoop
That's why I know she the only big Hustle you knew was in a sleeping bag with your Yogi Bear aye Boo Boo
You'se a Goof Troop
She said you ain't shit, but good at eatin' ass like it's in the food group
Cuz, you even did it while she was a SuWoo
Chill gang
I'm still neutral to this new truth
'Bout how you can't even keep it real yourself
You out here rockin' fake Jordans with the cheesy tags, that's what you do
You're usual
And you beat for cash not from YouTube, I'm gon' whoop yo' ass
Live Pay-Per-View proof
Gettin' home delivered
Mr. turn hopes to shivers, broke his vision
It'll line you like you folded picture
You thought this shit was all pretty waters, flowin' rivers
I'll walk a nigga down, it's motion sickness
Road collision
I'll knock the cool out ya bop nigga
Buckle his whole agenda
Tonight, yo' bitch gon' talk to you like an older sister
In sober centers
Somebody get over here and tell Hustle to hold her liquor
Nigga, are you Insane?
Tellin' me how I got a game
Of power that empowers, I let down my guard and trust 'em
It was after the Aye Verb battle I looked at you, you started blushin'
Comin' up to me, tellin' me how much I influenced your becoming
Yada yada, somethin' somethin'
I wanna thank you so much Beloved
Then you get in here and talk like you walked up out of a coma all of a sudden
It's fresh concussions, I'm just adjustin'
Cause I'm no florist, but I saw it, how you gave me my flowers with hidden colors
It's what I read (red), cause who doesn't? (dozen)
Like don't say (Doce), you don't say? But on the subject
History shows a rose'll (Rosa) will get you parked (Park) for frontin', nigga bust (bus) it
I texted you, "bet", what you read? B.E.T. or somethin'?
Entertain me or not man
When the pride on a Crippy's shoulders was all chippy but he iffy
It's sticky, Loaded on a card like a Giphy, he picky
As the NFL on Draft Day
When there's money in it but he feel he (Philly)
Could lose to every Buck gettin' it
I saw it knock the fun out of Gilly
Your chances, is Cate Blanchett
But plant as if they Pun/Biggie, ya dumb skinny
Hip Hop Is Real
I thought me and Mook set the bar when we discussed Remy
Nah, y'all talked all this Rum Nitty then brung Henny
How much can he metal with my reign (rain), I don't let the rust get me
Sun City, gang member
At heart you a fun hippy
Lookin' like Lil' Smitty with the drug kitty
I know a E(ric) Holder when I see one, you shitty cuz, really
I said I was gonna beat the diarrhea down this nigga leg
Aw man that's enough to freak out like a drunk Diddy
You just props for the desktop
And the mobile screens
Keyboard warriors on the social feed
I don't believe
I know my team
This shit get thick we gon' shake like Ovaltine
Nigga I don't believe, you into all that
Your war batch more matched line for line, you know, call backs
You a hard back, these dog scraps
Like the nigga I whipped before you but aye, these are the Car Fax (facts)
I've never seen you in a picture without a hat
Nigga you all cap
With the bald patch
That's a bar gap
Beloved 3 in stores too
And I drop joints on you like Ong-Bak
I will battle anyone on the card with this hand of Jesus nigga
Don't you ever throw rocks at the sun
(You can't reach it)

Aye! You an outsider
They said he was better when he went by "Pop", niggas couldn't out rhyme him
He was really outside every 'bout fightin'
So fuck a costume, this bitch gotta go back to bein' "Pop" like Ms. Doubtfire
Let me talk to the vulture that was once considered a leader but then got Hollywood on us
You spent most of your career dodgin' the soldiers, not givin' shots to opponents
You got lost in the moment
That's the reason why Rex, ICE and niggas like Hollow is GOATed
You wasn't even a warrior on your own league like Arsonal showed it
On camera he put on this act cause the audience on him
Don't keep that same energy when he Offset knowin' you fathered the culture (Kulture)
You got absent on ya seed
But only to return when you seen what battle rap actually could be
You like that deadbeat father that came back around when his son got drafted to the league
Let Pastor Nitty preach
Open up a chapter
How many of us lost brothers have you actually tried to save in real life knowin' that we damaged?
When you battled Tsu Surf did you pull him to the side and give him some of that knowledge?
Or was it only for the camera?
You playin' with us, we know
You would've thought a Harlem nigga that was Paid In Full like Ace would've tried to save him from that RICO
But it's only for the Cam'
How are you not ashamed?
Out here callin' niggas "bad fathers" like it's all a game
And we never seen you in the same room wit' yo' son; Mama Payne
Dawg a lame
He all for fame
Be off the 'cane
A coat thief
Shall I proceed (pro seed)? Bronny James
You do a lot of sucka shit, disguised as other men
Are you a Farrakhan, Brother Polite or Charleston White?
Cause I (eye) was wonderin', I don't fuck wit' him
You can't lie to me
Actin' like you some pro black activist on your Panther tip that fight for peace
Why don't you jump in all black, fight police?
You wasn't protesting for George Floyd
Our people really in dire need (kneed)
Open your eyes and see, he's a snake in fact
You need your spirit healed, I'm tryin' to fix pop's soul (popped sole), like a VaporMax
I hate ya raps
You do a lot of random shit
Against Calicoe it was a three piece and Jordan 12's
Nigga you can't match a fit?
You some tacky bitch
Nigga had on a suit and taxi's like The Pursuit Of Happiness
Savageness
This man be trollin'
He be gettin' up there lookin' like Huey Newton, niggas just laugh at Loaded
I don't know why the Black Panther went out like that on stage for (4); Chadwick Boseman
I have to smoke him
I'ma do him bad for y'all
I'm GOATed
So you gotta be one brave man Loaded, like a human cannonball
After all, what I now notice is takin' a picture of Calico's ass wild brodie
I had to tell him now
I figured the only reason you kept the file
Is cause you wanted to be down, Loaded (downloaded)
Wow brodie
You kept the pic and then you shared the shit
That make me think 'Everything Healthy' downlow, like a food pyramid
We got tools in the whip, on high alert
These switches? Illegal, you gotta know where to buy it first
Like fireworks
Most of the shit I got, not even allowed (a loud) Pop like these silencers
When it's time for work? Fuck a hater
I won't argue, I'ma pop the trunk for starters, like jumper cables
Mom at the gravesite cryin', "They took my baby"
At the tombstone, drop to her knees like The Undertaker
You fuckin' crazy?
What's the problem with niggas?
If we would've battled on a buildin' he would've probably quit it
I mean try fightin' and bow out, on the roof top like Lottery Ticket
Bombin' on niggas, this .40 open up
Stomach shot, 'Everything Healthy' spillin' out, it's a cornucopia
I'm smokin' cuz
I put a bullet in your top tight
I got a workout routine like Lux too, I do pullups at the stop light
You all hype, jump if ya want
I have ya body missin'
They haven't found cuz in a month, they persistent though
They ain't givin' up on the hunt
If you know anything about the Apollo stump, then your Lux (lucks) in the trunk
You'll get slumped
Most of your opponents, you 30'd (3-0)
But the last two won (2-1) Loaded
It's like comparin' 30 Nits (Nittys) to one Loaded
I told him, "I'ma grab the 30 clip to unload it"
You done Loaded
You don't believe me I'll show you
All three I'm goin postal
When it comes to the rooftop I got the Juice, I ain't even gon' hold you
I told you
You can't keep it real yourself-Embed
