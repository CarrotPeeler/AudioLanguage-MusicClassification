With the receiver in my hand and religion in my heart

Jesus said to his disciples, "Come and carry my mother home"

Dying will be easy, Jesus gon' make up my

When it get down to Jordan have the ferryman guide it across
Done gone over, ahh, oh well
Done gone over, make up myYou might also likeEmbed
