- Experience of life?
The experience of life. The mind has to do with meaning, in here, what's the meaning of a flower? That Zen story of the sermon of the Buddha when his whole company was gathered and he simply lifted a flower. There was only one man, Kasyapa, who gave him a sign with his eye, that he understood what was Zen. What's the meaning of the universe? What's the meaning of a flee? It's just there, that's it. And your own meaning is that you're there
