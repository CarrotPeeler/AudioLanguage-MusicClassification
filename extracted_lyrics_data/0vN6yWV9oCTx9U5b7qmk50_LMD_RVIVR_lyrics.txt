3 ContributorsLMD LyricsYOU WAKE UP IN THE RAIN
SOAKED WITH A FEELING YOU CAN'T QUITE EXPLAIN
YOU WANNA TAKE PISS IN HOLY WATER
BECAUSE THE PIGS AND THE PRIESTS AND "THE RUDES AND THE CHEAPS"
THEY CAUGHT YOU IN THEIR WAR
NO!
YOU WAKE UP IN THE STORM
TIRED OF SCREAMING SINCE THE DAY YOU WERE BORN
BUT THE SKY AIN'T PISSING HOLY WATER
IT MAKES YOU WET AND IT MAKES YOU DEAD THERE'S NO ONE COMING FOR YA
NO!
NO!
(YA GOTTA LET IT GO CUZ YA CAN'T GO HOME)
THEY GOT YER NAME BOI
LIFE MOTTLE DECOI
DON'T SOUND NOTHIN LIKE THE ONE INSIDE YOU
YOU GOT A FIERCE LIGHT
SO LET IT SHINE BRIGHT
LOOK EM IN THE EYE AND LET THOSE HIGH BEAMS GUIDE YOU
LET IT SHINE
LET IT SHINE
MAKE A SIGN IN THE NIGHT
LET IT SHINEYou might also like1Embed
