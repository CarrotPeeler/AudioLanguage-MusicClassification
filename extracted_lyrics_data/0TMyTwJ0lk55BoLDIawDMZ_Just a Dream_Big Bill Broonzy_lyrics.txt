1 ContributorJust A Dream LyricsIt was a dream, just a dream I had on my mind
It was a dream, just a dream I had on my mind
And when I woke up, baby, not a thing could I find
I dreamed I went out with an angel, and had a good time
I dreamed I was satisfied, and nothin' to worry my mind
But it was just a dream, just a dream I had on my mind
And when I woke up, baby, not an angel could I find
I dreamed I played policy and played the horses too
I dreamed I win so much money, I didn't know what to do
But it was just a dream, just a dream I had on my mind
And when I woke up, baby, not a penny could I find
Play it man
I dreamed I was married, and started a family
I dreamed I had ten children, and they all looked just like me
But that was a dream, just a dream I had on my mind
And when I woke up baby, not a child could I findYou might also likeEmbed
