System on overdrive
Do
Don't you want?
Do
When I fall asleep I leave the TV on
Flashes in my head ringing strong
It doesn't mean that
We're not alone yet
This is the night when I said
We could leave there
All the computers we connect with the
Connect the MIDI, Computers can do it
I'm in love
System on overdrive
Nothing to give em'
Computers without the system on
I'm in love
I'm in love
System on overdrive

Flashes in my head ringing strong
Telling me to break inside
Telling me to say goodnight
When I fall asleep I leave the TV on
Flashes in my head ringing strong
It doesn't mean that
We're not alone yet
This is the night when I said
We could leave there
You're not alone yet
I'm in love
You're telling me that
I'm in loveEmbed
