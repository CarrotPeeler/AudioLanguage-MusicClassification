Musta-krakish
Musta-krakish
The time has come to awaken him
Musta-krakish
Musta-krakish
I call upon the ancient lords of the underworld
To bring forth this beast, and

Awaken, awaken, awaken, awaken
Take the land that must be taken
Awaken, awaken, awaken, awaken
Devour worlds, smite forsaken

Rise up from your thousand-year-old sleep
Break forth from your grave eternally
I command you to
Rise, rise, rise, rise
Rise, rise, rise, rise

I'm the conjurer of demons
I'm the father of your deth
I bring forth the ancient evil
I control his every breath
I instigate your misfortune
With the birth of killing trolls
I awaken Armageddon
Feeding on a thousand souls
Awaken, awaken, awaken, awaken

Awaken, awaken, awaken, awaken
Take the land that must be taken
Awaken, awaken, awaken, awaken
Devour worlds, smite forsaken

Rise up from your thousand-year-old sleep
Break forth from your grave eternally
Weak will die and land will all be burned
Mustakrakish king and deth to worlds

I command you to
Rise, rise, rise, rise
Rise, rise, rise, rise
Rise, rise, rise, rise
Rise, rise, rise, rise
And awaken1Embed
