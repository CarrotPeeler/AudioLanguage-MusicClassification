1 ContributorStay With Me Lyrics
One, two, three, four!

I shuffles down the street
My eyes are on my feet
I got no place to go
I try to reason why
But end up getting high
I'm drinking more, it shows
I stare into the TV screen
But every face reminds me of a girl
I never used to be so mean
But I can't bear to face my shattered world

You just ain't fair to this Romeo
I fell apart when I watched you go
Baby, baby, baby

My, my, my, my, my, my, my heart is calling
Won't you stay with me?
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my heart is calling
Won't you stay with me?
You might also like
The stars, they used to shine
But now my tears, they're blind
The fun we used to have
At night, I toss and turn
The memories, they burn
I don't know how to laugh
I try to make the social scene
But I get drunk and turn into a fool
Then I start a fight, because
I'm only half the man I was with...

You said we'd never part 'til we die
Why didn't you stop when you heard me cry?
Baby, baby, baby

My, my, my, my, my, my, my heart is calling
Won't you stay with me?
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my heart is calling
Won't you stay with me?


Baby, baby, baby
My, my, my, my, my, my, my heart is calling
Won't you stay with me?
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my heart is calling
Won't you stay with me?
My, my, my, my, my, my, my heart is calling
Won't you stay with me?
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my heart is calling
Won't you stay with me?Embed
