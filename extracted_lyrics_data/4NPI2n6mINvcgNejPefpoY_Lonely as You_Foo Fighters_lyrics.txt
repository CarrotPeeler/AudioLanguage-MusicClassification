14 ContributorsLonely as You Lyrics
What would I do, lonely as you
Pleasure or pain, I can't choose
What would I do, lonely as you
Pleasure or pain, I can't choose

Wake up, you're dreamin', I can't stand your screamin'
Drownin' out these prayers, just some words without meanin'
Spare all the preachin', my secrets worth keepin'
No one understands like I do
Keep out of reach, I'm your leadin' deletion
Hide behind these masks, though they still see right through them

Every now and then, you're down and out, my friend
Down and out again, down and out again
Down and out again, but I'm down with you

One more time for the last time (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
One more time for release (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
One more time for the last time (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
Everyone wants to believe (Oh-oh-oh-oh)

Blame it on youth, all these years I've been losin'
Blame it on the past, it's the last place I knew you
Blame all the children, they're ragin' and ruined
Blame it on the black and the blue
You might also like
Every now and then, you're down and out, my friend
Down and out again, down and out again
Down and out again, but I'm down with you

One more time for the last time (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
One more time for release (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
One more time for the last time (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
Everyone wants to believe (Oh-oh-oh-oh)


Every now and then! You're down and out, my friend
Down and out again! Down and out again!
Down and out again but I'm down with you

One more time for the last time! (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
One more time for release! (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
One more time for the last time! (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
Everyone wants to believe! (Oh-oh-oh-oh)

One more time for the last time! One more time for release!
One more time for the last time! Everyone wants to believe!
One more time for the last time! One more time for release!
One more time for the very last time! Everyone wants to believe, alright!2Embed
