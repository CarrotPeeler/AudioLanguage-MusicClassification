1 ContributorFound Love LyricsHey, I found love (Found love)
But I caught it looking up
It sounds dumb (Sounds dumb)
Well, I thought it wasn't what I'm made of (Made of)
I guess there's nothing left to say
Mmmm, I found love (Found love)
In between two layers of the same stuff (Same stuff)
I think my bitter dreams are made up (Made up)
Feelings I've got to obey
Now she's excellent at not wearing pants
And waking me up in the morning
And if something ain't right
About seeing the light, through wisps of her hair
Then I don't have a prayer
Because I found love (Found love)
But I caught it hooking up
It sounds dumb (Sounds dumb)
I thought it wasn't what I'm made of (Made of)
Now I guess there's nothing left to say
Now she's excellent at not wearing pants
And waking me up in the morning
And something ain't right
About seeing the light, through wisps of her hair
Then I don't have a prayer

From the bell, to the pick-up, to the depot (Depot)
I'm going everywhere that she goes (She goes)
I'm giving all my stuff away
I'm giving all my stuff away
I'm giving everything awayEmbed
