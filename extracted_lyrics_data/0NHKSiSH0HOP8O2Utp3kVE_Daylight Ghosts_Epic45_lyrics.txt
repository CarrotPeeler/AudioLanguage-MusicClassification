2 ContributorsDaylight Ghosts LyricsThose days seem so far away now
Everything ends
The night sky, autumn fires
Summer days, waiting for you
To meet you by the bridge
Just to kiss
Too much time's been wasted
In sadness, precious days and nights
Faded pictures, decaying sounds
Future's blinding, there's everything to play forYou might also likeEmbed
