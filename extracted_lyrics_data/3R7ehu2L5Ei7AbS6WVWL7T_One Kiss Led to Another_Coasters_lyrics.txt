3 ContributorsOne Kiss Led to Another Lyrics
My girlfriend was babysitting down the street
And so I bought some soda pop and sandwich meat
She laid it on the table and I took a seat
But I never got the chance to drink or eat

Cause one kiss led to another
And another and another
One kiss led to another
And another and another

The lights were low when she turned on the radio
I could hear the music playing soft and low
I said, we'd better dance before I flip my lid
We both got up to dance but we never did

Cause one kiss led to another
And another and another
One kiss led to another
And another and another

I thought the night was young until I saw the clock
The clock was striking midnight, it was quite a shock
I started for the door but she grabbed my sleeve
She put her arms around me, man, I couldn't leave

Cause one kiss led to another
And another and another
One kiss led to another
And another and another
One kiss led to another
And another and another
And another and another
And another and another
And another and anotherEmbed
