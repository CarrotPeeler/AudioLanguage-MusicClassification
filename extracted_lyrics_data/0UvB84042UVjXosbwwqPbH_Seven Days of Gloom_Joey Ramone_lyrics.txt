1 ContributorSeven Days of Gloom LyricsSeven days of gloom
Here in my room
If it wasn't for the Stooges
My life would be doomed
I'll never be happy - no no no no
I'll never be happy - no no no no
I'll never be happy
I'll never be happy - no no no no
I'll never be happy - no no no no
I'll never be happy
Be happy again
Seven days of gloom
Here in my room
If it wasn't for sushi
My life would be ruined
I'll never be happy - no no no no
I'll never be happy - no no no no
I'll never be happy
I'll never be happy - no no no no
I'll never be happy - no no no no
I'll never be happy
Be happy againYou might also likeEmbed
