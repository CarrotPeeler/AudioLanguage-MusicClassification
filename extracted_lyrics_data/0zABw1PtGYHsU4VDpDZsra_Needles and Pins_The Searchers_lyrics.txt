14 ContributorsNeedles and Pins Lyrics

I saw her today, I saw her face
It was a face I loved, and I knew
I had to run away
And get down on my knees and pray
That they'd go away

But still they begin, ah
Needles and pins, ah
Because of all my pride
The tears I gotta hide

Hey, I thought I was smart, I won her heart
Didn't think I'd do, but now I see
She's worse to him than me
Let her go ahead, take his love instead
And one day she will see

Just how to say please
And get down on her knees
Yeah, that's how it begins
She'll feel those needles and pins
Hurtin' her, hurtin' her
You might also like
Why can't I stop
And tell myself I'm wrong
I'm wrong, so wrong?
Why can't I stand up
And tell myself I'm strong?

Because I saw her today, I saw her face
It was a face I loved, and I knew
I had to run away
And get down on my knees and pray
That they'd go away

But still they begin, ah
Needles and pins, ah
Because of all my pride
The tears I gotta hide

Oh, needles and pins, ah
Needles and pins, ah
Needles and pins, ahEmbed
