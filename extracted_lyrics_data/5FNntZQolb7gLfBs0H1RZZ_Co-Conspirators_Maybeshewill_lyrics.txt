3 ContributorsCo-Conspirators LyricsWell, you know, so much of the time we're just lost
We say, "Please, God, tell us what is right, tell us what is true"
I mean, there is no justice
The rich win, the poor are powerless
We become tired of hearing people lie
And after a time we become dead, a little dead
We think of ourselves as victims, and we become victims
We become, we become
We become weak, we doubt ourselves, we doubt our beliefs, and we doubt the law
But today you are the lawYou might also likeEmbed
