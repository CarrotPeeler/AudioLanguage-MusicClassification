1 ContributorHey Girl Lyrics
She said: "Sorry but it's over
You can't stay with me no more
I've got another crazy lover
Pack your things and shut the door."

I said: "Hey girl
All I need is one more time."
I said: "Suzy
Baby, would you be so kind?"

She said: "Your nose is running, honey"
I said: "Sorry, but it's snot"
She said: "Your breath smells funny"
"Nice you've mentioned, thanks a lot"

I said: "Hey girl
All I need is one more time"
I said: "Suzy
Baby, would you be so kind?"

Turn me on, I'm feeling down (Feeling down)
You're my only friend around
I want
Someone like you
You've got to give me one more chance (One more chance)
I got a rocket in my pants
I want
Someone like you
You might also like

I said: Hey girl (Wee-oo, hey!)
Hey girl (Wee-oo, hey!)
Hey girl, all I need is one more time (Wee-oo)
I said: Hey girl, all I need is one more (Wee-oo, hey!)
Hey girl, all I need is one more (Wee-oo, hey!)
Hey girl, all I need is one more time (Wee-oo)

One more time!Embed
