1 ContributorAnimals LyricsLived your life according to me
I was always down with that
"Insanity through cool make believe"
You would always tell me that
Oh it seems that you know me
Better than I know myself
Follow on in blind disbelief
See me on the other side
Promise leaves in cold make believe
You could always call me out
Oh it seems that you know me
Better than I know myself
Fawns blink in the light
The woodland's ours tonight
Pretend we're animals
Hoofs for fingers
Spent our time according to dreams
That would sometimes freak me out
A bird of prey circles our themes
Pecking round at all my doubts
Oh it seems that you know me
Better than I know myself
Fawns blink in the light
The woodland's ours tonight
Pretend we're animals
Hoofs for fingers
You stumble like a foal
When we've still got miles to go
Pretend we're animals
But you don't think so
Fawns blink in the light
The woodland's ours tonight
Pretend we're animals
Hoofs for fingers
You stumble like a foal
When we've still got miles to go
Pretend we're animals
But you don't think soYou might also likeEmbed
