3 ContributorsAnti-Christ LyricsScreams and nightmares of a
Life I want
Can't see living this lie no
A world I want
You've lost all control of my
Heart and my soul
Satan holds the future
Watch it unfold
I am the Antichrist
It's what I've got to be
Your God left me behind
And set my soul to be free
Watching disciples of the
Satanic rule
Pentagram of blood
Holds the jackal's truth
Searching for the answer
Christ hasn't come
Awaiting the final moment
The birth of Satan's son
I am the Antichrist
All love is lost
Insanity is what I am
Eternally my soul will rotYou might also likeEmbed
