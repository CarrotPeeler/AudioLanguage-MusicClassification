2 ContributorsMetamorphosis LyricsEyes opening
Feels like the walls is closing in
Frozen and can’t move
Can’t soothe these moods confused
From black view fusing with feeling blue
Like patios the surroundings feeling like backyard
Soil, turmoil tossing like groundhog
Vision skewed like after glaucoma tests
Is this a nest?
A burial ground?
A purgatory for the storyboard until I’m found?
Old me shedding like tears for dead Hommies
In here it’s lonely
Isolated, dark and moldy
Can’t flee, frustrated and fading slowly
Like bright lights that’s just battery charged
Stark naked feeling changes feeling faintish
Positively parched baking
Twisted up in this rut semi-squashed
Like wrapped Danish forgotten
In the pocket of your favorite jeans
Make no mistaking
Ain’t nothing sweet
With the heat blaring
I’m tearing to the point I’m not seeing clear and...
You might also likeI’m feeling kinda’ strange
I feel this inner change moving me
Am I soon to be in a different place?
A different phase
Am I losing me?
Or just becoming great
It’s shifting me
It’s bliss to be in this cocoon state
Sometimes it gets so quiet
I can hear the crickets jumping
People humming
Voices distorted muffled saying something
Can’t make it out clear, can’t make it out here
The sides suffocating me like false pride
Force, pry this open I’m hoping but no luck
Feeling stuck in this muck, thick like Irish Moss or sea weed
The more I fight to get this thing opened
The more my fingers bleed
Scraping the rim escaping is thin
Like anorexics unless its breaking the lid
Busting like appendix or implants gone bad
But what’s the chance, odds?
So change the stance, charge
Meditate, get it straight, keep God in foresight
Garden the harvest despite circumstance
Disturbing like ants insects rodents
No holding me back, no showing your lack
Relax, Focus
Know where you at
Even in your transition
Till transmission of lotus
Shifting into 5th gear
Ready to blow this
I’m feeling kinda’ strange
I feel this inner change moving me
Am I soon to be in a different place?
A different phase
Am I losing me?
Or just becoming great
It’s shifting me
It’s bliss to be in this cocoon state
I feel the pressure building
A serum spilling
Am I filling out like pregnancy?
I Better be a better me
Taking form
Challenges able to take on destiny
Getting stronger, wider
Morphing
Fibers growing
Showing higher self
Mother and emcee, sister to brothers plenty
Ready for that new phase
Taking new shape
Like hydrogen two oxygen make, emulate
The chemistry’s great
At the end of the day
The pain from nerves exposed was worth the ache
Cause watch my pull, wisdom
With Full vision
Prison popping
Prism shocking
Diamond in the rough
Blood rushing in
Colors coming in like lavender to wings fluttering
I’m feeling kinda’ strange
I feel this inner change moving me
Am I soon to be in a different place?
A different phase
Am I losing me?
Or just becoming great
It’s shifting me
It’s bliss to be in this cocoon stateEmbed
