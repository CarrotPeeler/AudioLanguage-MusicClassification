4 ContributorsMe and My Desire LyricsThis is me and my desire
Taking all that I require
Such a pretty sight to see
And there's nothing left for me
Well you know it's very funny
And I don't have much money
Change my colour it's a dare
Change my face and my hair
Don't wanna be a moving part
Back door ladies rearranger
Don't want to feel the cold nights bite
In and out of my life
Fascinated for a while
It's the colour of your smile
And it's plain there's nothing free
It's not good enough for me
Don't wanna be a moving part
Back door ladies rearranger
Don't want to feel the cold nights bite
In and out of my life
It's a break up such a make up
What do you desire
No more fake up need a shake up
What do you desire

Taking all that I require
Well you know it's very funny
Such a pretty sight to see
Don't wanna be a moving part
Back door ladies rearranger
Don't want to feel the cold nights bite
In and out of my life
This is me and my desire
Taking all that I require
Well you know it's very funny
And I don't have much money
Me and my? Me and my
Me and my desire
Me and my desireEmbed
