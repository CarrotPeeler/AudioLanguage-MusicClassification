Remember, do you
Do you remember
As you flew around the corner on a flying carpet
As I woke, I woke up
In this dreamless metabolic forest
Die, die, die
Then there was your cup of ideas
I thought you were intented for advices, for advices
From wheresoever
And I dropped my volition
And you see
What comes out
What comes out
When we hypnotize our whatever
Whatever it is meant to be
Your dream is not coloured
I think you should get back in time
Your dream is not coloured
You`ve never ordered me to draw a line
Your dream is not covered
I`ll get you neither a pillow nor a blanket to define
You might also likeDie, die, die
Then there was a light
And what a monkey business
A monkey business
From wheresoever
I dropped my voice
And you see what comes out
What comes out
And you see what comes out
What comes out
When we
Your dream is not coloured
I think you should get back in time
Your dream is not coloured
You`ve never ordered me to draw a line
Your dream is not covered
I`ll get you neither a pillow nor a blanket to define
Your dream is not coloured
So give me the finest paintbrush dived
In sweeping shine
The finest paintbrush dived in sweeping shine
Die, die, dieEmbed
