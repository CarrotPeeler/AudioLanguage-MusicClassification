11 ContributorsHumiliation Lyrics
Why does it always have to end with humiliation for me?
Why does it always have to end with humiliation for me?
I'll tell you why
I'll die
I'll tell you why

I'm in love with the girl I am
Who is smarter and stronger
And braver than I'll ever be
Be

Why does it always have to end with humiliation for me?
Why does it always have to end with humiliation for me?
I'll tell you why
I wanna die
I'll tell you why

He comes shunnie, it's time to shrink
To be smaller than a grain of salt
In the wide sea is all I'll ever be
All I'll ever beYou might also like1Embed
