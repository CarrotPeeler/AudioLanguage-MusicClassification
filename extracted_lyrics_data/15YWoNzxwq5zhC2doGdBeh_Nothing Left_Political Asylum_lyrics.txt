Bad vibrations!
Manifestation!
Ooby-Scooby Doomsday, I'm waiting for you
Well Mr. Politician, while you're smiling
Your actions up behind you, they are filing
To lock you in political asylum
Oh my papa's got money
Oh my papa's got slaves
Oh my papa's got power
He has fun with bombs and guns, oh how
You talk about the left wing
You talk about the right wing
Being nothing's getting pretty frightening
My little boy's got money
My little boy's got drugs
My little boy's got crazy
Sticks and stones don't break his dreams, no never
Revolution!
Bad vibrations!
Manifestation!
Ooby-Scooby Doomsday, I'm waiting for you
See Gong LiveGet tickets as low as $114You might also likeWe go to demonstrations
We picket rocket stations
And then we try to bomb the installation
Oh my mama, don't worry
Oh my mama, I'm sorry
Oh my mama loves her sherry
She wears gloves when she makes love, oh kick it
It's getting very strange
Maybe we're just deranged
I tell you, something's gonna change
You change your god for another
Change your telly for a color
You change your book for your mother
Nothing is for, nothing is forgotten
I don't want no ugly revolution
Just wanna get high, just wanna get high
I don't want no ugly revolution
Just wanna get by, you know just wanna get by
Nice cup of tea in the morning
Nice cup of tea with my tea
Don't want no sugar in my tea
I've got more sugar in my D.D.T
My D.D.T., my D.D.T
Fe, fi, fo, fum
I smell the blood of an Englishman
Ho, fi, fo, fum
I smell a stereo Englishman
Knees up, Mother Brown
Now you're here and now you're Gong
Love me, touch me, feel me do
I love miracles, I do
Let us go to church and be good-looking
(Oh, sweet mystery of life, at last I've found you)
(Oh, sweet mystery of life, at last I've found you)
(Oh, sweet mystery of life, at last I've found you)
Ahhhhh... choo!Embed
