5 ContributorsSharon LyricsI was at this carnival, just a few years ago
No big deal, ferris wheel, the same ol’ stuff you know
And I wandered around the grounds until I found this little tent
Man outside made a speech, and this is how it went
“She walks, she talks, she crawls on her belly like a reptile”
It was the same ol’ line, except for one part
He said “It don’t cost no money, you gotta pay with your heart.”

You know the same rowdy crowd that was here last night is back again
‍                                                                                                            Well I went inside, I looked around for a seat
The the lights went low, and the drums played a beat
Then this girl came out dressed in a scarf and a sneeze
She did a little dance that made me weak in the knees
She danced just like her back had no bone
While the band played a tune they called the “Main Street Moan”
She smiled a smile the whole world could see
And then She turned around, and looked staraight at me
I must’ve jumped at least six feet in the air
And when I come down, that girl wasn't there
‍                                                                                                               Oh, Sharon, what do you do to these men?
You know the same rowdy crowd that was here last night is back again
‍                                                                                                               Then out come this dude with curly, red hair
He had a big bushy beard and he was built like a bear
He said, “You stop yer shoutin,’ there's no more to the show
If you wanna breathe right, y'all better go.”
Well I didn’t hang around, I headed straight for the door
But on my way out, I heard that big bear roar
‍                                                                                                               Oh, Sharon, what do you do to these men?
You know the same rowdy crowd that was here last night is back again
‍                                                                                                               Every time that that show played, I was right there
I stayed out off reach of that mean, red bear
And it was just like the man said in his speech at the start
When that carnie left town it took a piece of my heart
And I still get a funny feeling deep down in my bone
Every time I hear a band play that “Main Street Moan”
‍                                                                                                               Oh, Sharon, what do you do to these men?
You know the same rowdy crowd that was here last night is back again
‍                                                                                                               Oh, Sharon, what do you do to these me?
