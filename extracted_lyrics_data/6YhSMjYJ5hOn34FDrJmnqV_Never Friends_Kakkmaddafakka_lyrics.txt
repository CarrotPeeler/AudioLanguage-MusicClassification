5 ContributorsNever Friends LyricsWind and water, Bergen town, dark from 4, no people around
No people around
Big, warm room. Five meters from the floor to the ceiling
This is where people seek healing
Music made for houses makes me want to move my body
Makes me want to move that body
All the people are showing me love. No better place to be alone than in a club
You're never alone in the club
I just met you. But you're more than a friend to me. More than a friend
I just met you. I can never be friends with you. Never be friends
Take me down to your river. I got a tree that you can climb
You whisper in my air how you want me to swim in your water
I wanna be your inspiration. I wanna be a part of your imagination
I wanna be your painting. I wanna be your painter
Let me be Munch for you. Let me be Matisse for you
Let me be Da Vinci for you. I'm gonna go Picasso on you!
Girl, take me to your secret place. We can fly higher than the moon
I just met you. But you're more than a friend to me. More than a friend
I just met you. I can never be friends with you. Never be friends
I've got some predictions for the future:
You're gonna talk about me with your mama
You're gonna tell her that I maybe be the one
You might also likeYou're papa's gonna wanna be meeting me
And your younger brother's gonna look up to me
But they don't know what I'm doing to you
Cause you don't tell them what we do in your room
Girl, we can never be friends!
Oh, God I wish this never endsâ€¦
I just met you. But you're more than a friend to me. More than a friend
I just met you. I can never be friends with you
Never be friendsEmbed
