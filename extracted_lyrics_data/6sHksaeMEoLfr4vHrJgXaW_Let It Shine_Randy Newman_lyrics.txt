Whatever happened to the things you used to do?
And all the dreams you dreamed so long?
Stop livin' in the past, the good times never last
Now's the time for movin' on

Let it shine, let it shine, let it shine
If there's hope in your heart then let it shine
Let it shine, let it shine, let it shine, shine, shine
If there's hope in your heart then let it shine

Why don't you ever do all that you wanna do?
There's nothin' stoppin' you, you know
You've waited all this time to leave the past behind
Now it's fine to let it go

Let it shine, let it shine, let it shine
If there's hope in your heart then let it shine
Let it shine, let it shine, let it shine, shine, shine
If there's hope in your heart then let it shineYou might also likeEmbed
