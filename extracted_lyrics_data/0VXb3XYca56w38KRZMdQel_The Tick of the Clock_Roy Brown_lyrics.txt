2 ContributorsJust a Man Lyrics

Misunderstanding in this world
People are hurting one another (Oh, oh, oh)
Misunderstanding in this world
People are hurting one another (Oh, oh)

I been burdened by the pressure of living under a failing system
Burning out under fear of cancellation by many millions
Who demands I work within an ecosystem that never affirms if
You did your part of the job, but tears you down if you cannot finish
And how can I reach out if my closest ones are backstabbers
Snakes to go attack you when you need help, when it most matters
And why am I the one that’s getting punishеd for their worst actions?
I defend mysеlf from monsters, yet I’m the one that they label after?
Now I keep paranoia and anger as my only layers of protection
And the only friends I let me have are ones too far away to do me damage
I live with the devil; every night, he reminds me, “What you’re worth, you’re less than”
And he brings examples of all the times I failed to be the better man
Or maybe that’s just me again
The mic’s my only confidant, so I go pick up the pen, and then
Write down all my self-pitying thoughts before I shame myself for having them
‘Cause if the world is gonna judge me, then I might as well judge myself
‘Cause it’s weak to admit that-
You might also like
I'm just a man with nothing else but music
Oh, sweet music (Oh, oh, oh)
I'm just a man with nothing else but music
Oh, sweet music (Oh, oh)

I find it hard to keep my peace and find my inner balance
When I am pulled apart by a range of family dynamics
A spectrum from an uncle who’s a religious fanatic
To aunts who believe that God is the same as magic, who could imagine?
From drunkards and smokers to the most pious of them all
And here I am afraid of which side of the line I fall
‘Cause no matter where I fall, I lose a part of my fam behind divisive walls
Powered by tradition, fear, and arrogance; no matter so many fold
Wise men say I can never please everybody
But if I can’t please everybody, I can never please anybody
If I can’t please anybody, I can never please myself
And I fall into the cyclical trap of looking for love in hell
Thankfully, me and my mother’s relationship has grown better since “reflections.”
But I don’t think she understands all the questions that power my depression
Frankly, I also don’t understand; half of my answers, I am guessing
And I don’t think I'll ever understand
I hate to admit it, but I am nothing but just a man

I'm just a man with nothing else but music
Oh, sweet music (Oh, oh, oh)
I'm just a man with nothing else but music
Oh, sweet music
Misunderstanding in this world
People are hurting one another
Misunderstanding in this world
People are hurting one another


Man, nobody wants to hear this emotional bullshit, bro
Pick yourself up and make a banger, motherfucker!
Bronson, this shit hard, ooh!

I am just a man, got no time for the bullshit
If they make demands, out my life, cut the loose ends
I am just a man, got no time for the bullshit
If they make demands, out my life, cut the loose ends

Used to read Lester Sumerall, looking for ways to cast out my demons
Now these demons give me some or all of that drive, making me kill these beats, and
If it ain’t right with God, let him play Mick Gordon, I lean forward in my seat, then
Spell out doom for all of these heathens; shit get gory when I sink my teeth in, woo!
"I am not weak!", shoutout to Infinite
Debut like Shady, but know I ain’t him again
Reckless decision won’t take out my team again
Tighten the circle 'till everyone eating grand
Except you, who put on a mask and try to play fake hard
I put on my mask and spell out your doom, ‘cause my raps state of art
Bronson my Madlib, we take y’all game apart
I could give a fuck about what I should even worry ‘bout
Or I could just pick out my targets and make them worry now
When I came out of the hands of 12, I was an animal
Now the clock hands tick, tick, tick down ‘till you watch me end you all
I gon’ ground you down 6 feet with a scheme that’s 3 meanings deep
‘Cause I’m done focusing on bullshit that gon’ rob me of sleep
Heterochromatic light behind their eyes, how I tell who the snakes be
But do I stomp upon their heads, or do I leave it up to Eve? Man, you tell me
Gotta keep it pushin’; time, live it to the fullest
I never heed the bullshit, lies never heed the truth
I will achieve repute thy will never use to try and steal some views
That-that-that might put you into good eyes
But I know you a liar tryna cash in on the IG follows and likes
I could never be you guys, getting clout off a name I am better than (Wait)
My luck gon' be the same as the end of Jonah name
But I take it up by 3, Silk Sonic in your waves (Remember the name)
Your f- ahhh, ha-ha!
You get the point, I could do this all day
But let me pass this onto the next person on this beat to slay, it’s RO-B. Z
(Bronson, bring back the fucking beat!)
I am just a man, got no time for the bullshit
If they make demands, out my life, cut the loose ends
I am just a man, got no time for the bullshit
If they make demands, out my life, cut the loose ends (Yeah, bitch)

Never could you ever 
Own my credit, debit; credit busting on a predecessor
Letter F for finessing these lil' rappers and these mellow felons
Hello, hell or heaven, I ain't ever stressin'
Got you singing like Evanescence
Put an extra bullet in your cerebellum
Got an extra full clip, and I'm very tethered
I don't like the bullshit, I don't like the texting
I don't ride the bull's back or write the message
Gotta spy on fools, and we could cry together
When your body drippin' like some rainy weather
I get paid good, and you can pay me better
Picasso can paint me better
Any day or ever, I am paid forever
I am Shady, lady, crazy lading ridin' some Mercedes
Asking for another record, I said, "Hol' up, bitch"
Give me a second, don't think that I said it
That tool and the ink, I put and just set it
Who the hell is tellin'? Boo, the crowd is yellin'
Move him out the way, and let me get my set in
Move him out the way, and let me get my set in
Move him out the way, and let me get my set in
Move him out the way, and let me get my-
 when I'm fuckin' up
 on a Motorola
Sold my telephone, and I am bubblin', Pepsi-Cola
Overdosin' on Dr. Pepper, can be stolen any moment
Hicky swollen, bones breakin'
If you really want it, if you really smokin'
I'mma take his blunt and turn it to a brooch
Homie kill it, prolly treat it like a rodent
Eatin' my opponents, cigar my aroma, be the highest, solar
Stumbilin', step on him, bill him out of order
Get him out of court, and get him out of sorts
Simply out of words, or simply out of Earth, Lord
I'm simply out of Earth, Andrew Kelly, huh, Lord

People are hurt-t-ting one anotherEmbed
