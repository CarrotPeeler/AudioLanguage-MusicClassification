7 ContributorsIf So Lyrics
Everybody's taking what they can
But they can't decide
And they do what they want to
'Cause any kind of feeling's alright

And don't be talking maybe
Your mama's flying high as a kite
You're just like the next one
'Cause we'll be walking lonely tonight
Lonely tonight

If so, if so
We know, we'll be coming
If so, if so
We know, we'll be coming
If so, if so
We know, we'll be coming

Everyone's faking like they can
It makes it alright
Tell me what you want to
'Cause I don't know the wrong from the right
You might also like
Just don't be talking maybe
Your mama's still high as a kite
And I'm just like the next one
'Cause we'll be walking lonely tonight
Lonely tonight

If so, if so
We know, we'll be coming
If so, if so
We know, we'll be coming
If so, if so
We know, we'll be coming

If so, if so
We know, we'll be coming
If so, if so
We know, we'll be coming
If so, if so
We know, we'll be coming7Embed
