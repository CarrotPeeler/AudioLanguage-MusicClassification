Well, when my first wife left me
God knows put that on the road
Well, when my first wife left me
God knows put that on the road
Yeah you know since that day, now people
I've sleeping on door to door

We ain't no  travellin' people

When my baby take me back again

When my baby take me back again
God knows I won't leave my home no more
When my baby take me back again
God knows I won't leave my home no more
Yeah I just stand on my baby
And God knows I would settle downYou might also likeEmbed
