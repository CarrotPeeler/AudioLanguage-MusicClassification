2 ContributorsChinese Envoy Lyrics
She was a princess, lower than people thought
A master of nothing, a mistress of something she thought

She could talk about things that never mattered ever
From one person's miserable life after another
Talk to the French and Germans at will
They never listen, they never will

The Chinese envoy was here
The Chinese еnvoy was here
The Chinеse envoy was here but left
Yes, the Chinese envoy was here
The Chinese envoy was here but left

Calling out her name you'd be surprised at what came
Galloping out of the darkness just like furniture
To forgive all if it hadn't been for Cardinal Richelieu and all his courtiers

But the Chinese envoy was here
The Chinese envoy was here but left
Yes, the Chinese envoy was here
The Chinese envoy was here but left
In his broken hearted pagodaSee John Cale LiveGet tickets as low as $56You might also likeEmbed
