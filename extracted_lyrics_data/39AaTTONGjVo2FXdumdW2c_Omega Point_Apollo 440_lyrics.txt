3 ContributorsOmega Point LyricsHey what's this?
Yea, excellent I love this kind of stuff
Is this your track or is this?
Hey, have you just put some ???
No longer any place mother nature can hide now
Far from space culture
Dazzling, spacial
At the instant the omega point is reached
Life will have gained control of all matter and forces
Not only in a single universe
But in all universes whose existence is logically possible
Life will have spread to all spacial regions in all universes
Which can logically exist
Weâ€™ll have stored an infinite amount of information
Including all this knowledge which is logically possible to know
No longer any place mother nature can hide
Far from space culture
Exude your phenomena, exude the phenomena
Turn it on, dazzling, spacial

You know the axis of the northern star shifts, like, two inches every year?
And it ends in the year 2000...11, on the New Year's of 2011, in the last
Half-hour
Is aaa when time speeds up
Come back, dazzling, spacial
Distant cosmos
Exude the phenomena
No longer any place mother nature can hide
Far from space culture
Exude your phenomena, exude the phenomena
Dazzling, spacial, turn it onEmbed
