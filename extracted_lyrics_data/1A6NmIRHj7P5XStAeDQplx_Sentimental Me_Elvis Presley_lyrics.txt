Sentimental me (Sentimental me)
Guess I'll always be (Guess I'll always be)
So in love with you
Say you love me too
Sentimental me

Dreaming while I live (Dreaming while I live)
Living just to give (Living just to give)
All my love to you
No one else will do
Sentimental me

Reaching for the moon
And no wishing on a star
On my honeymoon
I want to be where you are

Darling, can't you see? (Darling, can't you see?)
It was meant to be (It was meant to be)
I'm in love with you
Say you love me too
Sentimental me
You might also like
Reaching for the moon
And no wishing on a star
On my honeymoon
I want to be where you are

Darling, can't you see? (Darling, can't you see?)
It was meant to be (It was meant to be)
I'm in love with you
No one else will do
Sentimental meEmbed
