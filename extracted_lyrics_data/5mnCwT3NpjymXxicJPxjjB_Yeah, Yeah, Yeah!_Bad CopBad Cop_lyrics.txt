More than getting paid or the stars above
If you can keep 'em coming, we can keep it going all night
Alright!
We've only got one speed, and it's fast
We've only got one rule, and it's
Sleep when you're dead
Far as we know there's only one life we get to lead
No guarantees, we don't need a reason to believe in good times
I'll be making the most of every day til I go black
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!
I've got big dreams, and I've got big schemes
About how I'm gonna live my life
I'm gonna make it: watch me get naked
We're gonna take on the world
Alright!

We've only got one speed, and it's fast
We've only got one rule, and it's
Sleep when you're dead
Far as we know there's only one life we get to lead
No guarantees, we don't need a reason to believe in good times
I'll be making the most of every day til I go black
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!You might also likeEmbed
