Lord tell me why a white man ain't worth nothing in this world no more
Lord tell me how you 'spect me to stand up tall and proud
Now I did just what you told me (uh huh)
I done everything you said (oh yeah)
But the way I'm doing lately I could have stood in bed
So Lord tell me why a white man ain't worth nothing in this world no more

Lord tell me when a white man's gonna be all right again
Please fix it, Lord
They took back everything we'd been working for
Now when the riots tore our city  (uh huh)
I stood watch outside our home (oh yeah)
My kids crying daddy why can't they leave us alone?
Split level in Valencia (uh huh)  where the cops reside (one time)
We walked away and left old memories inside
Oh Lord, tell me why a white man ain't worth nothing in this world no more
God almighty

You walk across the silvery moon and get back home all right
But it ain't safe to walk the streets of your home town at night
Now I'm a Lord man from the Lord land
But a Lord man ain't worth nothing in this world no more

That's too bad
What happened?
Everybody was your friend
Where's everybody gone?
What happened to howdy neighbor, howdy
Nice to see you
Company comin' up the roadEmbed
