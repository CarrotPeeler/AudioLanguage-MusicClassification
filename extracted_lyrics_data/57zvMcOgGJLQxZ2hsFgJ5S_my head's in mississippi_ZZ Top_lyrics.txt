But my head's in Mississippi
I'm shuffling through the Texas sand
But my head's in Mississippi
The blues has got a hold of me
I believe I'm getting dizzy
 Help me now
I keep thinking 'bout that night in Memphis
Lord, I thought I was in Heaven
I keep thinking 'bout that night in Memphis
I thought I was in Heaven
But I was stumbling through the parking lot
Of an invisible 7-11
What was I doing out there?

Last night I saw a cowgirl
She was floating across the ceiling
And last night I saw a naked cowgirl
She was floating across the ceiling
She was mumbling to some howling wolf
About some voodoo healing
Where's my head baby?
Somewhere in Mississippi
