15 ContributorsGoinâ€™ Down Lyrics
Took me down to the river
So I could drown, drown, drown
Looking up through the water
I kept sinking down, down, down

I feel like I'm dying
I got one foot in the ground
Never knew what love was
Until you came around

You're going down
You're going down, down
You walk all over me
You never thought I'd be
The one who's laughing now
Now that you're going down

Take you down to the basement
You look around, round, round
And we sit there in silence
I watch you go down, down, down
You might also like
I feel like I'm flying
I got my head in the clouds
Never thought I was crazy
Until you came around

You're going down
You're going down, down
You walk all over me
You never thought I'd be
The one who's laughing now
Now that you're going down
You're going down, down
You walk all over me
You never thought I'd be
The one who's laughing now
Now that you're going down

Ha-ha, woo!
Took me down to the river
So I could drown, drown, drown

You're going down
You're going down, down
You walk all over me
You never thought I'd be
The one who's laughing now
Now that you're going down (Down, down, down)
You're going down, down (Down)
You walk all over me
You never thought I'd be (hought I'd be)
The one who's laughing now
Now that you're going down2Embed
