4 ContributorsYou’re My Girl (I Don’t Want to Discuss It) Lyrics
See your bag's packed and you're ready to go
There's just one thing I think that you all ought to know
You're my girl, woo
You're my girl
I don't wanna discuss it, woman
Ain't no need to try
I don't wanna discuss it, baby
Come on baby try
You're my girl, listen, baby, woo
You're my girl

I don't wanna talk about it
I don't wanna hear you say
I don't wanna even discuss it, woman
I don't wanna hear what you say
'Cause you know that
You're my girl, woo
You're my girl
You're my girl, woohoo
You're my girl, no no
Yeah

I know that you've been running 'round
With another man in town
Tried to put you right woman
But you keep on putting me down
Listen to me now, you're my girl, sing along, woohoo
You're my girl, oh yeah
You're my girl
Get in there
Yeah, woo
