1 ContributorAll Iâ€™ve Got LyricsLove, come to me
Oh love, look at me
Oh love can't you see
I'm so in love with you
I'm so in love with you
No one can stop the sun from shining
No one can stop the music from playing
No one can stop my heart from getting all I've got to you
My feelings for you
My thoughts to you
My music to you
No one can stop the earth from moving
No one can stop the lovers from loving
No one can stop my heart from getting all I've got to you
My body to you
My thought to you
All of my loving to you
(instrumental)
No one can stop the earth from flying
No one can stop the dreamers from dreaming
No one, ah no one, can stop my heart from getting all I've got to you
My days to you
My nights to you
All of my dreams to you
