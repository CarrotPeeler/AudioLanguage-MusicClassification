1 ContributorCan You Just Imagine LyricsCan you just imagine being buried alive?
Until you try it how can you tell?
Can you just imagine having breakfast at 5?
Until you try it how can you tell?
Did you put on a clever disguise?
Let the camera roll through your eyes
Can you tell it the way that it really is
And we did...we did...yeah yeah yeah yeah
Can you really imagine being there on the screen?
Until you try it how can you tell?
Do you understand that someone had to come clean?
It goes to show you never can tell
Did you put on a clever disguise?
Let the camera roll through your eyes
Can you tell it the way that it really is
And we did ...we did...did did did did
No you don't need to mention no names
There are some of us all just the same
Did you tell it the way that it really is
And we did ...oh yeah we did...did did did did
Did you realise that its not all rosy and gay
Until you tried how can you tell?
Well if your heart ain't in it better keep well away
Until you tried it how can you tell?

Let the camera roll through your eyes
Then you tell it the way that it really is
And we did ...oh yeah we did...did did did did yeah yeah yeah yeah
There's a sweet magnolia blossom round everybody's door
Do your friends keep eating possum?
Keep coming back for more
