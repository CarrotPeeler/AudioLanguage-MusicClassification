10 ContributorsHeartbreak Dream Lyrics
It's you and me
It's slow dancing to anything playing
It's us colliding
It's never finding when we should say when
I-I-I can feel it
When I look in your eyes so clearly
I-I can see that you need me
And all that we were
I-I can taste it
All the days that you've been wastin'
I-I know that you can't face them
And all that we were

In a moment
You were everything to me
In this moment
We're living in a heartbreak dream
We're living in a heartbreak dream

It's holding hands
It's making plans that we're never keeping
It's silent driving
It's always finding reasons to sleep in
Ah, ah, when you're near me
I'm yelling and you can't hear me
Can you feel me, and all that we were?
I-I can taste it
All the days that we've been wastin'
I know that you can't face them
And all that we were
You might also like
In a moment
You were everything to me
In this moment
We're living in a heartbreak dream
In a moment
You were everything to me
In this moment
We're living in a heartbreak dream
We're living in a heartbreak dream
We're living in a heartbreak dream

When you hold me, it feels like you don't know me
We are worlds apart
When you kiss me, I know you haven't missed me
You keep breaking my heart
You keep breaking my heart
You keep breaking my heart

In a moment
You were everything to me
In this moment
We're living in a heartbreak dream
We're living in a heartbreak dream
We're living in a heartbreak dream2Embed
