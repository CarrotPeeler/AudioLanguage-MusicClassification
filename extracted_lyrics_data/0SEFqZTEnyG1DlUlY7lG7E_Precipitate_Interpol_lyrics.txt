Been bad, Saturn makes your mind break in pieces
Been bad, so you cannot find the dimensions
But it will be around these spots that I've given to you
You will know that you'll breathe my vapors every time that you pass through this room

Pass through this room
Walk through my gloom
Daphne, you find me

Daphne, when you find me, let the blood drive and come and lie with me
Daphne, symmetry, you can't help but admire what a choice room this used to be

Bad, Saturn makes your mind break in pieces
Been bad, so you cannot find the dimensions
But it will be around these spots that I've given to you
You will know that you'll breathe my vapors every time that you pass through this room

Pass through this room
Walk through my gloom
Daphne, you find me
You might also like
Daphne, you find me to put you were inside use that for my memory
Daphne, symmetry, you can't help but admire what a choice room this used to be
Daphne, come as on display; will you find a way to draw the curtains of damp around your blushing ambition?
Blushing ambition
Blushing ambition
Blushing ambition

I found you inside my mind
I lost you inside my mind
I found you inside my mind
I lost you inside my mind

I was a child, I was a vice, a coyote, conditions, locations, facts
I was a child, I was a vice, a coyote, conditions, locations, facts
Erase them all perhaps
Erase them all
Erase them all perhaps
My own thing, my own thing

Now you're all that I have here
Now we can't remember
And you could fall back on lust when you've learnt to wait
They can be like the friends and neighbors you will get to appreciate, them
I have inside me some strange glow
I'm still enjoying this, that's why I made a mess
I'm still enjoying this, that's why I made a mess
That's why I made a messEmbed
