1 ContributorThe Way You Treat Me LyricsI'm alone
I try to understand why you go
Please take me in your arms tonight
To hear your breath
And hold me tight
And I go
To the place I should ignore
Believe me
Please
And come once more
To touch your breast
In the dark night
My latent dreams
I wish you were here
I feel the heat
In my hands again
The time had come
The game began
I payed for love
And we had fun
The night was long
Her face so bright
Her voice so strong
She holds me tight
You might also likeYou say
You'll never leave me
You say
You'll always need me
And the way you treat me
Is acceptableEmbed
