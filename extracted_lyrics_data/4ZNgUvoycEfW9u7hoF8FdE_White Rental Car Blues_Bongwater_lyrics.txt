2 ContributorsWhite Rental Car Blues Lyrics
...And ladies of the world cart (Yeah)
Now I want to tell you something about a cat by the name of Bobby Service
(Crazy)

Gonna rent me a rental car
Gonna drive out of town
Gonna rent me a rental car
Get the hell out of town
Gonna rent me a rental car
Gonna turn my life around
Let's make it a convertible
Let's put the top down

Gonna wake up in the morning
Gonna get up at the crack of dawn
No way I can sleep today
I got too much rubber to burn
Gonna leave the birds in the fireplace
And the cigarettes on the pie plates
Adult fun on the cable
Cool drugs on the table

You know I gotta ramble
You know I always gotta move
I gotta eat a peach and ramble on
'Til the lemon juice runs down real smooth
There's a dead deer on the highway
It's reminding me of you
And I think I'm getting too old for this
But I don't know what else to do
You might also like
So I got me a rental car
But what I really want is you
'Cause just like the lemon juice
I love the way you go down so smooth
I'll crawl on the floor of the rental car
And put your tongue right in the groove
Maybe I'm getting too old for this
But I don't know what else to doEmbed
