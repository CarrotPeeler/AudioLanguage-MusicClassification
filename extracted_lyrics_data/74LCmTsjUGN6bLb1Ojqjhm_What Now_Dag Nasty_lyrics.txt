4 ContributorsWhat Now? Lyrics
Silly boy
In over his head again
Silly boy
Doing his best again
Silly boy
Why don't you ever learn?
Oh, silly boy
You can't help getting hurt

(Behind us) Lying and hiding
(Behind us) The lying, the hiding
(Behind us) Lying and hiding
(Behind us) The lying and hiding

Silly boy
In over his head again
Silly boy
Doing his best again
Silly boy
Why don't you ever learn, why don't you, why don't you, why don't you, why don't you, why don't youâ€”
Silly boy
You can't help getting hurt
You might also like
(Behind us) Lying and hiding
(Behind us) The lying, the hiding
(Behind us) Lying and hiding
(Behind us) The lying and hiding

You know, I walked by you on the street the other day
You're going one way, I'm going the other
We both walked right by but we didn't say a word
We used to be this close, we used to be like brothers
But now, because of one time, one word, one phrase
It's all over!
It's all over!

(Behind us) Lying and hiding
(Behind us) The lying, the hiding
(Behind us) Lying and hiding
(Behind us) The lying and hidingEmbed
