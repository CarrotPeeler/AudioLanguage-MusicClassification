2 ContributorsAlphabet Street LyricsI'm going down to Alphabet Street
I'm gonna crown the first girl that I meet
I'm gonna talk so sexy
She'll want me from my head to my feet
I'm gonna drive my daddy's thunderbird
I'm gonna try but you know it's absurd
I'm gonna put her in the back seat
And drive her to Tennessee
I'm going down down down cause that's the only way
To make this cruel cruel world hear what we've got to say
Put the right letters together and make a better dayYou might also likeEmbed
