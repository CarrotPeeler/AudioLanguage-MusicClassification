1 ContributorGeorgia Rag LyricsDown on Atlanta on Harris Street
That's where the boys and gals do meet
Out in the alley in the street
Every little kid that you meet
Buzz all around like a bee
Shake it like a ship on the sea
Came all the way from Paris France
Come into Atlanta to get a chance
Grab your mama and hold her tight
Let's mess around the rest of the night
Grip your head way up high
Grab your daddy and make him cry
People come from miles around
Get in Dark Town to break them down
Down in dark town night and day
Trying to dance them blues away
Go all the way back to Newport News
Singing these doggone Atlanta bluesYou might also likeEmbed
