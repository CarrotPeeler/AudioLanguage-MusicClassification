1 ContributorMy Man Blues Lyrics
Honey, who was that man
I saw you with the other day?
That was my lovin’ daddy
The one they call Charlie Gray
Don't you know that's my man?
Yes and that's a fact
I ain't seen your name
Printed up and down his back
You, you’d better let him be
No, no
Go on old girl
Because you ain't talkin' to me
Old girl?
You heard me. Huh!
Well, that's my man
I want him for my own
No, no
He's my sweet daddy
You'd better leave that man alone
See that suit he got on?
I bought it last week
I've been buyin' him clothes for five years
Cos he that is my good lovin’ sheik
Girl, I’ve been lovin’ that man
For a long, long time
Well, you must be mistaken
Because the man is mine, oh, mine
You might also likeWell, I’m going downtown to find him
And bring him on home
Uh uh, girl you ain’t going nowhere
Because that man is mine alone
So what you wanna do ‘bout it, honey?
Well, I guess we got to have him
On cooperation plan
Well, you’re right
Yeah, I guess we have to have him
On cooperation plan
Well, it won’t seem nothin’ different
Because he’s just a two-timin’ man
No, it won’t seem nothin’ different
Because he’s just a two-timin’ man
Well, how about it?
Suits me!
Suits me!
Well alright thenEmbed
