They state that you play too loud
Well, baby, that's tough
They say that you've got too much
Can't get enough
They tell you that you look a fool
Oh, baby, I'm a fool for you
They say that your mind's diseased
Shaky stuff

And it's a rock 'n' roll damnation
Ma's own whippin' boy
Rock 'n' roll damnation
Take your chance, while you still got the choice

You state that you want respect
Honey, for what?
For everything that you done for me
Well, uh, thanks a lot
Come on, get up off your bended knees
You could set your mind at ease
My temperature's runnin' hot
Oh, I been waiting all night for a bite of what you got
You might also like
And it's a rock 'n' roll damnation
Ma's own whippin' boy
Rock 'n' roll damnation
Take a chance, while you still got the choice

Oh, it's a hard life

(Damnation) They're putting you down
(Damnation) All over town
(Damnation) 'Cause you're way out of reach
Livin' on the street, you got to practice what you preach

And it's a rock 'n' roll damnation
Ma's own whippin' boy
Rock 'n' roll damnation
Take your chance, while you still got the choice

(Damnation) You left a happy home
(Damnation) To live on your own
(Damnation) You wanna live in sin
(Damnation) It's a rock 'n' roll
(Damnation) Just too fond of the joy
(Damnation) You're a toy for a boy
(Damnation) You got dollars in your eyes
(Damnation) Always chasin' the pie in the sky
(Damnation) Rock 'n' roll
(Damnation)1Embed
