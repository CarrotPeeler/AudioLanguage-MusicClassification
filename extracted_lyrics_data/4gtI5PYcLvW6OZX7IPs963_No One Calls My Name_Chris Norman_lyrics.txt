1 ContributorNo One Calls My Name LyricsI wake up, I know you've gone
'Cause the nights are lonely
And days seem much too long
Since you left
No-one calls my name
Turn on the radio, it's your favourite song
Wonder if you're listening
And I wonder what went wrong
Since you've gone
No-one calls my name
And in your eyes
I could see the fire turning cold
Oh tell me lies
'Cause I just never wanted to be told
It's over
I wish you well I wish you health
I wish so many things
But I keep them to myself
'Cause now you're gone
No-one calls my name
And in your eyes
I could see the fire turning cold
Oh tell me lies
'Cause I just never wanted to be told
It's over
