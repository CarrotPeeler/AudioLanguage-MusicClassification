1 ContributorSanctified Woman LyricsI went lookin' for a sanctified woman
She was just the kind of woman I was hopin’ to find
I left home in the middle of December
She’s the only kind of woman could keep me in line
I found a girl just across the line in Georgia
She was livin’ by the highway in a pink doublewide
We left town in a 79 camaro
Had a bag full of nothin’ and a bottle of wine

Can’t you see me go up in flames
Can’t you hear me screamin’ your name
I need some redemption today
From that sanctified woman
I went back to my home in Alabama
Saw my Daddy in the driveway with a tear in his eye
He said “son, what you doin’ with that woman?”
Said I gotta keep on runnin’ ‘fore I run outta time

I don’t even know I don’t even know
What we’re gonna do where we’re gonna go
I don’t wanna know I don’t wanna know
Well we gotta go somewhere cause we sure ain’t got no homeSee Blackberry Smoke LiveGet tickets as low as $38You might also likeEmbed
