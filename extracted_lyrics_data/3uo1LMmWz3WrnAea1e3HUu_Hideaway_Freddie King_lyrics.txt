1 ContributorAin’t Gon’ Let the Blues Die LyricsHey something told me, keep the blues alive
I heard something told me, don’t let the blues die
Had Robert Johnson standing at the Crossroad (Crossroad)
We had the devil trying to buy his soul
A big price to pay to play the blues today
I said I ain’t gon’ let the blues die
We had Muddy Waters with the mojo hand
We had Jimmy Reed, the Big Boss Man
We had Howard King playing the blues for you
We had Koko Taylor pitching her Wang Dang Doodles
Said I ain’t gon’ let the blues die
We had Otis Redding Sittin’ at The Dock of The Bay (Yeah)
We had Ray Charles, tell me What’d I Say (Hit the Road Jack)
We had Freddie King playing the Hide Away
We had Howlin’ Wolf (Howlin’ Wolf) howling his blues away
Said I ain’t gon’ let the blues die
You had Big Mama Thornton with the Balls and Chain
We had John Lee Hooker, (Boogie) the Boogie Man
We had Junior Wells Messin’ With The Kid
All you legends look at what you did
I said I ain’t gon’ let the blues die
Oh I’m gon’ keep the blues alive
I said I ain’t gon’ let the blues die
Oh I ain’t gon’ let the blues die
Hey, hey, hey
I’m gon’ keep the blues alive
Said I ain’t gon’ let the blues dieYou might also likeEmbed
