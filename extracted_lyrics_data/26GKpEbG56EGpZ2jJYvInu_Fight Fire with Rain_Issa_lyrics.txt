1 ContributorCage of Lions Lyrics
Got this crazy feelin'
It's drivin' me insane
The world's had a lobotomy
And you're the ones to blame
Now my head is a tickin' time bomb
Just waitin' to explode
It's tempting just to let it burn
And swallow up the world

Tick, tick, tick, tick, boom
We'll make a little room
Tick, boom
I know I'm not alone

But we won't be the ones who start the fire
We'll simply be the water
After the floods comes the light, oh

We need to fix this soon
A little intervention
To raise this place from ruins
'Cause my mind is a cage of lions
Unable to be tamеd
The cause is all you sinners hеre
Who need to be restrained
You might also like
Tick, tick, tick, tick, boom
Let's make a little room
Tick, boom
I know I'm not alone

But we won't be the ones who start the fire
We'll simply be the water
After the floods comes the light
You will feel the depths of our desire
To get this world in order
Our finest hour will arrive

Ooh
Make a little room
Tick, boom
I know I'm not alone
Let the waser rise
And swallow all your lies
We'll remove your minds
And wait for things to dry
We will douse your flames
Remove your twisted games
Know that now's the time
You'll feel us start to rain
Now's the time to rise
We're sick of all your lies
Won't fight fire with fire
'Cause things won't ever change
We won't be the ones who start the fire
We'll simply be the water
After the floods comes the light
Oh, you will feel the depths of our desire
To get this world in order
Our time has come to change the world

Oh, boom
Make a little room
Tick, boom
I know I'm not alone
Boom
Make a little room
Tick, boom
I know I'm not alone
BoomEmbed
