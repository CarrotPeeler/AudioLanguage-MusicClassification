10 ContributorsOne Good Reason Lyrics
How could I be so dumb?
I wanted to believe someone
How could I be so dumb?
I wanted to believe someone (I shouldn't have)

Made the mistake of opening my mouth
I thought you'd understand but I guess that thinking doesn't count
Act all concerned? Well, sucks for me, man!
Can't wait to see where you'll be when it finally hits the fan

You tell me I
Shouldn't want to die
But can't give me
One good reason why

Whoa!

Oh, give it up and get out of my way
Don't bother patronizing me just 'cause you've got nothing to say
I've taken what you've told me, I was ready to apply
"Liars can't be trusted", man, but you're the one who lied!
You might also like
You tell me I
Shouldn't want to die
But can't give me
One good reason why

One time my spine
Controlled by your small mind
So many reasons
For what you've justified (don't kill yourself)

How could I be so dumb?
I wanted to believe someone
How could I be so dumb?
I wanted to believe someone

You tell me I
Shouldn't want to die
But can't give me
One good reason why
You tell me I
Shouldn't want to die
But can't give me
(You can't give me)
You can't give me
You can't give me
You can't give me
Give me
You can't give me
(Good reason)
One good reason
(Give me a good reason)
One good reason
(Give me a good reason)
One good reason
(Give me a good reason)
One good reason
(Give me a good reason)
One good reason
(Give me a good)
(Give me, give me, give me)
(Give me a good)
(Give me, give me, give me)
(Give me a good)
Argh!

(Good reason, a good reason)
(Give me a good reason, reason)Embed
