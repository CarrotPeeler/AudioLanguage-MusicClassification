4 ContributorsLove Enough Lyrics
Something goes wrong, something goes right
And it either punishes or strokes our pride
Never stop to think how much we lose
When we pick and chose in out solitude

Something comes up, something goes down
Suddenly you feel you're being pushed around
And just because you think you're losin' hold
You try to take control, the story's very old

But if we ever get our minds made up (Minds made up)
All we gotta do is love enough (Love enough)
Won't be long before it comes to you
Given love enough, you'll see it through
All you gotta do is love enough

Someone wants in, someone wants out
But doesn't anybody see beyond the clouds?
'Cause man you've hardly learned to speak your name
Before you're in this game
But, baby, all the same
You might also like
If we ever get our minds made up (Minds made up)
All we gotta do is love enough (Love enough)
Won't be long before it comes to you
Given love enough, you'll pull it through
All you gotta do is love enough

All you really gotta do is love enough (Love enough)
Won't be long before it comes to you
Given love enough, you'll see it through
All you gotta do is love enough
All you gotta, all you gotta do is love enough (Love enough)
Won't be long before it comes to you
Given love enough, you'll pull it through
All you gotta do is love enoughEmbed
