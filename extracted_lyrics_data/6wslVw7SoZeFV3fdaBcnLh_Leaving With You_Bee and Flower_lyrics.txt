4 ContributorsThe Coldest DC Comics Rap Ever!!!!! Lyrics
Yo, yo
I've been a little bit bored
Working on my new free album: "Demigod"
So I figured
I'll show y'all real quick
Why I'm a god in the nerd scene
When it comes to these bars
Can't nobody do it like me
It's like this:
Yo...

Red Hood
Holding on a bat, man
During the night of Robbin'
Cause both of my favorite gats jammed
Going in everyone's pockets
You're a Joker
And I'm hardly him
Ain't a thing funny, but you broads;
That's Harley Quinn
Now, riddle me this:
Who in Gotham is ill as me?
I'll put poison in your IV
I'm cold as mister freeze
Act Two-Faced
You won't be asked a question
You'll be laying Dead; Shot
These birds fly, they ain't Penguins
So you'll need a Clayface
To replace yours when I bring the pain
And your girl, I'll break her back
If I'm feeling Bane
She'll be wheel-chaired like Barbara
What I pack is legit
When I'll be done with that cat, woman
It won't revive in a Lazarus Pit
Ra's will tell you
I left Talia in fear, bro
She sees me and the bird gets running
Guess I Scare crows
Problem boy? Hush
Before I choose to let that Fire fly
Wearing a Black Mask
If you don't want to see me eye to eye
You a Killer Croc?
I'm known to leave the best choked
Armed with weapons
You'll never hear the cause of Death stroke
Check your Calendar, man
Y'all see I have to say
You'll be Solomon Grundy
Dead on a Saturday
Holding kryptonite for anybody here
Who's acting Super, -man, -boy or -girl
I'm harder than the suit on Lex Luthor
You riding the lowest lane
I'm a million steps and beyond
Leading my team like General Zod
You might also likeEverything I freaking spit's cold
You messing with a dog, baby;
Krypto
You a Parasite
I'm a Guardian with a hard flow
You take me as a prankster
I'll kill you so Bizzaro
Oh my, when I step in
I watch how the game reacts
Cause no one has ever witnessed
This kind of Brainiac
No need to Wonder, Woman
You ain't leaving with no portions of anything mine
I ain't giving you a ring like Hal Jordan
I'll be gone in a Flash
It'll be like you've never seen me before
Marriage; watch me go Chameleon, Boy
Holding Cold Steel
Watch who you Hawk, Man
You're looking at a Cyborg
I'm looking at a walkman
An Assassin out to take over the world
With a lot of plans
You'll swim with the fishes;
Say "hello" to Aquaman
When you reach Atlantis
He'll be seeing me soon
Once I finish overtaking the Legion of Doom
Play your cards right like Zatana
And you won't be in my line of fire
Don't; things will get more Shocking
Than a Live Wire
Going ape, Gorilla Grodd
Beating you down
And ain't leaving an Atom
The moment you witness a Star fire
Raving begins when the bars add up
To something Beast, Boy
You gon' have to give a damn about my presence
Cause it's passing that of Shazam, yeah
You're 'bout as yellow as the ring on Sinestro
I'm burning Swamp Thing
The people asking 'where my chest go?'
I'm Martian Manhunter, x-ray vision
I see marrow
Knowing where to target
If I team up with the Green Arrow
Battling me is an no-go, I'll
Film your death on my GoPro, so
Off the chain, I'm swinging my chain
I'll cycle away like Lobo, ya
Doomsday walking
I left, but I'm back spazzing
Untochable;
I make a sidekick of Black Adam
Mr. Manhattan's powers, but
Brooklyn was where I was born at
Growing, so I'm always changing
Like the face on Rorschach
Never been a Comedian
Sun down, I'm a Night Owl
Mind of Ozymandias
Looking for the right town
Expanding my vocabulary
Finding ways to think better
Who am I kidding?
I'm just laying off with Silk Spectre
Ares with the war
Raised to be a killer, dog
Cold enough to give frost bite
To Killer Frost
Give me BlackFire and Queen bee
For a date
Terra, Chesire and Cheetah
Can join in on the play
Heh, uh
The greatest thing in this Metropolis
Heh, your cause of joy or the apocalypse
Riding through Gotham
With no time to play with y'all
Kill me and I'll come back with a vengeance
I'm Jason toddEmbed
