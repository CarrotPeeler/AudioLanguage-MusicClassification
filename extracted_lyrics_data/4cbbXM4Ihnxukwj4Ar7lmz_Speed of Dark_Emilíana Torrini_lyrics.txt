I don't even know right now who we are
I see you standing on the stairwell, stairwell
You know that I am leaving
Oh, we used to live fast doing it, doing it
Every night the next touch knowing it, knowing it
How did we let it get that far
I don't even know right now who we are
We threw our hearts in a wishing well
Promised we'd never break the spell
I confess, I confess I have been tempted, tempted
I want it, I want it dangerous
Somebody tell me how we got that far
I don't even know right now who we are
And if you know that you're not breathing, get out
We can always just leave here, drive off
Life is just a flicker in the universe
Ooh, under the stars we're indestructible
Life is just a flicker in the universe
Ooh, under the stars we're indestructible
Won't somebody let me drive that car
We'll be riding down that freeway towards it all
We'll be making love under thunderstorms
Together living in a free fall
Come on, won't you come with me - we'll go farYou might also likeEmbed
