8 ContributorsShow Me the Way Lyrics
If I had to swim a river
Or climb a mountain tall
I'd do anything you ask
Anything at all

No river, no mountain
Can keep us apart
Show me the way, whoa, whoa, whoa, oh, oh
Show me the way to your heart

I would gladly cross a desert
To prove my love is true
I would sail the stormy sea
Just to be with you

No desert, no storm
Can keep us apart
Show me the way, whoa, whoa, whoa, yeah, yeah, yeah
Show me the way to your heart

If you ask for a palace
I'll build you two
If you ask me for dew
I'll bring stardust to you
Only you
You might also like
And if all you're asking
Is love in all its care
I will pledge true love to you
Love beyond compare

My darling, I need you
Why must we be apart?
Show me the way, whoa, whoa, whoa, oh, oh, oh
Show me the way to your heartEmbed
