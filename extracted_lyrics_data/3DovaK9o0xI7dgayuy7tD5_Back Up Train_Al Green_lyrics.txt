Back up, train
(Back up, train)
Turn it around
(Turn around)
I've got to take my baby (Got to take my baby)
Oh, wherever I'm bound

I'm (Roaming through this land)
Every day, baby, oh (Longing through this land)
I'm a lonely man
Just a lonely man
Need a helping hand
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Back up, train
(Back up, train)
But ease the pain
(Ease the pain)
Take me to my baby (Take me to my baby)
Oh, I'm going insane

So, mister conductor (Turn this train around)
All you gotta do now (Turn this train around)
Oh
Music in my hand
I`m a lonely man
Need a helping hand
Yeah, yeah
You might also like
So back this train up
That's all you gotta do now (Back up train)
I'll never forget the girl I left behind (Back up train)
Her tears, her kiss, her face stay on my mind
I got to make her say that she'll forgive me
I gotta get back, so, oh

Baby, baby, baby, baby
I need, I need your loving right now, darling
Oh (Back up train)
Woo, ooh
Oh I need my baby, mister conductor
Listen to me nowEmbed
