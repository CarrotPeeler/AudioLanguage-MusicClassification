3 ContributorsCarnival LyricsWhere in the world have you been?
It's as strange as I've ever lived
So you're coming along to the sideshow
I'll be falling all over like dominoes
For girls this sad in their eyes
They're all standing around being hypnotized
And walking me back to the firing line
You smile to get in the door
They can't keep it closed anymore
Tell your ma that you're gone to the freak show
I'm crawling all over the carnival
Just scratching a stitch in a skin
I'm moaning for more of the medicine
In the morning you're wondering where you've been
Just turning your back to the ghost
And trying to look like you just might know
That all of the good that you've seen
Just went down and into the drain
A kiss in the street is all for now
In the morning I'm gonna find it on out
What in the world can it be?
It's as strange as I've ever seen
You might also likeThe girls are dead in their eyes
Just standing around like they're hypnotized
Who'll follow me back to the freak show?
I'm crawling all over the carnival
And I am home
A kiss in the street is all for now
In the morning I wanna find it on out
What in the world can it be?
It's as strange as I've ever seen
The girls are dead in their eyes
Just standing around like they're hypnotized
Who'll follow me back to the freak show?
I'm crawling all over the carnival
And I am homeEmbed
