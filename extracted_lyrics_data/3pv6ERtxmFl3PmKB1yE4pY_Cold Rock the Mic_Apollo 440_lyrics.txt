6 ContributorsCold Rock the Mic LyricsThe supersonic boom should hit you in just a few seconds...
Woah!
Cold rock it
Cold rock the mic
Solar power, The new shape of motion
Causing a commotion
Hey, Hey, Hey, Hey
This is stealth sonic, Hydra-ponic
Hey yo man, Pull over!
Cold rock it
Cold rock the mic
Woah!
Hey, Hey, Hey, Hey
It's the new shape of motion
Hot wired, High powered version
Most automatic
Gonna park it in the pool, Yeah
The supersonic boom should hit you in just a few seconds...
