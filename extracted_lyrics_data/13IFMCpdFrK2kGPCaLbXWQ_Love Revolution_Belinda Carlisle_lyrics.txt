This is gettin' old, baby
Time for a real change
Time to turn our whole world around
'Cause I been getting restless now
Wondering what's up between you and me
Is gettin' me down
We've been hangin' on for far too long
Somehow everything went wrong
We're in a place we don't belong anymore

You know that it's true, baby
So I'll see you around
Just walk away until you can make
A love revolution (love revolution)
And come back to me
Just do whatever it takes
Whatever you need to make
A love revolution (love revolution)
For you, baby
For me, baby
I said love, love revolution
I said love, love revolution

I'm not afraid to change
Inside and out, baby
With or without you by my side
It's time to scream and shout
Let all these feelings out
Find out what's happening inside
Take away the borders inside your head
And you'll see other things instead
Realize the life we've led is all over now

You know that it's true, baby
So I'll see you around
Just walk away until you can make
A love revolution (love revolution)
And come back to me
Just do whatever it takes
Whatever you need to make
A love revolution (love revolution)
For you, baby
For me, baby
I said love, love revolution
I said love, love revolution
If we're gonna turn the world around
It's time that we get down to it
If we're gonna turn the world around
It's time that we get down to it
Now I know that there's another way
And I'm not waiting one more day
To make love revolution
For you baby, for me baby
And I wanna be around
When your walls come tumbling down
In a love revolution
A love revolution
