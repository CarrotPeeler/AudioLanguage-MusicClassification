4 ContributorsChristmas Through Your Eyes Lyrics
'Til I had you, I didn't know that I was missing out
Had to grow up and see the world through different shades of doubt
Give me one more chance to dream again
One more chance to feel again
Through your young heart
If only for one day, help me try

I wanna see Christmas through your eyes
I want everything to be the way it used to be
Back to being a child again thinking the world was mine
I wanna see Christmas, Christmas through your eyes

I see the rain, you see the rainbow hiding in the clouds
Never afraid to let your love show, won't you show me how?
Wanna learn how to believe again
Find the innocence in me again
Through your young heart
Help me find a way, let me try

Wanna see Christmas through your eyes
Want everything to be the way it used to be
Back to being a child again thinking the world was kind
I wanna see Christmas, Christmas through your eyes

I wanna see Christmas through your eyes
Want everything to be the way it used to be
Back to being a child again,, thinking the world was mine
I wanna see Christmas, Christmas through your eyes

Wanna see Christmas
Wanna see Christmas, wanna see Christmas through your eyes
Wanna see, wanna see Christmas
I wanna see, I wanna see Christmas through your eyes
I wanna see, I wanna see Christmas
I wanna see Christmas
I wanna see Christmas through your eyes
I wanna see Christmas
I wanna see Christmas through your eyesEmbed
