1 ContributorSeven Days LyricsSeven days, seven days
(Seven days, seven days)
And there's not a word from you
(And there's no word from you)
Seven days without love
(Seven days without love)
Tell me what am I to do
(Tell me what I'm to do)
Seven days I have cried
(Seven days I have cried)
How I long to feel your touch
(How I yearn for your touch)
Why'd you go, why'd you stray
(Why'd you go, why'd you stray)
When I loved you, oh, so much
(When I love you so much)
The phone won't ring at all
The clock is standing still
My tears are like the raindrops
Upon my windowsill
Seven days, lonely days
(Seven days, lonely days)
I have walked the floor for you
(I have walked the floor for you)

(Seven days, seven days)
Won't you please say you're still true
(And I wonder if you're true)
Seven days, seven days
(Seven days, seven days)
I have been in misery
(I have been in misery)
Seven days, lonely days
(Seven days, lonely days)
Darling, please come back to me
(Seven days, seven days)
Darling, please come back to me
(Darling, please come back to me)Embed
