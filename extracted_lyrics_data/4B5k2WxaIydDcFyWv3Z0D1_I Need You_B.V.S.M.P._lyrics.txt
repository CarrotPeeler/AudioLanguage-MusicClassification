6 ContributorsI Need You LyricsYo, hey, check this out!
Ah
I love you, baby
Oh
I want to sing a song, girl
I need you
Sha-na-na-na-na-na, baby
You're what I want
Oh girl
I need you
Sha-na-na-na-na-na, baby
You're what I want
Yo, hey, check this out!
What's it gonna take to get your attention?
You're keeping my mind hanging in suspension
I want you, that's what I'm trying to say
But for your love night and day I pray
Where have you been all of my life?
You're a perfect girlfriend and I want you for my wife
I'm after your heart, oh don't you see?
I'm not out to get your virginity
And I understand why you're playing hard to get
But for you, girl, I have all due respect
So don't reject, may I correct
Let me be the one that you select
You might also likeI need you
Sha-na-na-na-na-na, baby
You're what I want
Oh girl
I need you
Sha-na-na-na-na-na, baby
You're what I want
Oh girl
I want you
You're what I need
Oh baby
Yo' babe, check it out!
I never wanted nothing like I want you
I don't ask so much and you know that's true
I'm just telling you straight trying to be polite
When I met you it was love at first sight
I feel like I'm filling out an application
So read my resume, have no hesitation
Every time I see you, girl, I fall in love again
Wishing we could be more than just friends
I'll be there whenever you take a fall
We'll only have to live ever after all
No fussing or fighting we sing a song
If you were to cry I'll weep along
'Cause you're my girl and you shine like gold
You were hard to get but won't be hard to hold
I think about you from dusk 'til dawn
And the sound of your voice help me carry on
And that look in your eye it makes me weak
You're a quiet female, you hardly ever speak
May not be good at real romance
But I can do my best if I can get my chance
I need you
Sha-na-na-na-na-na, baby
You're what I want
Oh girl
I need you
Sha-na-na-na-na-na, baby
You're what I want
Oh girl
I want you
You're what I need
Oh baby
Yo, check it out!
Give me a chance to show and prove
Yo baby doll, don't front the move
I'm not like the other guys, I'm different
Like you, you know, I'm the innocent
I shouldn't tell you this but I keep urging
You might not believe it but I'm still a virgin
Do you want my love? I need to know
'Cause we're taking this situation too slow
Say yes and I'll keep a smile on your face
But if you say no I'll be gone without a trace
'Cause you are the one and you got my number
I dream about you when I'm deep in slumber
You should know that it's your love I need
And satisfaction is guaranteed
And you know why I want your love so much
'Cause I'm singing this song with a MC touch
I need you
You're what I want
I love you, baby, yeah
I need you
Gotta have you, baby
You're what I want
I want you
You're what I need
Oh baby
You were sent from heaven above
Sweet as a bee, soft as a dove 
You're what I want
Oh girl
I need you
I love you, I love you
You're what I want
I love you, baby, baby, baby
I want you
