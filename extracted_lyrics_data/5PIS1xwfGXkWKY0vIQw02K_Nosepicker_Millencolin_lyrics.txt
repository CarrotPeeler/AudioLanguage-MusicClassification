You pick your nose while I'm watching
And I'm quite impressed
If you pick again, pick one for your friends
They're leaving you, leaving you all alone
When you're in the mood to do the, stuff that you'll regret
When take a knife, it could end your life
What goes around always comes around
It's your nose that you're picking
It's your choice to pick your nose I think
It's gross to pick your nose like that in front of all your so called friends
But if it makes you feel better than this story's rather sad
Just let me tell you what I think
I think you really stink
You took my feelings and went away, stay away
Is it enough or do you want some more?
I will never open my door for you anymore
If you don't change your way, stay away
I don't want to ask you another question
About me and you
Because you don't care
You're acting like a square, is this fair?

But don't pick on me, I'm in your dreams in color
And I'll stay there for long
Forget the time, it's pointing at you
You must be bad, must be bad, must be rather sadEmbed
