6 ContributorsAll I Need Is Everything Lyrics
Tears just like the jewels adorn their corporate crown
Weigh on me worthless
And I shake them down and leave now
Have no royal things

You would consecrate the ground I paced in pain
And though those pavements caught your sorrow stains
They fall from me and I say
Maybe don't fall for anything
That says it's never gonna give you everything

I wish myself into your arms
To know that all I need is everything

The size of the sea and the sun in my eyes
And the line in my head
Yearning for more
Only for more
These days are as bright as the days I have seen
In the wildest of dreams
Yearning for more
Only for more
You might also like
I wish myself into your arms
To know that all I need is everything

Tears just like the jewels adorn their corporate crown
Weigh on me worthless
And I shake them down and leave now
Have no royal things

You would consecrate the ground I paced in pain
And though those pavements caught your sorrow stains
They fall from me and I say
Maybe don't fall for anything
That says it's never gonna give you everything

I wish myself into your arms
To know that all I need is everything

Hold back the night, I am tired of my sight
That won't see anymore
More than today
Threatening to stay
Hold back the night, I am tired of my sight
That won't see anymore
Show me you care
Show me the door
