1 ContributorDominator LyricsHe made a promise many years ago to break and scorch the land
He had a need for destruction and to bend us to the ground
He swore an oath: To bring us fear and pain
To never bend or rest until it's done, before he had become
The dominator, freedom hater
He will break us, crush our dreams
Amputator, lacerator
Spreading madness, mindless hate, dominate
Bringing everlasting pain
So many tragedies and years ago for you to understand
The devastation that he brought will leave a mark until the end
He swore an oath, to bring us fear and pain
To never bend or rest until it's done, before he had become
The dominator, freedom hater
He will break us, crush our dreams
Amputator, lacerator
Spreading madness, mindless hate, dominate
He walks alone
He'll put out our fire with scorn
He'll never rest, just enslave us
Destroyer of beasts and of man
Enforcer of madness and pain
He's sworn to break us, the dominator

I swore an oath, I will reverse his plan
I will restore, bringing power to the land, but the price is that I am
The dominator, freedom hater
I will bleed you, crush your dreams
Amputator, lacerator
Spreading madness, mindless hate, breathing pain
Born of hate, crush and break, annihilate, dominateEmbed
