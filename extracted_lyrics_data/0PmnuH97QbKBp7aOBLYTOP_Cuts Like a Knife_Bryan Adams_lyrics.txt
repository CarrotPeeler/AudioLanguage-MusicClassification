Drivin' home this evenin'
Coulda sworn we had it all worked out
You had this boy believin'
Way beyond the shadow of a doubt, Yeah
Well, I heard it on the street
I heard you might've found somebody new, Yeah
Well, who is he, baby?
Who is he and tell me what he means to you? Oh yeah!

I took it all for granted
But how was I to know
That you'd be letting go

Now it cuts like a knife!
But it feels so right
Yeah! It cuts like a knife
Oh, but it feels so right

There's times I've been mistaken
There's times I thought I'd been misunderstood, Ooo yeah
So wait a minute darlin'
Can't you see we did the best we could
Ooh, we could

Now you've thrown it all away
