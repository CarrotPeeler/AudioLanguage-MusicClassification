Didn't always have the best of times
One would win, both would lose
Tried to make believe the feelin's gone
Tried to make her into you
Within my heart I hear the truth
When the honesty shines through
'Cause...
Love's like a river
Flowing
Flowing forever long
And I will be there
I will, I will be there
Forever right or wrong
So here we are, the same old place
Wonderin' what to do
I'll be better in a safer space
Will I ever be with you
I swear my darlin'
This time I'll try
I'll make it up to you
'Cause
You might also likeLove's like a river
Flowing
Flowing forever long
And I will be there
I will, I will be there
Forever right or wrong
Right or wrong...
(guitar solo)
Love's like a river
Flowing forever longEmbed
