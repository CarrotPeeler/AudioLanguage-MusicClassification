Wash your face and hands
Get out of that bed
Wash your face and hands
Well, get into that kitchen
Make some noise with the pots and pans
The way you wear your dresses
The sun come shining through
The way you wear your dresses
The sun come shining through
I can't believe my eyes
All this belongs to you
I said shake, rattle and roll
I said shake, rattle and roll
I said shake, rattle and roll
I said shake, rattle and roll
Well, the more I work
The faster my money goes
(Yeah, roll them all)
I said over the hill
Way down underneath
I said over the hill, now
Way down underneath
You make me roll my eyes
And stomp by big, fat feet

I said shake, rattle and roll
I said shake, rattle and roll
I said shake, rattle and roll
Oh well, the more I work
The faster my money goesEmbed
