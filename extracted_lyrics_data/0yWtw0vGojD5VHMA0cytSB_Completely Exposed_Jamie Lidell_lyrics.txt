2 ContributorsCompletely Exposed LyricsI’ve been burning a hole in my shoes
Running from the mirrored you
Sometimes you can't face to be
Standing in your own reflection
I don't wanna be closed
But opening up has left me completely exposed
Tonight my cup is overflowin’
It's a stupid, sorry place I'm falling
Hot tears drippin’ down like coffee
Through it’s blackness I can see
Sometimes I can't face to be
Standing in my own reflection
I don't wanna be closed
But opening up has left me completely exposed
Please, please pull me out from under here
I've been down, down, down, down, down too long
Please, please pull me out again
I promise I'll be strong, strong this time
Opening up has left me completely exposed
I don't wanna be closed
Opening up has left me completely exposedYou might also likeEmbed
