Has once again surprised me
Oh destiny
Must want you here beside me
Quietly
Like the the sunrise with its splendor
Unexpectedly
With a passion strong yet tender
You draw me in
Like the moon draws the tide
Swept away by this love
Taken in by your eyes
Chorus:
If I had to walk away from you
I know that it would be no use
'cause you're so deep inside of me
Can't deny
I never want to be set free
The more you give the more I need
You can't change what is meant to be
No you can't change destiny
Destiny
Destiny
Speaks with many voices
So eventually
We're obliged to make some choises
Oh destiny
Who I thought I owned completely
Just to toy with me
Made me fall in love so deeply
You might also likeYou fill my soul
Like the stars fill the sky
Brought to life
This new world
Where i'm held captive inside
Chorus
If I had to walk away from you
I know that it would be no use
No you can't change destiny
Destiny
