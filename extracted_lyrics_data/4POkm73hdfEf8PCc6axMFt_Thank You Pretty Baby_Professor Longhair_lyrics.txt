1 ContributorThank You Pretty Baby (1971) Lyrics
I want to thank you pretty baby, for givin' your love to me, yes
I want to thank you pretty baby, for givin' your love to me
My heart was locked up till you came and set it free

I'm gonna love you pretty baby, love you till the end of time
Yes I'm gonna love you pretty baby, love you till the end of time
I wanna thank your folks too darling for making you so fine

Thank you for your loving ways
Thank you pretty baby for treating me so kind
I wanna thank your folks too baby for making you so fine

I'm gonna kiss you in the morning and kiss you in the evening, too
Woah oh, I'm gonna kiss you in the morning, kiss you in the evening, too
I'm gonna spend my life loving no one but you

Thank you for your loving ways
Thank you pretty baby for treating mе so kind
I wanna take my time and thank you darling, for being minе oh mine

I said I’ll kiss you every morning, kiss you every evening too
Kiss you every morning, kiss you every evening too
I'm gonna spend my life loving no one but you
I'm gonna spend my whole life loving no one but youYou might also likeEmbed
