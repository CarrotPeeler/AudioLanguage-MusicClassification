11 ContributorsI Do (Wanna Get Close to You) Lyrics
Yeah, uh-huh
Yeah, uh-huh (Uh)
Yeah, uh-huh (Uh)
Yeah, uh-huh (I like this)
Yeah, uh-huh (And another one)
Yeah, uh-huh (And another one)
Yeah, uh-huh (Bad Boy, baby)
Yeah, uh-huh (3LW, let's go)

Rolled up in the club like what
I got the V.I.P. on lockdown
Then I saw you starin' at me
Knew it was time to do my thang
You make me think that you're the one
Lickin' your lips at me for fun
While the DJ's makin' 'em sway
So, won't you come step to me if you

Wanna get down, baby?
I do, holla at me, baby
Ooh, if you're rollin' deep tonight
Then I do wanna know you, and if
You do wanna get down, baby
It's cool, holla at me, baby
Ooh, if your love is ridiculous
Then I do wanna get close to you
You might also like
Your ice, your gear, your sex appeal
Your game's so tight, you got me feenin'
Wanting you alone with me
That's the illest fantasy
You make me feel like wildin' out
Showin' you what it's about, yeah
Got it goin' on uptown
Now, let me see you work it out on me

Wanna get down, baby? (I do)
I do, holla at me, baby (Baby)
Ooh, if you're rollin' deep tonight (Rollin' deep)
Then I do wanna know you, and if (I want you)
You do wanna get down, baby
It's cool, holla at me, baby (Holla at me, baby)
Ooh, if your love is ridiculous
Then I do wanna get close to you (Oh, baby, I)

I see you and me together
Baby, how can I just make you see
I'm the only one you need?
So, please
Let me know right now (Let me know)
'Cause it's true ('Cause it's true)
I want you (I want you)
Say that you want me too, ah!
(Yeah, ladies and gentlemen!)
I know I could make you scream like a woman's supposed to
Seems like you wanna get closer
Well, boo, here's the ticket
Come through, we could kick it
My hundred twenty-five foot two is ridiculous
My view is the sickest
It's true, been convicted
I'm probably needin' a girl
In other words, ma, I'm due for some kisses, I'm due for some huggin'
And all them dudes, they be buggin', I ain't with it
Iâ€™m through with the thuggin', I'm due for some lovin'
I need a wife in my life
And, ma, you're lookin' like you're due for a husband
I choose not to love 'em
These chicks runnin' around actin' like straight fools in the public
Let's move with the subject
Because I came with a better plot
Just play the game and you'll never flop
It's in your brain, you already hot
But you ain't close to my age, so you better stop
Come on!

(Oh, baby, I)
Wanna get down, baby? (Wanna get down)
I do, holla at me, baby
Ooh, if you're rollin' deep tonight (Deep tonight)
Then I do wanna know you, and if (Whoa)
You do wanna get down, baby (It's cool)
It's cool, holla at me, baby (Oh, oh)
Ooh, if your love is ridiculous (So ridiculous)
Then I do wanna get close to you
Wanna get down, baby?
I do, holla at me, baby (Say it again, s-say it, say it again)
Ooh, if you're rollin' deep tonight
Then I do wanna know you, and if (Say it again, say it again, oh)
You do wanna get down, baby
It's cool, holla at me, baby (Say it again, s-say it, say it again)
Ooh, if your love is ridiculous
Then I do wanna get close to you (Wanna, wanna get close to you)
Let's go, don't stop
Let's go, don't stop
Ha, ha
Yeah
Yeah
Uh-huh, uh-huh
I like this one right here
Come on
Hah, hah
Hah, hah
Hah, hah
Yeah, hahEmbed
