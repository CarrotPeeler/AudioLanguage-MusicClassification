This that ghetto club R&B
They heard this before
Yall get ready

It ain't everyday when I say who that
Impressing me is kinda hard but you did that
You got me curious to see where you at
Which you game when I see can you get that
If so then good news you qualify
To get something you ain't never had in your life
A little bit heaven you'll hear the angels singing
This stuff is so good you'll throw it up and
Watch it turn in to sunshine

Yup it's like that
You never had it like this
If you ever get some of this sunshine
Make it rain money all fa my honey
You'll find nane nother this fire, this hot
Burning up the block
Not a nane nother one not a nane nother one
This good this good the best in the hood
Not a nane nother one
No love like min that can turn into sunshine
See Fantasia LiveGet tickets as low as $55You might also like
When I say it boy I mean it
When it come out it brighten up your day boy I promise 
When you go it down you go along with it
Gotta stay all night till dawn hope you get it
If so then good news you qualify
To get something you ain't never had in your life
A little bit heaven you'll hear the angels singing
This stuff is so good you'll throw it up and
Watch it turn in to sunshine

Yup it's like that
You never had it like this
If you ever get some of this sunshine
Make it rain money all fa my honey
You'll find nane nother this fire, this hot
Burning up the block
Not a nane nother one not a nane nother one
This good this good the best in the hood
Not a nane nother one
No love like min that can turn into sunshine

Watch the rays from the sun get the money
I shine so bright thats why you want me
I know
The sun make it grow, the sun make it grow, the sun make it grow
I throw it up (throw it up)
Watch the rays from the sun get the money
I shine so bright thats why you want me
I know
The sun make it grow, the sun make it grow, the sun make it grow
You'll throw it up and Watch it turn in to sunshineEmbed
