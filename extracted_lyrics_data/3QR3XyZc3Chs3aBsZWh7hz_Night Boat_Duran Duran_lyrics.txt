10 ContributorsNight Boat Lyrics
Standing on the edge of a quay
Low lights flashing on the water for me
Fogging my mind darkens in my eyes
Silently streaming for a distant sound
Ripple river yellows
Rising for a breath of breeding and drowns
Stillness overcomes me in the night
Listen to the rising water moan

I'm waiting
Waiting for the night boat, woah!
I'm waiting
Waiting for the night boat

Shudders all through me, shudder away
Echo me, echo me (Echo me...)
Am I alone, or is the river alive?
'Cause it echoes me, echoes me, echoes me

I'm waiting
Waiting for the night boat, woah!
I'm waiting
Waiting for the night boat

Waiting
Waiting for the night boat, woah!
I'm waiting
Waiting for the night boat
Waiting for the night boat, woah!
I'm waiting
Waiting for the night boat

I'm waiting for the night boat4Embed
