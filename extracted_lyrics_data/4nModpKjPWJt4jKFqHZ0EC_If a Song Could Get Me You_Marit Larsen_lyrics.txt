I could try with the waltz
I could try rock 'n' roll
I could try with the blues
If a song would do
I could sing it high or low
When I let you go, you know
I thought it was for the best
Now it is so obvious

So here it is, here it goes
I could try it rock 'n' roll
A change-your-life-forever tune
If a song could get me you
I could make it high or low
Sing it on the radio
If that is what I need to do
If a song could get me you

I could run for miles and miles
I'd take off and I'd start flying
I could cross land and sea
If you'd just believe me
I should not have hurt you so
This old house is not a home
Without you here, there's no use
I've got no time left to lose
You might also like
So here it is, here it goes
I could try it rock 'n' roll
A change-your-life-forever tune
If a song could get me you
I could make it high or low
Sing it on the radio
If that is what I need to do
If a song could get me you

If a song could get me through
I'd sing my way right back to you
Tell me how to make it right
Tell me now, I'll start tonight
I know I could make it last
I swear to you that if I knew
What I was getting myself into
I wouldn't answer to my fears
I'd never leave you standing there
Just look at me
If you'd only see me
I would prove my love for you
I could swallow half the moon
Just tell me where, tell me when
I will have you back again
Yeah
So here it is, here it goes
I could try it rock 'n' roll
A change-your-life-forever tune
If a song could get me you
I could make it high or low
Sing it on the radio
If that is what I need to do
If a song could get me you
So here it is, here it goes
I could try it rock 'n' roll
A change-your-life-forever tune
If a song could get me you
I could make it high or low
Sing it on the radio
If that is what I need to do
If a song could get me youEmbed
