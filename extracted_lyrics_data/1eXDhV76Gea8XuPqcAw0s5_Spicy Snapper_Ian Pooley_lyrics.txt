4 ContributorsEvery Hour Lyrics
Bing bong! (Statik Selektah)
"Trillstatik 2"
Welcome to New York City
Or as I like to call it "Nems York City"
If you come out here
And you don't see me, you pussy
Don't ever disrespect me, you heard?
Let's go

Shut the fuck up, your bars is ass
And that clothing line you got, throw that shit in the trash
Don't nobody wanna rock that shit
You hear shorty in the background (Pop that shit)
Ah, now back to the regular schedule
Moved pounds of weed and it never was medical
Walk through your hood, take a shit on your pedestal
Pop your tape in and that shit was hysterical
I talk spicy like a can of wasabi
Bring whoever you want, your man'll get bodied
They'll hold his fucking vigil in a candlelit lobby
And I move through the city in a camel Denali
Ah, you know my body, I'm the type to get crazy
Leave you up in smoke like a flight in the 80s
Homie, you ain't tough, you just frighten the ladies
Cause you wild pussy like a tiger with rabies, ah!
Fuck your life, you heard?
You might also like
Goddamn, who let this crazy motherfucker in here from Coney Island?
Statik, get that motherfucker back on the train outta here
I'm in there tryna do some real shâ€“
You know what? Fuck it, leave his ass here, he already here
Goddamnit, that's how we actin' today?
Fuck it, that's how we actin' today
"Trillstatik 2", fuck you niggas, let's go

Hold up, this ain't a motherfuckin' smooth song
You know the routine, move or you gettin' moved on
Holdin' my block down so long, my toes hurt
Don't make me smack the shit out your boy until his nose squirt
I woke up and chose violence
And you know I'ma make your fire dance when I apply the hand
You waited too late to run away
So here's what's gon' happen: I'ma shoot you to five and put the gun away
Now that's the best that I could do for ya
Leave your face a little black and blue for ya, no matter who saw ya
After that, when they see him, they won't want their bastard back
It was game over when I told, "Statik, blast the track"
And matter fact, nigga, it matters not
When the shotty shoot the scattershot and leave your bladder pop
Always first like aardvark in the dictionary
Master your addiction on your pictures and obituaries
Now that's what the fuck I'm talkin' about, "Trillstatik 2"
This is that Houston, Brooklyn shit, Gorilla Nems
Ayo, Bun, hold up
Let's take it to that classic New York City mixtape shit
The god right here, what up, Pap?
(Statik Selektah to bring the break in)
Pa-poose, Pa-poose

When I write a rhyme at night, I fall asleep and I explore
When I wake up, I see words that I ain't see the night before
On fire tracks, inspire cats, I attack like some type of dog
You'll get bitten by my written, I bite with a sniper's jaw
Some type of actor, you not the type of rapper that I adore
Cut your shit, you such a bitch-sucking dick like some type of whore
To the death of me, rebel who slept with the weapon directedly
Kept a Heckler next to me, met with every discrepancy
Several legends respected the hectic level I rap
If a peasant never resented, I'd check his temperature definitely
Stop going live from your location, they could see you
The murderers, they gon' pull up and leave you
The 'Gram pay you to go live, don't let them deceive you
Pay attention, cause live spelled backwards is evil
Shout to Bun and Statik, these niggas don't want no rhymes from us
I be with the wolves, I'm from the jungle like Nas brotherEmbed
