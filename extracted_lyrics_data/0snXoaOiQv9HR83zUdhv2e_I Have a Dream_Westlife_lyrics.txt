20 ContributorsI Have a Dream Lyrics
I have a dream
A song to sing
To help me cope
With anything

If you see the wonder
Of a fairytale
You can take the future
Even if you fail

I believe in angels
Something good in everything I see
I believe in angels
When I know the time is right for me
I'll cross the stream
I have a dream (Oh yeah)

I have a dream (Have a dream)
A fantasy (Fantasy)
To help me through (Help me through)
Reality (Reality)
You might also like
And my destination (Destination)
Makes it worth the while
Pushing through the darkness (Through the dark)
Still another mile (Another mile)

I believe in angels
Something good in everything I see
I believe in angels
When I know the time is right for me
I'll cross the stream (Cross the stream)
I have a dream

I have a dream (Woah yeah)
A song to sing (Song to sing)
To help me cope (Help me cope)
With anything (Anything)

If you see the wonder (If you see the wonder)
Of a fairytale (Of a fairytale)
You can take the future
Even if you fail (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I believe in angels
Something good in everything I see (Everything)
I believe in angels (Angels)
When I know the time is right for me (Right for me)
I'll cross the stream
I have a dream (I have a dream)
I'll cross the stream (Cross the stream)
I have a dream
