2 ContributorsIf I Had a Million LyricsIt's a very fine line, babe
Between you and me
Between you and I
And I crossed it many times
Mmh
Still you're mine babe
Still you're mine
So if I had a million
If I had a million
Yeah
You would have a million too
You would have a million too
So when it comes to payback
Mmh
I'ma pay you back babe
I'll be paying for
Cause i ain't scared no
I ain't scared of a little manual labor
Work it off and so
If I had a million
If I had a million
Yeah
You would have a million
Mmh
You would have a million too
Yeah
You would have a million too
