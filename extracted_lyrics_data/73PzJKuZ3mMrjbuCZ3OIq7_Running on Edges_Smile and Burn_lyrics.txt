1 ContributorRunning On Edges LyricsShaking out the medicine
So I can love myself today
Love myself today
Depending on my medicine
So I can love myself today
Love myself today
Everything this light 
I have always been this way
Year after year after year after year
Taking all for granted
That you can love yourself today
All love without care
Walking on fire
Running on edges
This is what we know
This is what we
And you can see me fail
And you can see me fail
I wonder if you seen it
I went back up in flames
And I'm not still the same
Down  going down the 
I can love myself to death
Love myself to death

This is what we know
This is what we
And you can see me fail
And you can see me fail
And you can see me fail
Walking on fire
Running on edges
This is what we know
This is what we
And you can see me fail
And you can see me fail
Walking on fire
Running on edges
This is what we know
This is what we
And you can see me fail
And you can see me fail
And you can see me fail
And you can see me failEmbed
