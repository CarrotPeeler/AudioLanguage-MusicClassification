Dirt by any other name
Wouldn't have a taste so sweet
Tell me, do I take the blame?
Or should I admit defeat?
Or go blind
Or go blind

Twisting, falling through the air
Will there be another day?
Gone so long you couldn't care
I hang my head down anyway
And go blind
And go blind

Dirt by any other name
Wouldn't have a taste so sweet
Tell me do I take the blame?
Or should I admit defeat?
Or go blind
Or go blindYou might also likeEmbed
