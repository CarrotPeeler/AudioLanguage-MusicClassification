Truth serves them embrace
And defend her case
Part flattery, part threats
"For those who cling to this dominion
Will partake in its fall"

With his silence
He passes the judgement over them
"With your feverish signs of force
You'll make them and yourself to believe
That he still retains his full power"

As a platform for divine foundations
You want to...
As a platform for divine foundations
You want to...
You want to make them suck

Shallowness and beauty
Was all that concerned her body
But the soul, but divine guest
Were thrust to the bottom
You might also like
Surrendered to the sect
That has risen from its womb
"For those who cling to this dominion
Will partake in its fall"

As a platform for divine foundations
You want to...
As a platform for divine foundations
You want to...
You want to make them suck

Shallowness and beauty
Was all that concerned her body
But the soul, but divine guest
Were thrust to the bottom
Shallowness and beauty
Was all that concerned her body
But the soul, but divine guest
Were thrust to the bottomEmbed
