10 ContributorsRemember (Walking in the Sand) Lyrics
Seems like the other day
My baby went away
She went away 'cross the sea
It's been two years or so
Since I saw my baby go
And then this letter came for me

It said that we was through
She found somebody new
Oh, let me think, let me think
What shall I do?

Oh, no
Oh, no
Oh, no no no no no

(Remember) Walking in the sand
(Remember) Walking hand in hand
(Remember) The night was so exciting
(Remember) Her smile was so inviting
(Remember) Then she touched my cheek
(Remember) With her fingertips
(Remember) Softly
Softly we met with a kiss
You might also like
Whatever happened to
The girl that I once knew?
The girl that said she'd been true
Oh, whatever happened to
That night I gave it to you?
What will I do with it now?


Oh, no
Oh, no
Oh, no no no no no

(Remember) Walking in the sand
(Remember) Walking hand in hand
(Remember) The night was so exciting
(Remember) Her smile was so inviting
(Remember) Then she touched my cheek
(Remember) With her fingertips
(Remember) Softly
Softly we met with a kiss
Whatever happened to
The girl that I once knew?
The girl that said she'd been true
Whatever happened to
That night I gave it to you?
What will I do with it now?1Embed
