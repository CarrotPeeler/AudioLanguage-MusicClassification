3 ContributorsAlone Again Lyrics
Where's the girl who I once knew?
Is she still a part of you?
Will she ever get back on the ride?
Dreamin' just to be some sucker's wife?
All alone, baby, I'm gettin' so excited
You can tell, 'cause I just can't hide it

When you say it's overblown
You'll never be alone again
You're alone again
You're alone again
When you say you'll never be alone
You'll never be alonе again
You're alone again
You're alonе again
You're alone again

Christmas blues 'til the end of time
Scarin' her, have her half a glass of wine
Thought you'd hide where you couldn't be seen
In the pages of some filthy magazine
All alone, baby, I'm gettin' so excited
You can tell 'cause I just can't hide it
You might also like
When you say it's overblown
You'll never be alone again
You're alone again
You're alone again
When you say you'll never be alone
You'll never be alone again
You're alone again
You're alone again
You're alone againEmbed
