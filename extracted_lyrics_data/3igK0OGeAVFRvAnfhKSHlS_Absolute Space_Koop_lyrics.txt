2 ContributorsAbsolute Space LyricsPeacefully
I close my eyes
To get a better view
No need for words now
No need for words
While I never come closer
Whispering
Whispering softly
I try to get close
There's a place
Behind this view
While I never come closer
No I never come closer
To where I wanna be
There's no space
Left for me
But I never come closer
But I never come closer
But I never come closer
But I never come closer
But I never come closer
But I never come closerYou might also likeEmbed
