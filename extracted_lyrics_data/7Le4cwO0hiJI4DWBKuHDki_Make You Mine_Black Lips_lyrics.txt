5 ContributorsMake You Mine Lyrics

Waking up
You hit the ground running
As long as all the plastic  the river streams keep on flowing
You're leaving town
It's a brand new day
 while those wheels keep on turning

I need a little loving tell me everything will be alright
You showed  and I'm coming home (home) tonight
Gonna make you make you mine

Gimme your sign
Or call me up some time tomorrow
I wish you would, and hold on tight
 been throwing down while having fun out on a Saturday night
