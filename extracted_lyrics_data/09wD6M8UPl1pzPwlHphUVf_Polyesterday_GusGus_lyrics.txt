3 ContributorsPolyesterday Lyrics
I am the paper above the skyscraper
They tried to rape her, she couldn't reach higher
I am the paper above the skyscraper
They tried to rape her, she couldn't reach higher

Polyesterday, found another way
Polly said today, she'd find another way tomorrow

In public, public, they said she was sick in Buick, Buick
Driving naked for an hour, stark naked

Polyesterday, found another way
Polyesterday, synthetic one way or the other


Polyesterday, found another way
Polly said today, she'd find another way tomorrowYou might also likeEmbed
