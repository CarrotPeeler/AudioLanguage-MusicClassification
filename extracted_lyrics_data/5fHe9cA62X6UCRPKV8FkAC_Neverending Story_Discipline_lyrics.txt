5 ContributorsArms Race Lyrics
(Blame Swagg for this motherfucker)
(Flexin' on that bitch, hold up)

I make this Glock here go berserk, it's painful 'cause these bullets hurt
Told my label double my advance 'cause I know what I'm worth
Niggas act like bitches, all they like to do is talk and chirp
Told my youngsters, "Spin them niggas tonight, I hope your fingers work"
I hope you don't think being broke is cool cause that shit lame as fuck
My stick had jammed on me the other day, I had to lube it up
Hope you don't think you taking somethin', I wish you would attempt
Thinkin' that he finna catch me loafin', he must be on fent'

It's an arms race, the circle got more sticks than North Korea
Tryna open up my mind, I'm geekin' off of Golden Teachers
Used to break in houses, but I scammed my way to hundreds of thousands
Learned to trap on Snapfinger, I watched my cousin weigh up ounces
Nigga can't even look me in the eye, know it's bitch in him
Treat that nigga like he got bad behavior, you know we switchin' him
My clip like a never-ending story when that extension in
Nigga keep fallin' off, boy, stack them racks and get some discipline
Told my son, "Don't let no lil nigga try you, lil boy, handle business"
We ain't worried 'bout a fuckin' thing, we keep them Draco killers
Voices in my head keep tellin' me 'bout more artillery
I ain't tensin' up, that's on my kids I'm squeezin' instantly

I make this Glock here go berserk, it's painful 'cause these bullets hurt
Told my label double my advance 'cause I know what I'm worth
Niggas act like bitches, all they like to do is talk and chirp
Told my youngsters, "Spin them niggas tonight, I hope your fingers work"
I hope you don't think being broke is cool cause that shit lame as fuck
My stick had jammed on me the other day, I had to lube it up
Hope you don't think you taking somethin', I wish you would attempt
Thinkin' that he finna catch me loafin', he must be on fent'Embed
