3 Contributors99 Red Balloons Lyrics
You and I in a little toy shop
Buy a bag of balloons with the money we've got
Set them free at the break of dawn
'Til one by one, they were gone
Back at base, bugs in the software
Flash the message, "Something's out there"
Floating in the summer sky
99 red balloons go by

99 red balloons floating in the summer sky
Panic lights, it's a red alert
There's something here from somewhere else
The war machine, springs to life
Opens up one eager eye
Focusing it on the sky
99 red balloons go by

99 Decision Street, 99 ministers meet
To worry, worry, super-scurry
Call the troops out in a hurry
This is what we've waited for
This is it boys, this is war
The President is on the line
As 99 red balloons go by
99 red balloons go by
As 99 red balloons go by
You might also like
99 dreams I have had
Every one, a red balloon
It's all over, I'm standin' pretty
In this dust that was our city
If I could find one souvenir
Just to prove the world was here...
Here it is, a red balloon
And I think of you and let it go1Embed
