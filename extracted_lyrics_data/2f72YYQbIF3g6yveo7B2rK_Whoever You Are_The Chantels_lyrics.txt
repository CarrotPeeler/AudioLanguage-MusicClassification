1 ContributorWhoever You Are Lyrics
Whoever you are
Wherever you may be
There's someone whoâ€™ll really love you
Please wait and see
Whoever you are (whoever you are)
Whoever you are (whoever you are)
Whoever you are (whoever you are)
Whoever you are (whoever you are)

Dry those tears
There's no need for crying
I'm sure your lover
Will soon come to find you
Whoever you are (whoever you are)

When God made Adam, Adam and Eve
He also made a lover, a lover for you and a lover for me
So don't fret, wait patiently
For soon a love will hit you the way it hit me

Whoever you are
Wherever you may be
There's someone who will love you
Please wait and see
Whoever you are (whoever you are)
You might also likeOoo (whoever you are)
Ooo (whoever you are)
Ooo (whoever you are)
Ooo (whoever you are)
Ooo (whoever you are)
Ooo (whoever you are)
Ooo (whoever you are)Embed
