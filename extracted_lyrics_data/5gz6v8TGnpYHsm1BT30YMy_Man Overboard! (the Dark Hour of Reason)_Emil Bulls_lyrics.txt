3 ContributorsMan Overboard! (The Dark Hour Of Reason) LyricsIn the dark hour of reason
Another one bit the dust
From his ashes a new flame shall rise
Rear the spark to a flame let it grow to a fire feed it up
Feed it heed it to a roaring blaze
I try to take it easy but
This battle never seems to end
It hit me harder than you will ever know
Man overboard!
Another one had to depart
May his blood not be shed in vain
Breathe life into the frozen wasteland of the abandoned souls
Over and over and over again
I try to take it easy but
This battle never seems to end
It hit me harder than you will ever know
Man overboard!
You've gotta be a climber to rise above defeat
Still I try to overcome vertigo
Another one dead and gone
