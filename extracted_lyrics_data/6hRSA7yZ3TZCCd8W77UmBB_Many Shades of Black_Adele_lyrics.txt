7 ContributorsMany Shades of Black LyricsGo ahead
Go ahead, smash it on the floor
Take whatever's left
And take it with you out the door
See if I cry
See if I shed a single sorry tear
Can't say that it's been that great
No, in fact, it's been a wasted, worried year
Everybody sees
And everyone agrees
That you and I are wrong
And it's been that way too long
Take it as it comes
And be thankful when it's done
There's so many ways to act
And there's many shades of black
There's so many shades of black
There's so many shades of black
Let it out
Let it all out, say what's on your mind
You can kick and scream and
Shout and say things that are so unkind

See if I stand firm or if I fall
'Cause in the back of my mind and on the tip of my tongue
Is the answer to it all
And everybody sees
And everyone agrees
That you and I are wrong
And it's been that way too long
Take it as it comes
And be thankful when it's done
There's so many ways to act
And there's many shades of black
There's so many shades of black
Yeah, there's many shades of black
Everybody sees
And everyone agrees
That you and I are wrong
And it's been that way too long
So take it as it comes
And be thankful when it's done
There's so many ways to act
And you cannot take it back
No, you cannot take it back
Yes, there's many shades of black
There's so many shades of black
Yeah, there's many shades of black
There's so many shades of black
There's so many shades of black
Yeah, there's many shades of black
There's so many shades of black
And there's many shades of black
There's so many shades of black
