2 ContributorsI Shut Doors And Windows LyricsOh, my god, it's been ages
Look at you now
I've read about you
This place still looks the same
Down to the drunks and homeless ones
Well, you know how it is
I should be leaving
I am fine, I am fine
I shut doors and windows
And sleep for days
A familiar face without meaning
Nowhere lost
Someone set fire to
The place I used to call my home
Soon everyone is back for Christmas break
Counting victims
And what measure do you use on your old friends?
Oh, success!You might also likeEmbed
