3 ContributorsSpoilt LyricsWhen I look into your big brown eyes
I see no one there I can despise
When I see deep in your soul
I feel so safe just holding on
But they tell me that it's okay
That they're raping lots of women every single day
Blowing away all the children
If they were yours what would you do?
I want to know
Why are you so spoiled
I want to know
Why are you so spoiled
Painfully I watch the sunspots fade
My home is gone my body decayed
I'm seconds away from all of you
When we meet again what will you do?
Our eyes are burnt now we can't see
Our hands are scorched we cannot feel
The war is ours and now you know we're all to blame
It's such a shame
I want to know
Why are you so spoilt
I want to know
Why are you so spoilt
You might also likeNever seen a war in my country
Never watched my sisters die
Never felt a burn of Nepalm
Never lost my hair to a flame of destiny
Don't drink the milk it's spoiled
Don't breathe the air it's spoiled
And don't step on the grass, Sam, it's spoiled!
In the red red acid rain
And in and out of our remains - spoiled
I'm once removed, I'm twice removed
I'm so removed from the pain
So I remain spoiled spoiled
So I stay wrapped in your womb
So safe so safe inside your room
Holding on and holding on and holding on and on and on
I want to know
Why are you so
I want to know
Why are you so
I want to know
Why are you so
I want to know
Why are you so
Spoiled!Embed
