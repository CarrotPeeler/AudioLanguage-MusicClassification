1 ContributorMelodramatic Meadows Lyrics
You found a box of gold and you threw it out the window
Rusting all of what was sublime
She’s grown out her melodramatic meadows when she once was so mellow
Guide me to why you’ve done a crime
She was replaced by someone without a face
She looks at herself in the mirror
Can you hear her?

Rain all over the ground
From the thunder that you had laid down

Let it rest because at its best
You won’t ever be on speaking terms again
So soothе your voice, but don’t rejoice
‘Causе you might not find another then

You’ve fallen from grace faster than a blink of my eye
Don’t want you to go singing “No Woman, No Cry”
She wants you out of her life
Make this your last goodbye
Even though you’ll be gone
She’ll be better off as one
You might also like
Rain all over the ground
To make a pool deep enough to drown in
Rain all over the ground
From the thunder that you had laid down

Let it rest because at its best
You won’t ever be on speaking terms again
So soothe your voice, but don’t rejoice
‘Cause you might not find another then

She won’t take excuses, so how in the deuce is this gonna take redemption?
No one will give subvention ‘cause we’re past the point of prevention
So break the tension

Let it rest because at its best
You won’t ever be on speaking terms again
So soothe your voice, but don’t rejoice
‘Cause you might not find another thenEmbed
