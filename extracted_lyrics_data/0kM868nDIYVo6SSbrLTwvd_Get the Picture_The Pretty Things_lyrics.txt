3 ContributorsOne by One Lyrics
I don't miss you anymore
The feeling's gone, won't kill the pain
There's a time, can't stand up to you
Ain't throwing stones at your window
So I can bring us back to life
Live the life, face the truth
Yesterday I got over you

One by one, two by two
I took a picture of you
I held it up to the light, yeah
Not my fault what you said
Can't get you out of my head
You get the best of my life

It took forever to get home
Down that road I walked alone
It's a lie to face the truth
Yesterday I got over you

One by one, two by two
I swear whatever I do
We're heading into the light, yeah
Not my fault what you said
Can't get you out of my head
You get the best of my life
You might also like
Just like the rain on a summer's day
Blindfold your eyes and walk away
All the pretty things you made me say
One by one

One by one, two by two
I took a picture of you
I held it up to the light, yeah
Not my fault what you said
Can't get you out of my head
You get the best of my life

One by one, two by two
I took a picture of you
You get the best of my life
You get the best of my lifeEmbed
