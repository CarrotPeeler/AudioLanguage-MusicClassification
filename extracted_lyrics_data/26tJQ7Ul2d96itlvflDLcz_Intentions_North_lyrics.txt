2 ContributorsIntentions LyricsI was sitting in the back of class
Tryna figure how to start
First thing you need to know
All this shit comes right from the heart
These some unmediated meditations
Me to you, direct connection
I'm done throwin' up walls
No condom on, yeah you know that imma hit it raw
Doors wide open for the light to shine
It's tough to keep 'em open all the time
But now they’re open so come in and look around
Didn’t clean up cause I knew you were in town
So let's get down
Let's get it goin'
Talkin' for a while
Now imma show it
Look, I'm tryna show you me, who I really am
Empty out my head, in some iambs
And I worry that the words won’t do justice
But that's all that we’ve got, so I'll just trust it
Just trust it
