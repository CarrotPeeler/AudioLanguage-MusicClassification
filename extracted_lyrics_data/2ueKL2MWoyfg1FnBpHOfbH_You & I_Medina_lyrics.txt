8 ContributorsYou & I Lyrics
Nothing left for me to say
There's no more wicked games to play
It's time for me to walk away
I am alright

The music is making me grow
The only thing that keeps me awake is me knowing
There's no one here to break me or bring me down
And no one here to hurt me or fool around
I have no more time for you to hurt my feelings
Done enough to prove I'm all that I believe in
We are at the end, no more stupid lies
I'm better off without you here by my side

So now there is no longer you and I, you and I
You and I, you and I
You and I, you and I
You and I
There is no longer you and I, you and I
You and I, you and I
You and I, you and I
You and I
You might also like
Don't care what other people say
I know you fool around all day
No, it doesn't hurt me anyway
I am alright

The music is making me grow
The only thing that keeps me awake is me knowing
There's no one here to break me or bring me down
And no one here to hurt me or fool around
I have no more time for you to hurt my feelings
Done enough to prove I'm all that I believe in
We are at the end, no more stupid lies
I'm better off without you here by my side

So now there is no longer you and I, you and I
You and I, you and I
You and I, you and I
You and I
There is no longer you and I, you and I (You and I, ah)
You and I, you and I (I said, "You and I", oh)
You and I, you and I
You and I (You and I, oh)
There is no longer you and I, you and I (I said, "You and I")
You and I, you and I (Oh-oh, yeah)
You and I, you and I
You and I (You and I)Embed
