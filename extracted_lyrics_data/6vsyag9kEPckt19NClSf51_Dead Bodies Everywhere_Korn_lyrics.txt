27 ContributorsDead Bodies Everywhere Lyrics
Come on, step inside, and you will realize
Tell me what you need, tell me what to be
What's your vision you'll see?
What do you expect of me?
I can't live that lie

Hey, a sick mom with a fucked dad
Dealing with your life, dead bodies everywhere
You really want me to be a good son
Why you make me feel like no one?

Let me strip the plain, let me not give in
Free me of your lies, inside my heart dies
Your dreams never achieved
Don't lay that shit on me
Let me live my life

Hey, a sick mom with a fucked dad
Dealing with your life, dead bodies everywhere
You really want me to be a good son
Why you make me feel like no one?

You want me to be
Something I can never ever be
You want me to be
Something I can never ever be

A sick mom with a fucked dad
Dealing with your life, dead bodies everywhere
You really want me to be a good son
Why you make me feel like no one?

Dead bodies everywhere, dead bodies everywhere
Dead bodies everywhere, dead bodies everywhere
Dead bodies everywhere, dead bodies everywhere
Dead bodies everywhere, dead bodies everywhere2Embed
