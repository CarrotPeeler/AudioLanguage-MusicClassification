1 ContributorThe System LyricsThe television tells
How you must behave
This is the institution
Which really rules our state
We are living in a dictatorship
But none will believe
The people her are mute, and blind
The easiest way to go ahead
We can't resist the system
But we even can't accept
We object the government
And fight for our rights
We have to face our future
So try to make a chance
Or the world will collapse
And ruled by anarchy
CHORUS:
A very cruel sensation
On the first page in the news
The killer in the station
The system must abuseYou might also likeEmbed
