1 ContributorRemedy LyricsGet outta the streets, get outta your cage
Start thinkin' sharp you gotta get some rage
Set yourself free, set yourself free
Good rockin' music is all you need
It's gonna save your head, it's gonna save your soul
That good old fashioned, good time remedy they call rock'n'roll
Ain't no time for settlin' down
You got a whole lot of noise to make in this town
Rock'n'roll that's been goin' around
You gotta, pick it up and start layin' it down
It's gonna save your head, it's gonna save your soul
That good old fashioned, good time remedy they call rock'n'roll
Rock and roll!
Don't waste my time with fancy prancin'
Just rock and roll and get everybody dancin'
Take your worries and throw 'em away
They'll make you old, they're gonna make you gray
It's gonna save your head, it's gonna save your soul
That good old fashioned, good time remedy they call rock'n'roll
Good time rock'n'roll
Good time rock'n'roll
Ow! Good time rock'n'roll
Good time rock'n'roll
