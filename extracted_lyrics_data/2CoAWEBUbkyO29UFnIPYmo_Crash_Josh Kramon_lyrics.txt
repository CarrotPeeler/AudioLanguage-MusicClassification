3 ContributorsNight Kings Lyrics
Yeah
Yo Silas I see you, mh
Ah yes!
Ayy

Time to say 'Night-night" bitch, I'm that nigga
You ain't gotta like my shit (Hah!)
A clone couldn't duplicate a vibe like this
We timeless, you boys on some Fly-by-Night shit
I gotta make some money
Man, I wanna buy some nice shit (Hah!)
Don't get it twisted homie, you wrong if you ain't writing like this (What else?)
Son, I spit tsunamis
Banging like an Iron Mike hit
Don't got a pistol on me
Son, why you lyin' like this? (Why you lyin' bro? Sure)
It's CapCity, Rap city
Long as I got the streets with me
Quit askin' me, "Will you be safe?"
I'm coming back sweety
It's blasphemy, you cats really think you could rap with me (What?)
It's CapCity, Rap city
If you don't, then bring back
Who you sleepin' on? Voetsek tsoga
Who you speakin' on? Voetsek, thuuu
Chess moves, cash rules so voetsek move
You cats too rigid to make somethin' to step to
Respect rules a step one, loyalty step two (Ah yes!)

This is gangster rap
The streets sayin "Thanks for that"
Wait, where the gangsters at?
Ayy, where the gangsters at?
Party and bullshit, bo sweety pie came for that
Order what you want, lil' mama 'cause I'm payin' for that (That's right)
Cups in the air (Sure), let me tell you why we celebratin'
Pour it up, lift it up, the spirit gotta elevate (That's right)
Made it out the struggle so I welcome you to better days
'Cause being a real one is somethin' that will never age
Puffin' loud, playin' Snoop, singin' lodi dodi
With my nigga T, faded watchin' Chiefs Pirates derby
Next move, hang with some cuties in Khayalami
All I'm tryna do is make some money just to buy an army (What else?)
Ekse ngicel' i-fluit
Throw your middle fingers up
They used to never care, 'til we forced them to listen up
We started out small, now they gotta big us up
When it come to real energy nobody big as us

Man makes the money, money never makes the man

Man makes the money, money never makes the man

Outside of the evenin'
We the ones who do shit, have you not believin'
Dealers and thievin'
Hardest rap shit I do just to front, I'm boppin' and weavin'
I'm heavenly breathin'
Push me you'll be heavenly even
My enemy know that any me on any day is definitely a wild nigga movin'
Don't you hate all while you a student 
Ke mo Tau fologa Ramokgopa geo nyako mpona pila
O khwa Cap,O phela se pina
Right hand ke dealer
Left hand onale di stripe mfano tswile ledida
Ge oka lahla ba sailo theila ge fetsa bao tima
Ke mo Mphalane le Nicodima o sa mfa di ncondo
Tshwantse o kgono phela le batho, sa lebala hlompho!
Jos' kamoar' kous' yaka ya sgile,ne e nstamaisa skentshe
Baka fihla kao konopa bailo bethisa dance
I'm a king every night and I might go down with my throne
Barry White be light with the Barrytone
My corner is deep unlike any tone

We are the streets and the streets is us
We won't forget
We never forgot
We know who we are
We are Hip Hop! (Sure)
