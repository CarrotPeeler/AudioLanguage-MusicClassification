17 ContributorsStay Clean Lyrics
I can tell, seen before
Know the way, I know the law
I can't believe, can't obey
Can't agree with all the things
I hear you say

Oh no, ask me why
I can't go on with all the filthy white lies

Stay clean, stay clean
Stay clean, stay clean

Don't you know all the time
You got yours
And you know that I have mine?
Grab a hold, don't let go
Don't let them rob you
Of the only thing you know

Oh no, no-one else
Got the right to make you
Sorry for yourself
You might also like
Stay clean, stay clean
Stay clean, stay clean


So you see, the only proof
Of what you are, is in the way
You see the truth
Don't be scared, live to win
Although they're always gonna tell you it's a sin

In the end, you're on your own
And there is no-one
That can stop you being alone

Stay clean, stay clean
Stay clean, stay clean
It's your only hope
