1 ContributorLifeâ€™s a Bitch LyricsLifes a bitch i knew it the very second i was born
I reckon cause i was torn from the wombs warmth
By cold hands to a cold world a cold hospital full of
Cold girls dressed in all white i cried
Mom did too dad sighed
He always said it was relief i was alive
A zebra striped white lie the second in a series
The first a month before when he said he can't even hear me
But i had heard it loud and clearly
Terrified of fate that's why i'd arrived late eyes teary
In due course it would subside filled cheeks turned cheery
Moms teat was good eats and kept these feet turning
Burning rubber as soon as i could walk id be a runner
But couldn't fend for myself yet what a fucking bummer
I was stuck in a sorta ghetto suburb
Heard mother cussed out by father drunk some summers
Theyd pretend to be friends but always ended up butt hurt
Too young to understand why they fussed with eachother
A bad reaction all due to the way hed punk her
I had asthma attacks albuterol made the lungs work
Puff puff no pass me and my sisters set asunder
By the fact i refused to emulate a mother fucker
Built up hate would say it to his face when i could muster
For now laid in wait this my one and only blunder..
You might also likeShoved to the side each time a little number
Till i was craving chaos where there used to be discomfort
Video games until my thumbs hurt and moshing
Til the meaning of bleeding like a stuck pig was discovered
Shouldn't know what metastasized means
At the ripe young age of 16 i was a late bloomer
I lost my pops while goin through puberty
Left me broken resultin in too much tom foolery
What a tease life and death you two been cruel to me
Listening to his eulogies i cried only cause truthfully
They said that he was usually beautiful as is humanly
Possible for a dude to be all of this shit was new to me
Different from what i knew to be accustomed to his truancy
Verbal abuse fluenty spoken to us presumably
Cause he was treated brutally wish i could have related as a man
But alas was never granted that opportunity
He would probably agree he if he were still alive
With the threepenny orchestra circa 1925
Lifes a bitch and then you dieEmbed
