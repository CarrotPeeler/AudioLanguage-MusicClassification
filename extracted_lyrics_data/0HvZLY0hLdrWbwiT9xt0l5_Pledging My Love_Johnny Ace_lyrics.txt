Forever, my darling, our love will be true
Always and forever, I'll love just you
Just promise me, darling, your love in return
May this fire in my soul, dear, forever burn

My heart's at your command, dear
To keep, love, and to hold
Making you happy is my desire, dear
Keeping you is my goal

I'll forever love you
The rest of my days
I'll never part from you
And your loving ways


My heart's at your command, dear
To keep, love, and to hold
Making you happy is my desire, dear
Keeping you is my goal
You might also like
I'll forever love you
The rest of my days
I'll never part from you
And your loving waysEmbed
