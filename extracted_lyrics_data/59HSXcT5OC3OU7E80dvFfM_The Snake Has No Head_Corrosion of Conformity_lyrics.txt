1 ContributorThe Snake Has No Head LyricsInvalid at last
Smothers the working class
Nihilist to be
Turns the scrape into a gash
Walking tall and ignorant
This man is now a militant
Deceiving the prophet's confession
To release endless aggression
One is the soul
Amplified suicide
Keep the masses terrified
Nothing to kill
Nothing to kill
Nothing to kill
Nothing left unsaid
'Cause the snake has no head
But the body fills with greed
And we spill it when in need
And all the slaves are on probation
Growing fat in a comfortable nation
So the snake keeps on recruiting
We need one more royal shooting
Nothing left to lose
So we create another wound
You might also likeOne is the soul
Amplified suicide
Keep the masses terrified
Nothing to kill
Nothing to kill
Nothing to kill
Nothing left unsaid
'Cause the snake has no head
Fear of death is gain
Consuming the weak in shame
It's a power we can't see
But it leaves ourselves to blame
The shameless mourn another day
Slithering sins fade away
But the snake is just a pawn
And remains when we are gone...
One is the soul
Amplified suicide
Keep the masses terrified
Nothing to kill
Nothing to kill
Nothing to kill
Nothing left unsaid
'Cause the snake has no headEmbed
