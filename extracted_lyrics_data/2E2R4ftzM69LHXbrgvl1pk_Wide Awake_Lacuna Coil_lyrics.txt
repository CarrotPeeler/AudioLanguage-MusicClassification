3 ContributorsWide Awake Lyrics
(Yeah yeah, yeah yo-oh oh-oh)
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh oh-oh)
(Oh yeah yeah yeah)
(Oh oh-oh, oh-oh oh-oh)

The rebel inside
A mind of my own
I haven't felt right
Since the moment that I gave up
I challenge my limit
I'm feeling I'm becoming limitless
I take it all in and inhale

I'm wide awake
Open my eyes and the sky is so blue
All of a sudden
I know that I treasure my life
I find myself wide awake
Like you

The struggle within
Now I understand
Freedom begins
When you get out of the cage you built
It looks like I'm crazy but I'm not the only one
To believe in myself, believe in myself
I won't be coming undone

'Cause I feel like I'm wide awake
Open my eyes and the sky is so blue
All of a sudden
I know that I treasure my life
I find myself wide awake
Like you...
(Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh...)

I'm wide awake
Open my eyes and the sky's so blue
All of a sudden
I know that I treasure my life
All of a sudden
I know that I treasure my life
Like you
(Yeah... oh oh oh, oh-oh)
