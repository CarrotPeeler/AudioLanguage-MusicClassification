5 ContributorsYes I Do Lyrics
Cheap, trash
Long arms, funny legs, entertain
Provocatively, talkative, art school drop out
Designer clothes give me more, blue shirt, Gaultier
Fashion victim on the air, shaved off all my pubic hair
Deep down, they say I'm vermin
Got more faces than Cindy Sherman

Cash flow's gone low to the bank, get more dough
PC to Microsoft
Got my friend to buy me a loft
Oh, hell, it's shell
Sometimes they think I'm vermin
'Cause my parents, they're both German

Got a knee-length skirt with a rip up the side
A statement of style es tut mir leid
Wimps they come, wimps they go
We'll talk about you on our radio show

Deep down, they say I'm vermin
I've got more faces than Cindy Sherman
Sometimes they think I'm vermin
'Cause my parents, they are both German

Glow in the dark, disorderly behavior, neuro-transmitted trash
Reckless, flashback, comeback
Retro transgression, provocative
Vermin, consume, vermin, entertainment
Ruthless, refrain, glow in the dark1Embed
