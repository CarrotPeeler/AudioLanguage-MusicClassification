1 ContributorWelcome To Macabria LyricsThe thoughts, they slide hanging between the past, that has coiled my body with long heavy chains, and the future that doesn't belong to me and that sinks more and more into oblivion
Flashes of certainties rip from the sky of non-existence while tall flames burn down my sighs
I'm lost in the madness of this darkness... Of this perversion
A sharp dream that makes my soul bleed...You might also likeEmbed
