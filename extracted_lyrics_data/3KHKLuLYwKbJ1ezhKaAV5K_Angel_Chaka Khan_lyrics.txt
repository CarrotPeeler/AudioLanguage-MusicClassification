Troubled little angel
Inconsistent flying blind most of the time
Drama queen
Preening and untangling
Feathers in her wings
Captured by her dreams
Desperately, she sings

Needy little baby
Open up your heart
Don't you be afraid to feel
Needy little baby
Hiding deep inside
Don't you know your love can heal

Troubled little angel
Inconsistent flying blind most of the time
Don't know who to be, yeah
Always rearranging the
Wreckage of her life
Ever holding tight
To the hope that she'll be free
