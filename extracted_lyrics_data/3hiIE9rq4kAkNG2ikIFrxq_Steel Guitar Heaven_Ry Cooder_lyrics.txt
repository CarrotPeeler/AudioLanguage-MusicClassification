1 ContributorSteel Guitar Heaven Lyrics
Oh well, I want to go to steel guitar heaven
That's the only resting place for me
I want to go to steel guitar heaven
There's a lot of swinging cats I been wanting to see
Like Joaquin Murphy and Jimmy Day
I'll shake hands with Speedy and shout hooray
That's steel guitar heaven to me

I heard about steel guitar heaven
I'm going when I die
I heard Paul Bixby's been waiting
He's got something new that he wants me to try
Turns itself on, tells you a joke
It lights you a drink and pours you a smoke
Paul, I don't think it's ready!
That's steel guitar heaven to me

Well, folks, I think the good Lord must love steel players. You know, He's made so many of 'em. And matter of fact, He's still trying
But the good Lord knows that the steel player's life on Earth isn't often easy. So He's set aside a little corner of Heaven, custom made, just for you
First thing you'll notice, there's always plenty of courteous free parking. And don't it just seem like that old triple-neck ain't near as heavy as it used to be?
You might also likeStep inside, and you'll find that the walls are covered in real knotty pine. And just take a gander at all that luxurious hi-lo shag, continuous filament nylon-pile, wall-to-wall carpeting. Our Lord chose green-and-gold, my personal favorite
The tables and chairs are upholstered in genuine Naugahyde, and here our Lord chose red, I think it's appropriate
There's always a lot of cowboy carrying on up on the bandstand, and you're bound to hear some old familiar voices calling, "Man, look who's here, come on up and sit on in - it's C6-A again."

Well, you can't get fired up in Heaven
Your union card's all paid
There ain't no bosses up in Heaven
I heard Spade Cooley didn't make the grade
Everybody's got a story up in Heaven
Some we all know well
All steel players go to Heaven
Some just go through Hell
But the Good Lord loves each and every one
When your ragtime cowboy days are done
Come up to steel guitar Heaven with me
That's steel guitar Heaven to meEmbed
