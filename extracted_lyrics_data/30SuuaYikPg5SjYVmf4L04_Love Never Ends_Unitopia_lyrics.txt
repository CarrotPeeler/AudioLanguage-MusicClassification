1 ContributorLove Never Ends LyricsShe lifts me up and takes me somewhere I've never been.
She reaches out and touches me, like no other.
This feeling never ends
This feeling never ends (feeling it in my heart)
Our love takes me to a higher place
My love, your love...
Eyes shining like the sunlight with that smile she sends to me
She is my future, and my friend, we are ever meant to be
Love never ends
Love never endsEmbed
