10 ContributorsTexas Blood Money Lyrics
One, two, three, four
The stars at night are big and bright
Deep in the heart of Texas
Hell yeah!

If you can't tell by the way I talk
Then you sure as hell better check the way I walk
A million miles tall and wide
Is just beginning to scratch the surface of our pride

Standing tall through it all
The lone star shines and flies alone
The only place that we call home

Everything is bigger in Texas
Loaded double barrel, blow you to pieces
Everything is bigger in Texas
Loaded double barrel, blow you to pieces (Oh!)

Let's do a toast for our lone star state (Put 'em up)
Shotgun heavy, drinking booze all day
See Upon a Burning Body LiveGet tickets as low as $41You might also like
I'm back motherfuckers, this round too
Pour me a fucking JÃ¤gerbomb
Fuck that, I got whiskey, let's mix this shit
From the east to the south

Now my friends lay me down to sleep
A fifth of whiskey down by my feet
If I should die before I wake
Tell everyone that I drank it straight

Just another night in the lone star state
Next round's on me (Chug-chug)
All the cowboys from hell
Drink for free

Respect the land that we come from (Respect, walk)
Respect the ground that we walk on (Respect, walk)
It's the place we call home
So walk on home boy

Everything is bigger in Texas
Loaded double barrel, blow you to pieces
Everything is bigger in Texas
Loaded double barrel, blow you to pieces
Ten steps closer to hell we stand
This is our god-given promised land

The stars at night are big and bright
Deep in the heart of Texas
The stars at night are big and bright
Deep in the heart of Texas

We respect the land that we come from
It's the place we call home
We respect the ground that we walk on
It's the place we call home
Don't fuck with Texas1Embed
