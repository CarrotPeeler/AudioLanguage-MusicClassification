24 ContributorsPantyhose Lyrics
Boys marching to war
To certain defeat
They were younger than me
Guns poke through the trees
Death on a whim
They were aiming at him

And when the bullets came he didn't duck
He wrapped her pantyhose around his neck
And he could feel their magic working
Keeping him from harm
Away to some place mystical and warm
His lucky charm

He got caught
No cover at all
He'd breathe in her scent
Not even a scratch
He didn't die
When he stepped on a mine
They were violet and soft
It didn't go off
You might also like
And when her letter came
He didn't cry
He wrapped her pantyhose around his eyes
And he could feel their magic working
Keeping him from harm
Even though she didn't love him anymore
You can't kill a lucky charm1Embed
