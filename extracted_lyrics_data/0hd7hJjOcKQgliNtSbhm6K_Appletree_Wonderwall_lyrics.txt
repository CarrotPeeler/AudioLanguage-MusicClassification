I'm sittin' on my window sill and looking
Through the pain you broke my heart
Oh mamma no you cannot teach me a different soul
I won't believe in your God of course I see this clouds
Above but that's not God, that's not the Lord
And the smoke of my cigarette got into my eyes and now
I'm feel like I'm gonna cry
And all you guys laugh at me but I don't feel like
I am just a child, just a child
And I don't give a damm
Yes I don't give a damm
I don't give a damm
And break my apple in two pieces or three
Imagine the world is just an apple tree and live your life
And be careful 'cause harvest time is your death don't fall
And I don't give a damm
Yes I don't give a damm
I don't give a damm
You're laughin' but you wanna cry your coolness hey
Is just a lie you're venerable too it's the price you
Have to pay look in the mirror before you try to fly you have
No wings come on be reasonable guy don't try
And I don't give a damm
Yes I don't give a damm
I don't give a damm
Break my apple in two pieces or three
Imagine the world is just an apple tree and live your life
And be careful 'cause harvest time is your death don't fall
And I don't give a damm
Yes I don't give a damm
I don't give a damm
Your blood is runnin' through my head then my temples then my
Bed drowsy eyes and big composure your cut throat spits a
Clear red tincture full of love and full of greed I cannot
Sleep I cannot sleep
And I don't give a damm
Yes I don't give a damm
I don't give a damm
Break my apple in two pieces or three
Imagine the world is just an apple tree and live your life
And be careful 'cause harvest time is your death don't fall
And I fall
I fall
I fallYou might also likeEmbed
