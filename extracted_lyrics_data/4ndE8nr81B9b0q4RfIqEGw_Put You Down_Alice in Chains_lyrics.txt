18 ContributorsPut You Down Lyrics
Heartbreaker, feelin' all right
Body over, mind, it's slower
Reduction is addictive, too
Personality overview
I can see what the cost will be
You know, I don't need you
I just can't put you down
I can see what it all means to me
Honey, I don't need you
I just can't put you down
Can't put you down

Hard drinker, feelin' all tight
Your maker, mine, it's slower
Reduction is addictive, too
Personality overview

I can see what the cost will be
You know, I don't need you
I just can't put you down
I can see what it all means to me
Honey, I don't need you
I just can't put you down

Put you down, down, down
Gonna put you down, down
Put you down, down, down
Gonna put you down, down
Put you down, down, down
Gonna put you down, down
Put you down, down, down
Gonna put you down, down

Everything you buy is for the jingle
Every time you lie, it's all the same
Ooh, and if you need a rhyme to kill the singer
Shoot me dead before I may be through1Embed
