4 ContributorsFainted Blue Ornaments LyricsThe acid reflux in my throat hasn't appeased my taste for bitter blondes
I've twisted so many necks and now their souls daily blind my mind
Your presence, I took for granted
I deceived your confidence
I'll never achieve emotional numbness
Nor will I enjoy a single peaceful rest
Your presence, I took for granted
I deceived your confidence
Your angelic hand touches
My venomous spine
Through overwhelming nightmares
I now stand under
This Damocles dagger
I'll kill again to lighten apathy towards me
The amazing brightness that makes you so precious
And exceptional tears me apart
I need your presence but my shadow is tarnishing your radiance
I need your presence but my shadow is tarnishing your radiance
I need your presence but my shadow is tarnishing your radiance
I need your presence but my shadow is tarnishing your radiance
I need your presence but my shadow is tarnishing your radiance

Make my world uglier this morning
Repentance hurts but not enough
Let's start again tonight
