1 ContributorThe Key LyricsThey say if you can find the end of it
There's a gold key
Leading you up through the shadowlands â€“ like a memory
Oh the way, the way oh the way of it
Is a mystery
Oh the way, the way oh the way of it
So dear to me
They say in the arms of the shadowlands
'Neath the gathering dark
Creatures both lovely and frightening are
Shown to be what they really are
Oh the way, the way oh the way of it
Is a mystery
The shimmering, shattering light of it
So dear to meYou might also likeEmbed
