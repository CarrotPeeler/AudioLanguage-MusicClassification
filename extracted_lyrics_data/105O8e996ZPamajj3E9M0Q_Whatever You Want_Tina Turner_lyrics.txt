7 ContributorsWhatever You Want Lyrics
Whatever you want me to do
I will do it for you
Whatever you want me to be
I will be what you need

Because it's love that I feel
Whenever you're really near
I'm feeling sensual
I can't rely on myself
I'm wanting you and no one else
You've got me wrapped up

'Cause time takes what love heals
Wherever you are, I know it's for real

Whatever you want me to do
I will do it for you
Whatever you want me to be
I will be what you need
Because it's love that I feel
Whenever you're really near
I'm feeling sensual
And I, I know that it's real
You might also like
I know you've had pains in your heart
That have torn you apart
I know you've been safe on your own
But together we're strong
Because it's love that I feel
Whenever you're holding me
I'm feeling passionate
And I can't deny it in myself
I'm wanting you and no one else
You've got the power

'Cause love takes what time steals
And deep in my heart
I know that it's real

Whatever you want me to do
I will do it for you
Whatever you want me to be
I will be what you need
Because it's love that I feel
Whenever you're next to me
I'm feeling sensual
I know (I know), I know (I know), that it's real
Whatever you want me to do, do
Whatever you want me to do

'Cause time takes and love heals
Wherever you are
I know it's for real
I know, I know that it's real

Whatever you want me to do baby, baby, baby
I will do, darling, do it for you
Whatever you want me to be, yeah
I will be everything
Because it's love that I feel
Whenever you're really near
I'm feeling sexual
It's time that I breathe
For the love that pleases me
Too easily, easily, babyEmbed
