Awkward, babe (Awkward)
Awkward, darling (Awkward)
Awkward, babe (Awkward)
Awkward, sugar (Awkward)
Awkward (Awkward)
Awkward, honey (Awkward)
Awkward (Awkward)
Awkward, yeah (Awkward)

Awkward you, awkward me
Awkward after all this time
A chance to meet on the street
So crowded with hustla's and dreams
And it's even more awkward seeing you wearing that ring
And I, can't say what happened, can't say when
I never thought that I'd get to see you again
I got plenty more *** for the **** I been through
And I really can't believe it, is that really you?

And it's killing me to see you again
And not can't help but wonder
If you'll really be with him for the long run
What have I done? Ha

Must have been outta my mind when I let you go
Think about you all of the time, gotta let you know (Hmm)
Must have been outta my mind when I let you go
(Aw, baby)
Think about you all of the time, gotta let you know
You know

Awkward, baby (Awkward)
Awkward, darling (Awkward)
Awkward (Awkward)
Awkward (Awkward)

Awkward and I, seem to feel like it's all a
Case of deja-vu, but I prefer to call it karma
'Cause usually I'm the one that's breaking the heart
And after so much drama now it's me that's falling apart

And, girl, it's killing me, find it so hard to breathe
Thought the grass was greener
But now I'd give anything to have you alone now
Just tell me how
Must have been outta my mind when I let you go
(Oh yeah)
Think about you all of the time, gotta let you know (Hmm)
Must have been outta my mind when I let you go
Think about you all of the time
(Baby, think about you all of the time)
Gotta let you know
(Oh, gotta let you go, baby)
You know

I was waiting for your love, you can only wait so long
I was hoping and praying you would see what was going on
Now we're standing here with open hearts
And I'm chained inside my world
No, you lost me, boy, and you can't change that
It's obviously clear

You must have been outta your mind when you let me go (Mmm)
I think about you all of the time, gotta let you know
I must have been outta my mind (You must have been outta your mind)
When I let you go (When you let me go)
I think about you all of the time
Gotta let you know (Gotta let me know)
Oh, I must have been outta your mind (Outta your mind)
When I let you go
I think about you all of the time
Gotta let you know (Gotta let me know)Embed
