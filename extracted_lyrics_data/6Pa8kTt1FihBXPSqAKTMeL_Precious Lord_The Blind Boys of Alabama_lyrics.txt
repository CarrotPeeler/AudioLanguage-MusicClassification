I am tired, I am weak and, and I am worn
The storm, through the night, lead me on to the night
Precious Lord take my hand, lead me home
When the night grows so dreary, precious Lord draw, draw me nearer
I am tired, I am weak and I am so worn
At the river, ooh, Lord I stand, guide my feet and hold my hand
Precious Lord take my hand and lead, lead me home
Lead me home, lead me homeYou might also likeEmbed
