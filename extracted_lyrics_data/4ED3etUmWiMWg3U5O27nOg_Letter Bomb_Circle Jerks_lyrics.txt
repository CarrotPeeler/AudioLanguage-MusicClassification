3 ContributorsLetter Bomb LyricsTired of being bossed around
Getting the runaround
Sweep your floors, empty your trash
You're the one that makes the cash
Tired of being a pissant 9 to 5
Open my letter, you won't be alive
Here's a present just for you
When you open it, you'll be through
Sit behind your desk, act like a king
Treat me like a human being
Give me the worst jobs, I'm getting mad
When you're dead, I'll be glad
Here's a present just for you
When you'll open it, you'll be through
Plastic explosive on your letter
You'd be better off dead
Hope the building crumbles
On your head
Die, die!See Circle Jerks LiveGet tickets as low as $70You might also likeEmbed
