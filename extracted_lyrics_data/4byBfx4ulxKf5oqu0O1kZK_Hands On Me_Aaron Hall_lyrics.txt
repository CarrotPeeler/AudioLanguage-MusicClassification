(verse1-Kane)
What you gonna do?
Its on you, I ain't gon' sweat, you beef you
I wanna come get you
What you mean your man won't let you?
I knew about him when I first met you
It ain't stop nuthin, at the Mariott fuckin'
A week lata blow me up while he blowin up your paga
Messed up I ain't no hata
Its all about the game, its all about the playa
You should've never ate her. You knew what you had
You can't change her
Why you mad 'cause I banged her?
Ain't got time for the conversation, don't keep me waitin
I'm so impatient, my time is money
When the clock keeps tickin' its wastin'
My voice got your heart racin
You know you wanted me but you settled for him
I look betta than him, dress betta than him
Make you laugh, make more chedda' than him
My tux get you more wetta' than him
Lets be friends. Bring cheese,bring the juice and gin
I'll pick you up at a quarter till 10
Then....jump in my ride let's keep it on the DL
True playaz like me neva hit and tell
If you can keep a secret I can keep a secret so well

I know you got a man
But I don't care
He don't please you, like I would do my baby
Yeah Yeah
(Verse 2-Abel)
Only got a little bit of time on my hands
Just enough to be a ladie's man
Got a little black book with alot of phone numbers I call when I can
That's the way it was, but now somehow them tables done got switched
Got me dialin yo number in the middle of the night
Like I'm sick and I need a fix
My boys tellin me I'm whipped
But I'm tellin you I know you hooked
I could never be scared and I don't care
If your man give me them dirty looks
He should, but that's cool
I can deal with him, I'd rather be dealin with you
We can do some things we ain't suppose to do
Maybe do somethings you might've hoped to do
So if it's cool, maybe you could come through
And we could get it togetha
But you sayin' you can't because of your man?
Alright, whateva
So jump in my ride
Let's keep it on the DL
True playaz neva hit and tell
If you can keep a secret, I can keep a secret so well

See you at the park
See you at the mall
See you at the club
I see you with him always
I don't care
See you at the club
See you at the mall
See you at the park
I see you with him always
(Why you still lookin, why you still lookin?)
I don't care
Why you still lookin at me?
