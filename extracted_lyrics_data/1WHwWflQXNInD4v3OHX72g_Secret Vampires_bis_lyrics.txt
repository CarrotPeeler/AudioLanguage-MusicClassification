1 ContributorSecret Vampires LyricsWe've got a secret society
You all recognise the members
Cause we act normally
But when it gets after midnight
The kids all go out
And we become secret vampires
There's a disco in town
You've never met us
You won't forget us
Got blood desire?
Secret vampires!
The cool kids are dancing
And we sit round the side
It's these marks on our necks
That we are trying to hide
But with our pale expressions
It not hard to see that we are
Secret vampires and we're getting thirsty
You've never met us
You won't forget us
Got blood desire?
Secret vampires! ...You might also likeEmbed
