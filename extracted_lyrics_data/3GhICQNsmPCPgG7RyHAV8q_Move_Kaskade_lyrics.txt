1 ContributorMove LyricsTrust me, really believe
That I can care for all your needs
Close your eyes, you will see
It's all about you and me
Let's do it
It's all right
The feeling is everything
It's precious
So delicate
Move your thing
I just want to see you dance and touch your body
It's interesting how you make it come alive
When you be doing it
Have you ever found free
And was it everything you dreamed
Let me tell you all that I have seen
And show you all the lovely thingsSee Kaskade LiveGet tickets as low as $113You might also likeEmbed
