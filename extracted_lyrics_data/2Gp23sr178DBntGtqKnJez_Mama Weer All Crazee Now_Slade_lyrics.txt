7 ContributorsMama Weer All Crazee Now Lyrics
Oww!

I don't want to drink my whisky like you do
I don't need to spend my money but still do

A-don't stop now, a c'mon
Another drop now, a c'mon
I wanna lot now, so c'mon
That's why, that's why

I said Mama, but we're all crazy now
I said Mama, but we're all crazy now
I said Mama, but we're all crazy now
Woo!
Yeah!

And you told me a fool fire water won't hurt me
And you tease me, and all my ladies desert me

A-don't stop now, a c'mon
Another drop now, a c'mon
I wanna lot now, so c'mon
That's why, that's why

I said Mama, but we're all crazy now
I said Mama, but we're all crazy now
Ow
Stop it!

I don't want to a-drink my whisky but still do
I had enough to a-fill the patios glass shoe

A-don't stop now, a c'mon
Another drop now, a c'mon
I wanna lot now, so c'mon
That's why, that's why

I said mama, but we're all crazy now
I said mama, but we're all crazy now
I said mama, but we're all crazy now

I said mama, but we're all crazy now
I said mama, but we're all crazy now
I said mama, but we're all crazy now
I said mama, but we're all crazy now
I said mama, but we're all crazy now, yeah
I said mama, but we're all crazy now

Come on, come on
I said mama, but we're all crazy now
Come on, come on, come on
I said mama, but we're all crazy nowEmbed
