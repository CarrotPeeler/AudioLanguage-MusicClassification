21 ContributorsYours Is No Disgrace Lyrics

Yesterday a morning came, a smile upon your face
Caesar's palace, morning glory, silly human race
On the sailing ship to nowhere, leaving any place
If the summer changed to winter, yours is no disgrace

Battleships confide in me and tell me where you are
Shining, flying, purple wolfhound, show me where you are
Lost in summer, morning, winter, travel very far
Lost in losing circumstances, that's just where you are


Yesterday a morning came, a smile upon your face
Caesar's palace, morning glory, silly human, silly human race
On a sailing ship to nowhere, leaving any place
If the summer changed to winter, yours is no, yours is no disgrace
Yours is no disgrace
Yours is no disgrace

You might also like
Death defying, mutilated armies gather near
Crawling out of dirty holes, their morals
Their morals disappear

Yesterday a morning came, a smile upon your face
Caesar's palace, morning glory, silly human, silly human, silly human race
On a sailing ship to nowhere, leaving any place
If the summer changed to winter, yours is no, yours is no disgrace
Yours is no disgrace
Yours is no disgrace

Battleships confide in me and tell me where you are
Shining, flying, purple wolfhound, show me where you are
Lost in summer, morning, winter, travel very far
Lost in losing circumstances, that's just where you are2Embed
