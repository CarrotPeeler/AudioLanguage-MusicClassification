With trying to feel
Nothing is over
Nothing is real
While searching for ways
Out of the deep
How this world can be a place to breath again
And I begin to wonder
How life could get away from me
With all I couldn't save
Silence the only way
Since you've been gone
I try to arrange
With nothing but fear
I don't want the change
Emptiness haunts
At day and by night
And how on earth will I be able to
Feel again?
And when I am gone
You'll have nothing to fear
Just silence that knows
That I will not be here
I'll leave you in hope
To remember the days
We walked through the light
Until we had to part ways...You might also likeEmbed
