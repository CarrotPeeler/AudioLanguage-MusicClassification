2 ContributorsShow & Prove Lyrics
Baby, I got some things I wanna show you
And baby, I got some places we could go to
No more playing around, let's take it old school
'Cause I'll be your man, you'll be my girl
Together, we can face the world

'Cause anybody could tell you that you're beautiful (that you're beautiful)
Anybody can tell you what they gon' do for you
And buy fancy things, and all that it brings
He might promise you a ring
But at the end he won't do a thing, he won't do a thing

He won't show it (like I will, like I will)
He won't prove it (like I will, like I will)
He won't show it (like I will, like I will)
He won't prove it (like I will, like I will)
He won't show it (like I will, like I will)
He won't prove it (like I will, like I will)
He won't show it (like I will, like I will)
He won't prove it (like I will, like I will)

Girl, other guys would just waste your time
And to find somebody better than me is gonna take a lifetime
And girl, let's get one thing understood
When I do what I do when I do what I do
I do it too good, I do it too good
You might also like
'Cause anybody could tell you that you're beautiful (that you're beautiful)
Anybody can tell you what they gon' do for you
And buy fancy things, and all that it brings
He might promise you a ring
But at the end he won't do a thing, he won't do a thing

He won't show it (like I will, like I will)
He won't prove it (like I will, like I will)
He won't show it (like I will, like I will)
He won't prove it (like I will, like I will)
He won't show it (like I will, like I will)
He won't prove it (like I will, like I will)
He won't show it (like I will, like I will)
He won't prove it (like I will, like I will)

No, no, no, no, no
No, no, he can't show it
He can't prove it, no

He won't show it (like I will, like I will)
He won't prove it (like I will, like I will)
He won't show it (like I will, like I will)
He won't prove it (like I will, like I will)
He won't show it (like I will, like I will)
He won't prove it (like I will, like I will)
He won't show it (like I will, like I will)
He won't prove it (like I will, like I will)
He won't show it (like I will, like I will)
He won't prove it (like I will, like I will)
He won't show it (like I will, like I will)
He won't prove it (like I will, like I will)
He won't show it (like I will, like I will)
He won't prove it (like I will, like I will)
He won't show it (like I will, like I will)
He won't prove it (like I will, like I will)Embed
