4 ContributorsDo You Wanna Die Without a Scar Lyrics
It's the angst of things to come
You're immaculate and young
You wash your hands in innocence
And keep it to the bitter end

But under your skin you're dying in sin

Do you wanna die without a scar
With untainted memoirs
Do you wanna die without a scar
The blandest au revoir

Good and evil equals par
Every pleasure leaves a scar
Every fire leaves a bulb
Every touch can leave a mark



And the hours turn to days
Time is spinning in delays
Do you wanna die without a scar
You might also like
No heart - No pain
No scars - No shame
No love - No fear
The end is near



Do you wanna die without a scar
The blandest au revoirEmbed
