3 ContributorsThe Puppeteer LyricsA puppet
Hears from the stage
The audience's applause
For the puppeteers displays
But the marionette, believes it's for she
I'll perform by myself she thought
And petulantly cut her strings
I am the one who picked you up
From your cold wooden sleep
My nasty hand who brought you life
Graceful
When you thought that you could dance alone
You turned and savaged me
Without my hand you fall back down
Puppet fall back down
It's painful
To drop so low
When not so long before
She thought she'd stole the show
Now she lies in wait
Ready to reach
And haul herself back up
On the cocks of other puppeteers
I am the one who picked you up
From your cold wooden sleep
My nasty hand who brought you life
Graceful
When you thought that you could dance alone
Turned and savaged me
Without my hand you fall back down
Puppet fall back down
Puppet fall back down
Puppet fall back down
Puppet fall back down
Puppet fall back downYou might also likeEmbed
