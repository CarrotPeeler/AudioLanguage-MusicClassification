Yeah, NAX
Mkinajisi mziki tunabadili msingi

Nikiwa kwa womb nilikuwa na-contemplate verse
Sikuget immuned coz I've been sick since birth
First rhymes niliandika na amniotic fluid
Intuned- so jua the sun is insync with the stars
Kwa mic there's no love, bado na-duck  arrow za Cupid
We ni snail Mcee endelea kuslug tuneza ku-assault na chumvi
He was just a toad akachukua leap of faith saa hii ana-give it his all akiwinda
Ati NAX hakuna ma-GOAT, walidhani tuko so remote
Sahii tunawa-mute wakiskika
Bars zinaenda overboard- nawapa  hooks lines and sinkers
Hii ni ya crooks, swines and thinkers
Na wale wanapenda books, rhymes and reefer
Just for the few minds
Juu Akili nyingi huondoa maarifa
Mkinajisi mziki tunabadili msingi
So i took time kuandika, TRA!You might also likeEmbed
