2 ContributorsFar Gone Now LyricsDon't go looking for him lady
Don't go lookinng for him now
He'll be sailing 'cross the ocean
By the time you turn around
All he carries is his pride
He has nothing to his name
What he's leaving you behind
Is the burdon ofthe blame
Don't go looking for him lady
He's far gone now
Don't go looking for him lady
Don't go looking for him now
He's somewhere across the border
In some lonely, little town
A tatoo on his arm
Is all that will remain
Of a lady with no heart
Playing stupid little games
Don't go looking for him lady
He's far gone now
And now you're gazing at the moon
Humming melancholic lines
Burning candles in your room
As if to see the light
You might also likeDon't go looking for him lady
Don't go looking for him now
He'll be over the horizon
By the time you come around
You can stare out at the sky
Building castles in the air
He won't be coming back this time
There'll be no answer to your prayers
Don't go looking for him lady
He's far gone now
And now you're gazing at the moon
Humming melancholic lines
Burning candles in your room
As if to see the light
Don't go looking for him lady
Don't go looking for him now
There's no need to be sorry for yourself
It don't matter anyhow
Don't go looking for him lady
He's far gone now
Don't go looking for him kady
He's far gone nowEmbed
