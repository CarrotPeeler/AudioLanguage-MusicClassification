(SRT shit nigga, we been getting racks)
Sometimes gotta do it all by myself
Can't depend on nobody else
I be deep down in my thoughts, thinking 'bout how people would've felt
Who gon give a fuck how I felt
What you go through, nobody can help
Want it done, nigga do it yourself
Can't forget that I'm MHG Dell
So I roll up some za for my health
Fuck it, I'm playing cards I was dealt
I don't want noone hittin' my cell
All rats must die, hope they go to hell
How you think I feel, bro don't got bail
Fuck all the fame, I just want the wealth

Talkin' my shit, that's regular Dell shit
Big EBK, anybody get dealt with
Anything in this 40 way, getting melted
Shit'll leave you on the floor, dead and helpless
I don't wanna talk, it's not beneficial
Niggas be fake, fully artificial
You can't talk on my name, because I'm offical
How you talkin' on gang, nigga who is you
Niggas be hating, they don't even know us
They prolly mad 'cause they bitch tryna blow us
Can't wait 'til the day that they can go and show up
Why the fuck would I bluff, I don't play no poker
Quickdraw gang, if he  then it's over
Only time I feel good, when drank in my soda
Whole gang on court, watch 'em take over
Say he fuckin' with me, I know he ain't sober
Gang

Sometimes gotta do it all by myself
Can't depend on nobody else
I be deep down in my thoughts, thinking 'bout how people would've felt
Who gon give a fuck how I felt
What you go through, nobody can help
Want it done, nigga do it yourself
Can't forget that I'm MHG Dell
So I roll up some za for my health
Fuck it, I'm playing cards I was dealt
I don't want noone hittin' my cell
All rats must die, hope they go to hell
How you think I feel, bro don't got bail
Fuck all the fame, I just want the wealthEmbed
