28 ContributorsFeels Blind Lyrics
All the doves that fly past my eyes
Have a stickiness to their wings
In the doorway of my demise, I stand
Encased in the whisper you taught me

How does it feel? It feels blind
How does it feel? Well, it feels fuckin' blind
What have you taught me? Nothing
Look at what you have taught me, your world has taught me nothing

If you were blind and there was no braille
There are no boundaries on what I can feel
If you could see, but were taught
What you saw wasn't fucking real, yeah

How does it feel? It feels blind
How does it feel? Well, it feels fucking blind
What have you taught me? Nothing
Look at what you have taught me, your world has taught me nothing

You might also like
I'm the woman I was taught to always be, hungry
Yeah, women are well acquainted with thirst
Hell, I could eat just about anything
We might even eat your hate up like love

I eat your hate like love, I eat your hate like love
I eat your hate like love, I eat your hate like love
I eat your hate like love, I eat your hate like love
I'd eat your fucking hate up like love

How does it feel? It feels blind
How does it feel? Well, it feels fucking blind
What have you taught me? Nothing
Look at what you have taught me, your world has taught me nothing
