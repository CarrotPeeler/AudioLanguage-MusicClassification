1 ContributorBeggin Back Lyrics
Oh my baby, take me back
Why, why, Lord, take me back
Listen here, mama, I'll be good
Make your fire and cut your wood
When I had you, you wouldn't do
I got another and I don't want you

 old joker, every time it gets cold, you commence to beggin' me to take you back
You know I don't care anything for you
Why do you worry me so?
You treats me like... that you were fixin' to leave me now
Baby, I wants to tell you, you ain't been actin' right for the last 30 days
Now, and when I come home after noon, my meals are not ready, and you know I'm a man who can't stand such as that
I want to eat whеn eating time comes, and su— sugar, now listеn here
You sure is worryin' my mind
I want you to stop that, before you gon— you gonna find everything outdoors

Every evening, half past eight
I'll play around the rich man gate
Working and studying, thinking out the plan
How to get that biscuit out that rich man's hand
Rich man hand, rich man hand
How to get that biscuit out the rich man's hand

What is it, woman? Tell me what in the world the matter with you?
You is actin' awful funny, gal, you actin' plumb naughty
Now listen, I'm gon' tell you one thing, I ain't gon' tell you no more
You gotta use , baby, from the way you've been actin' the last Thursday
Now, if you don't, tonight when you come home you'll find a moon wagon at your gate, and your clothes at the front gate, and a man sittin' up there, Lord, he's gon' quit
And honey, that's all

You didn't thank me 
I ain't gonna beg you to take me back
I went walkin' down the line
To see will this woman change her mind
She turned 'round two or three times
Take you back in the wintertimeEmbed
