12 ContributorsSynthetic World Lyrics
Hey you, I'm up from the Bayou
Where wildlife runs free
You could say that I'm country
But let me tell you what I see
Your world is plastic
Can see through to the other side
Your cities are made of wood
Antiques are what you've got inside
Houses are paper
But folks don't hear a word you say
Friendship's like acid
It burns as it slides away

So you see, my patience is growin' thin
With this synthetic world we're livin' in

The word "imitation" lives across the nation
What's real has become a freak
Someone's tryin' to make me weak
Strange initials to keep me blind
Psychedelic music to blow my mind
You might also like
So you see, my patience is growin' thin
With this synthetic world we're livin' in

Spray to clear the air, air to clear the spray
Makin' people die every day
And now I find I'm out of place
If I only have one face
All my friends have more than two
No longer must you be you
They found out how to transplant
"Maybe" has replaced "can"

So, you see, my patience is growin' thin
With this synthetic world we're livin' in, hmm

Nee na na nee na na
Nee na nee na nee na na nee na na na
Na na na na na na na nee na
Nee na na na na
Na na na na na na nee na na nee na na
Na na na na nee na na na na nee na nee na na naEmbed
