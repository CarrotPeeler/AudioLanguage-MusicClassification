7 ContributorsUninvited Guest Lyrics
I am walking the streets, I am wandering aimlessly
I can see that it's all for sale and it saddens me
All alone and it looks like everyone else is busy
All avoiding eye contact with me

I could be well-dressed, even on the money I have left
I could buy another day of nothing
Even in my best, I'm an uninvited guest
Waste another day on nothing
I could get out of my head, even on the money I have left
I could buy another day of nothing
Even in my best, I'm an uninvited guest
Lost another day of nothing

I've been walking the streets, it's another purposeless day
I am far from the reasons it took to pass this way
I am haunted by thoughts, I am daunted by things to do and people to see
Catch my eye, passerby, before I pass through

I could be well-dressed, even on the money I have left
I could buy another day of nothing
Even in my best, I'm an uninvited guest
Waste another day on nothing
I could get out of my head, even on the money I have left
I could buy another day of nothing
I could never quite forget, I'm an uninvited guest
You might also like
I keep wandering aimlessly until that flickering moment of intensity
A familiar stranger will recognise me
Will glance my way, see something in me
I keep wandering aimlessly until that flickering moment of intensity
A familiar stranger will recognise me
Will glance my way, see something in me
I keep on wandering aimlessly until that flickering moment of intensity
A familiar stranger will recognise me, will see something in me
Well, to see something, here in the world, time maybe curved by a word

I could be well-dressed, even on the money I have left
I could buy another day of nothing
Even in my best, I'm an uninvited guest
Waste another day on nothing
I could get out of my head, even on the money I have left
I could buy another day of nothing
Even in my best, I'm an uninvited guest
Lost another day of nothing

Not sure how I'm gonna survive survival
Don't know if this is living a life worthwhile
Not sure if I have even arrived on arrival, I'm tired
Not sure if I'm ready to laugh or to cryEmbed
