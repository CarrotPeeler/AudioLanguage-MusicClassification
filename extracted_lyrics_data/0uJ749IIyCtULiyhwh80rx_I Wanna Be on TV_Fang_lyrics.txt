Wanna be a pretty boy
Wanna go on Solid Gold
Wanna date a millionaire
Wanna make people stare

I wanna be on TV
Want people to know me
I wanna be on TV

Studio 54
Gonna be on the floor
Wanna make people dance
Gonna take off my pants

I wanna be on TV
Want people to know me
I wanna be on TV

Wanna make the scene
Gonna get some free cocaine
Gonna wear my Calvin Klein's
Emmy awards will be all mine

I wanna be on TV
Want people to know me
I wanna be on TVEmbed
