2 ContributorsHad To Go LyricsOh there was silence thinly veiled as peace
Then oh the lightning struck and it started a fire
Oh we lost all patience, things they keep on turning
When you take the bark all off the tree and it's standing stark
Lately I'm feeling so alone
I have packed up my bags and I've left my home
And now everything's changed and I'm feeling alone
I got no one to blame 'cause I had to go
And it started raining and there was a flood
The water kept on rising higher, we had to get above
I come to you open, organs on my sleeve
Won't you help me now? Help me find peace
Lately I'm feeling so alone
I have packed up my bags and I've left my home
Now everything's changed and I'm feeling alone
I got no one to blame 'cause I had to goYou might also likeEmbed
