Yeah, 1-2, 1-2
Uh, Ugly Heroes
Yeah, I always knew I had it in me
Did you? Yeah

My team been through it
We proved them all wrong but I ain't shocked
Absorbed blows, I should've hit the floor but I ain't drop
Treated like the average Joe but I ain't slop
Only sandwich I been handing out is knuckle, blah!
Wonder how I stay winning like a flame hitting oxygen
Try to penetrate my lane but I ain't flop
Hand in hand with my comrades, congrats we finally made it
Try and take the place of desperation here within
Kick with Tims, know it all to own it all
I'mma fall but I'mma rise and fly beyond the protocol
I'm certain that my curtain call is sure to be a work of art
I'mma show these motherfucks what I've been working on
Listen up, risen up, dust been picking up trudge through it
Know the tension is thick, so thick you could cut through it
No thinking you just do it, pull through the storm
Bright red flags wave, bull by the horns

Yeah, yeah
I always knew I had it in me to push through
Cause see there's nothing, no nothing I wouldn't do
Set the table, anyway I'mma put food
By any means chase dreams and push through
{x2}
Push, push

Something's got to give
Yeah

When I was twelve I told myself I didn't have another option
My only focus was to focus on the dopest shit I ever wrote
And put emotion in it until I'm blood clotting
Never mind I wasn't blind so yes I was watching
Lookin' at the constellations saw Copernicus
Contemplating how the earth, it sits
Cocentric with other planets so the entire world is fucking wrong
Go ahead and tell them this song was written
By that poor little Capricorn who knows whose fucking turn it is
So I'm indifferent to the belligerence
Tell me my sacrificial lifestyle isn't beginning to become indicative
Of the fucked up conditions that I've been living in
Look at me right now, tell me it isn't deliberate
Everything that I was meant for, everything that I had bled for
Looked in my eye and commenced war
Without anyone thinking I had stepped towards
Took all of my life I didn't deserve people I missed, bridges I burned
Life that I gave up isn't returned
Look at my life I know it's been earned
Let's go

They're going to tell you it's impossible
They're going to tell you that it's one in a million
They're going to say that you're illogical
But if it's brilliant and the people fucking feel it
There will be no conversation
And when you die you can look them in the eye
And say at least I know I tried, at least I know I tried
And when you die you can look them in the eyes
And say at least I fucking tried
At least I fucking triedEmbed
