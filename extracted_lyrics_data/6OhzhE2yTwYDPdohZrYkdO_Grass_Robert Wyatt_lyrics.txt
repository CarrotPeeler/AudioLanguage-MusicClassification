And I shall come and sit beside you
Go and sit upon the grass
And I shall come and sit beside you
And we shall talk
And while we talk I’ll hit your head with a nail to make you understand me
While we talk I’ll hit your head with a nail to make you understand me
Go and sit upon the grass
And I shall come and sit beside you
Go and sit upon the grass
And I shall come and sit beside you
And do not mind if I thump you when I’m talking to you
Do not mind if I thump you when I’m talking to you
I’ve something important to say
Go and sit upon the grass
And I shall come and sit beside you
Go and sit upon the grass
And I shall come and sit beside you
And when I’m gone you can feel the lumps upon your head
And think about what I said
And think about what I said

And feel your lumpsEmbed
