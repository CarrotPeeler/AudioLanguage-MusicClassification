1 ContributorDo Ya Wanna Funk Lyrics
There is something
I wanna ask you
There is something
That I want to know
And to the question
You have the answer
So tell me
What I want to know

Do you wanna funk
Won't you tell me now
If you wanna funk
Let me show you how
Do you wanna funk with me
Do you wanna funk with me

So if I tell you
That you're really something, baby
Will you stay, or will you go away
(Don't go away)
And when I lay my
Good lovin' on ya
What will it cost me, baby
What will you make me pay
You might also like
Do you wanna funk
Won't you tell me now
If you wanna funk
Let me show you how
Do you wanna funk with me
Do you wanna funk with me

Oh, do you wanna funk
Won't you tell me now
If you wanna funk
Let me show you how
Do you wanna funk with me
Do you wanna funk with me
Oh...!Embed
