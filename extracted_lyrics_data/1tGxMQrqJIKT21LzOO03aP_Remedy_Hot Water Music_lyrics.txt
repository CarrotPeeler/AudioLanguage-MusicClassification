10 ContributorsRemedy Lyrics
I need a remedy of diesel and dust
Something I can taste, with a fix I can trust
Another high
More potent than lust
Eating and repeating like the workings of rust and time

Woke to the sound and the rhythm of rain
Dancing down on the window pane
Comatose
Eyes half-closed
Arms wrapped up with the wounds all sewn
I'm froze from head to toe
Clenched the jaw
Then felt my body roll over slow

I must live to know
Healing takes some time

So no, no regrets
No looking back to sinking ships
So I'll strip the gauze for a rational self-analysis
I'm down
Cut and bound
Counting scars
Counting blessings loud, so loud

I must live to know
That time alone is always
(No regrets or falling fits)
Healing
(I'll strip the gauze and bleed it)
As long as there's
(No regrets or falling fits)
Bleeding
(I'll strip the gauze and bleed it)

Always (No regrets or falling fits)
Healing (I'll strip the gauze and bleed it)
As long as there's (No regrets or falling fits)
Bleeding (I'll strip the gauze and bleed it)
There's no (No regrets or falling fits)
Worry (I'll strip the gauze and bleed it)
It's only (No regrets or falling fits)
A simple therapy (I'll strip the gauze and bleed it)Embed
