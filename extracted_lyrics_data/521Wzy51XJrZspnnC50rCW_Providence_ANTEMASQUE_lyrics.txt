4 ContributorsProvidence LyricsStaring back from his fate
Wearing ankles of chrome
He's holding the answer he loathes
Sharing 6 beds for 24 deaths
If you long to be gored, you'll come back
Holding his hands up to the glass
Biting his tongue, time has run out
You better burn, you better burn me at the stake
You better burn, you better burn me at the stake
You better burn, you better burn me at the stake
Because providence she don't live here anymore
From the swine to the drain it's the price he must pay
He can't hold his breath for too long
The sharper the shackles, the colder the bones
For a mare's nest devours its own
Holding his hands up to the glass
Biting his tongue, time has run out
You better burn, you better burn me at the stake
You better burn, you better burn me at the stake
You better burn, you better burn me at the stake
Because providence she don't live here anymore
(She don't live here anymore)
(She don't live here anymore)
(She don't live here anymore)
