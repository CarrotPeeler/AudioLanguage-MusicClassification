1 ContributorIs You Is or Is You Ainâ€™t My Baby? LyricsI got a gal who's always late
Any time we have a date
But I love her
Yes, I love her
I'm gonna walk right up to her gate
See if I can get it straight
'Cause I want her
I'm gonna ask her
Is you is, is you ain't my baby
The way you acting lately makes me doubt
You still my baby, baby
Seems my flame in your heart's done gone out
A woman is a creature that has always been strange
Just when you're sure of one
You find she's gone and made a change
Now, is you is or is you ain't my baby
Maybe baby's found somebody new
Or is my baby still my baby true
A woman is a creature that has always been strange
Just when you're sure of one
You find she's gone and made a change
You might also likeNow, is you is or is you ain't my baby
Maybe baby's found somebody new
Or is my baby still my baby true
Now, darling, tell me is you is or is you ain't my baby
Or has my baby found somebody newEmbed
