2 ContributorsThe Ghost Of You and I LyricsYou'll find in time the brightest flame will slowly die
And bear the darkest night to rise
When everything that's meant to shine
Burns out before your eyes
Tonight we're longing for daylight, burning the same lie
To find the ghost of you and I
We're running from midnight, dying to ignite
To find the ghost of you and I
Yeah, 'cause tonight the fire that we hold inside
That once would burn so bright
Denied and buried by a thousand eyes
That fights to keep you blind
Tonight we're longing for daylight, burning the same lie
To find the ghost of you and I
We're running for midnight, dying to ignite
To find the ghost of you and I
To find the ghost of you and I
To find the ghost of you and I
This was the day I feared the most
When all that's left inside is a memory and the ghost
Of everything we know
Ooh yeah, the memory of everything we know
And I already know

To find the ghost of you and I
We're longing for daylight, burning the same lie
To find the ghost of you and I
We're running for midnight, dying to ignite
To find the ghost of you and I
To find the ghost of you and I
To find the ghost of you and IEmbed
