1 ContributorDaniel LyricsAt the water's edge
That's where I make my bed
No TV radiation
To fill up my head
My eyes are blue like you
Our babies will be born blue
I wait all day it's torture
He's got something to say that's for sure
He looks alright outside
But he feels so bad inside
He looks so good on the outside
But he feels so bad inside
At the water's edge
That's where I lay my head
With rocks in your pockets
You float on your back
You're drowning in your bed
I watch the birds and bunnies
You look so small and lonely
I live on sugar and honey
This is the sound of no money

But he feels so bad inside
He looks so good on the outside
But he feels so bad inside
He looks alright outside
But he feels so bad inside
He looks alright outside
But he feels so bad inside
He looks so good on the outside
But he feels so bad inside
Daniel
He looks alright outside
But he feels so bad inside
Daniel
He looks so good on the outside
But he feels so bad insideEmbed
