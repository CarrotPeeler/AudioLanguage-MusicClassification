When I need to replace her
I am the mind eraser
Anything goes, yeah, anything goes

Got this sin in our brain
But she ain't gonna see me again, see me again
This I know, but oh, deep down
I can't let go

Oh, don't let it be over, over oh
No, don't let it be over, let it be over, oh

Seein' me stack up my woes
Into a wall around a rose, 'round a rose
Now she knows, oh, it hurts so
I can't let go

Oh, don't let it be over, over oh
No, don't let it be over, let it be over, oh

Oh, don't let it be over, over oh
No, don't let it be over, let it be over, ohSee The Black Keys LiveGet tickets as low as $83You might also like1Embed
