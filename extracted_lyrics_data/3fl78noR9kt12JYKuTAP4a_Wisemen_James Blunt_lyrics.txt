29 ContributorsWisemen Lyrics
She said to me, "Go steady on me"
Won't you tell me what the wise men said
When they came down from heaven
Smoked nine till seven
All the shit that they could find

But they couldn't escape from you
Couldn't be free of you
And now they know there's no way out
And they're really sorry now for what they've done
They were three wise men just tryna have some fun

Look who's alone now
It's not me, it's not me
Those three wise men
They've got a semi by the sea
Gotta ask yourself the question
Where are you now?
Gotta ask yourself the question
Where are you now?

Really sorry now, they weren't to know
They got caught up in your talent show
With you pernickety little bastards in your fancy dress
Who just judge each other and try to impress
See James Blunt LiveGet tickets as low as $47You might also like
But they couldn't escape from you
Couldn't be free of you
And now they know there's no way out
And they're really sorry now for what they've done
They were three wise men just tryna have some fun

Look who's alone now
It's not me, it's not me
Those three wise men
They've got a semi by the sea
Gotta ask yourself the question
Where are you now?
Gotta ask yourself the question
Where are you now?


Look who's alone now
It's not me, it's not me
Those three wise men
They've got a semi by the sea
Gotta ask yourself the question
Where are you now?
Gotta ask yourself the question
Where are you now?
Where are you now?
Where are you now?

Gotta ask yourself the question
Where are you now?
Gotta ask yourself the question
Where are you now?5Embed
