11 ContributorsNever Lyrics
Ooh, oh, yeah, yeah
Woah, woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah, woah

Hey, baby, I'm talkin' to you
Stop yourself and listen
Some things, you can never choose
Even if you try, yeah
You're bangin' your head again
'Cause somebody won't let you in
One chance, one love
Your chance to let me know

We can't go on just runnin' away
If we stay any longer, we will surely never get away
Oh, oh, anything you want, we can make it happen
Stand up and turn around, never let them shoot us down

Never
Never
Never
Never run away

Hey, baby, you know it's true
Why you bother lyin'
When you know that, that you want it too?
Don't you dare deny me
Now walk those legs right over here
Give me what I'm dying for
One chance, one love
Hold me down, never let me go

We can't go on just runnin' away
If we wait any longer, we will surely never get away
Oh, oh, anything you want, we can make it happen
Stand up and turn around, never let them shoot us down

Never (No, no, no, no)
Never run away
Hey, baby, I'm talkin' to you
Stop yourself and listen
Some things, you can never, never choose
Even if you try, yeah
You're bangin' your head again
'Cause somebody won't let you in
One chance, one love
Your chance to let me know

We can't go on just runnin' away
If we stay any longer, we will surely never get away

Oh, oh

We can't go on
Never
We can't go on
Never

Ne-ne-ne-never
Oh, oh
