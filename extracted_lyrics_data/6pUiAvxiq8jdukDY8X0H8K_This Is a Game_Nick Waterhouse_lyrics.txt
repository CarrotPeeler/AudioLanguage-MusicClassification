2 ContributorsThis Is a Game Lyrics
Well, this is a game
I wish it wasn't so
Oh, before we get started
There's one thing about it
That you should know:
Well, that this is a game
Please remember my words
And don't get upset
When you don't get
What you think you deserve, oh

Oh, this is a game
You get visions of thieves;
What you deck stack
Get taken back
And turned up sleeves, oh
But this is a game
And those who play with skill
Ain't quite saying it's do or die
But anyway
You're gonna get killed, oh

Yeah, this is a game
Well, this is a game
Yeah, this is a game
Well, this is a game
