1 ContributorCowâ€™s Placenta To Armageddon LyricsWhile investigating a cows placenta
A lab technician stumbles and activates a
DNA-mutating virus
DNA-mutating virus from hell
Which causes his body to transform grotesquely
Into a plasmic knot with a widow's peak and dissolving skin
But not before he goes slowly insane
Not before he dies slowly in pain
And unfortunately he spreads the disease to his
Unsuspecting friends and neighbors causing a calamity
Of world dimensions as the plague spreads
World dimensions as the plague spreads
And because human beings are cruel and barbaric
Vigilante committees form which persecute the infected
The earth becomes a bloodbath hell
The earth becomes a bloody hell
Until someway somehow a nuclear holocaust is cast
Causing every single form of life on the planet to dieYou might also likeEmbed
