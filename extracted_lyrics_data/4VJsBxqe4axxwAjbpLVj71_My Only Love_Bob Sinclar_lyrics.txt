1 ContributorMy Only Love LyricsI love the way you get next to me
You take my love so much higher, oh
Yes, set my body on fire, burn me up in my bones
I give you every desire, I fill you up with my love, with my love
You are my only love
You are my only love
You are my only love
You are my only love
Baby, can't tell
What I feel for you
What you give to me
Baby, baby, that'd be crazy
I get my body in motion
You turn me up with this stuff
My heart is filled with emotion
Fill me up with your love, baby, keep it coming
You are my only love
I said, you are, baby, my only love
You are my only love
I said, you are my only love
You're the only love, the only love
You're the only love, the only one I love
You're the only love, the only love
You're the only love, the only one I love
