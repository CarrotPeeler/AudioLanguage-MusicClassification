(Can you turn me up a bit?)
King kong kitchee kitchee ki-mi-o 

Well frog went a-courtin' and he did ride
With a sword and a pistol by his side
And he rode 'til he came to Miss Mouse's door
And then he knelt right down upon the floor
He said, "Little Miss Mouse, will you marry me
Way down yonder in the hollow tree
With an owl and a bat and a bumblebee?"
(Shoop shoop, shoop shoop)

Miss Mouse had suitors, three or four
And they came rushing through the door
Well they grabbed Miss Mouse and began to fight
In the hollow tree; it was a terrible night
Yeah, "Little Miss Mouse, will you marry me
Way down yonder in the hollow tree
With an owl and a bat and a bumblebee?"
Yeah! Yeah!

Mr Frog threw her suitors to the floor
And with his sword and his pistol he killed them all
And they went to the vicar the very next day
And they left on their honeymoon right away
Oh glory, glory, glory be
Way down yonder in the hollow tree
With an owl and a bat and a bumblebeeSee Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds LiveGet tickets as low as $59You might also likeEmbed
