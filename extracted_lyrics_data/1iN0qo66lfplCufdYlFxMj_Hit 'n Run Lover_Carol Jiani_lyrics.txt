2 ContributorsHit â€™N Run Lover LyricsI was waiting for my lover to change
He was going much too fast
When he suddenly touched me it felt so right
But he's ran away in the middle of the night
He's a hit 'n run lover
He'll get to you when you're down
That hit 'n run lover
He'll let you go and then he'll get out of town
We'll spill our tears, then angry words
Then the sounds of breaking hearts
I survived, shook the head and sighed
It's just a bad intersection I replied
He's a hit 'n run lover
He'll get to you when you're down
That hit 'n run lover
He'll let you go and then he'll get out of town
It might seem heartless, it might seem cruel
But you can't arrest him when you play the fool
Ooohooohooohooo
Hit 'n run, yeah, yeah
Oooh, hit 'n run lover
Hit 'n run, yeah, yeah
Baby
You might also likeHit 'n run lover
He can hit, hit, hit 'n run
Hit, hit, hit 'n run
Now let them hear when your mind's in a fall
And you think he's just your kind
Oooh, don't turn around, you might get hurt
He can hit you from behind, 'cause
He's a hit 'n run lover
He'll get to you when you're down
That hit 'n run lover
He'll let you go, then he'll get out of town
It might seem heartless, it might seem cruel
But you can't arrest him when you play the fool
Ooohooohooohooo
Hit 'n run, hit 'n run
It might seem heartless, it might seem cruel
But you can't arrest him when you play the fool
Ooohooohooohooo
Hit 'n run, hit 'n run lover, yeah, yeahEmbed
