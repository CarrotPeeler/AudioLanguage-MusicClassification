5 ContributorsLosing U Lyrics
For all nations
New combination
DJ Kore, Feenix ENT
And your girl Amerie
One thing for sure
It's Ra√Ø'n'B fever

I see you in the crowd, look over my shoulder
Maybe I'll tell you now, tell you that it's over
I know you wanna talk, you call my phone three times
But I can't take you now, yes I've made up my mind

No! I won't take you back
(I gave you many chances)
No! I won't change my mind
(Can't you understand it?)
No! You can't come back home
(Under no circumstances)
Yes! C'est la vie, I'm gone
(Ain't no second chances)

Na-na-na, na-na-na
Na-na-na, na-na-na
Losing you was so easy to do (Easy for me)
Na-na-na, na-na-na
Na-na-na, na-na-na
Losing you was the best thing that happened to me
You might also like
You say you've tried to change, give you just one more time
I know you'll stay the same, sick and tired of your lies
I used to trust you and I didn't see the sign
But I can't take you now, yes I've made up my mind

No! I won't take you back
(I gave you many chances)
No! I won't change my mind
(Can't you understand it?)
No! You can't come back home
(Under no circumstances)
Yes! C'est la vie, I'm gone
(Ain't no second chances)

Na-na-na, na-na-na
Na-na-na, na-na-na
Losing you was so easy to do (Easy for me)
Na-na-na, na-na-na
Na-na-na, na-na-na
Losing you was the best thing that happened to me

By now you know that this is over (Over for you)
And it's not something you'll get over (Nothing you can do)
So when you are alone
Remember how it felt to hold me
Na-na-na, na-na-na
Na-na-na, na-na-na
Losing you was so easy to do (Easy for me)
Na-na-na, na-na-na
Na-na-na, na-na-na
Losing you was the best thing that happened to me

Na-na-na, na-na-na
Na-na-na, na-na-na
Losing you was so easy to do (Easy for me)
Na-na-na, na-na-na
Na-na-na, na-na-na
Losing you was the best thing that happened to meEmbed
