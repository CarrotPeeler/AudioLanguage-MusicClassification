Suburbia, where the suburbs met utopia
Where the suburbs met utopia

Lost in the high street, where the dogs run
Roaming suburban boys
Mother's got her hair-do to be done
She says they're too old for toys
Stood by the bus stop with a felt pen
In this suburban hell
And in the distance a police car
To break the suburban spell

Let's take a ride
And run with the dogs tonight
In suburbia
You can't hide
Run with the dogs tonight
In suburbia

Break the window by the Town Hall
Listen! A siren screams
There in the distance
Like a roll call
Of all the suburban dreams
You might also like
Let's take a ride
And run with the dogs tonight
In suburbia
You can't hide
Run with the dogs tonight
In suburbia


I only wanted something else to do but hang around
I only wanted something else to do but hang around
Hang around, hang around


It's on the front page of the papers:
"This Is Their Hour of Need"
Where's a policeman when you need one
To blame the colour TV?

Let's take a ride
And run with the dogs tonight
In suburbia
You can't hide
Run with the dogs tonight
In suburbia, in suburbia, in suburbia
Run with the dogs tonight
You can't hide
Run with the dogs tonight
You can't hide
In suburbia


Suburbia, where the suburbs met utopia
What kind of dream was this, so easy to destroy?
And who are were to blame for the sins of the past?
These slums of the future?
Suburbia, where the suburbs met utopia
Suburbia, where the suburbs met utopia
Where the suburbs met utopiaEmbed
