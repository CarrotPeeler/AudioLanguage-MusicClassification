"Es ist nur ein Schritt vom Küssen zum Töten."

You beat me down and I crawl on the floor
You lift me up and I'm begging for more
You know by now what I fucking abhor
Don't ever stop it's never enough
You fill my heart with your terrible lies
And then again I see truth in your eyes
You always know what I fucking despise
Don't ever think it's too much, too much

Come on, come on, come on, come on
Rule me, you hold my life in one hand
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Fool me, so many things to pretend

Kiss me! Rape me!
Deflorate me!
Love me! Trick me!
Come and kick me!

You scrape my scar and you scratch on the nerve
You make it heal and I'm begging to serve
You know the best what I fucking deserve
Don't ever stop it's never enough
You've got the cure and I'm begging you, please
Come fill me up with another disease
You'll always be such a fucking release
Don't ever think it's too much
You might also like
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Rule me, you hold my life in one hand
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Fool me, so many things to pretend

Kiss me! Rape me!
Deflorate me!
Love me! Trick me!
Come and kick me!

Come!
Come!
Come!
Come!

Kiss me! Rape me!
Deflorate me!
Love me! Trick me!
Come and kick me!
Kiss me! Rape me!
(You give me reason to live)
Deflorate me!
(You give me anything)
Love me! Trick me!
(You give me reason to live)
Come and kick me!
(You give me anything)
Come!
Come!
Come!
Come!

Kiss me! Rape me!
Deflorate me!
Love me! Trick me!
Come and kick me!
Kiss me! Rape me!
(You give me reason to live)
Deflorate me!
(You give me anything)
Love me! Trick me!
(You give me reason to live)
Come and kick me!
(You give me anything)

Come!
Come!
Come!
Come!Embed
