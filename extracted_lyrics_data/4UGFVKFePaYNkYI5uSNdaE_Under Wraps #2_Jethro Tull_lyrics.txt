3 ContributorsUnder Wraps #2 LyricsKeep it quiet. (Go slow.)
Circulate. Need to know
Stamp the date upon your file ---
Masquerade, but well worth while
Wrapped in the warmth of you ---
Wrapped up in your smile
Wrapped in the folds of your attention
Wear an air --- (keep mum)
Of casual indifference
Careful how you go
About your usual business
Wrapped in daydreams of you ---
Wrapped up by your eyes
Wrapped in the folds of your attention
Under wraps! I've got you under wraps
Tell you when --- (not yet)
Soon the great unveiling
Bless my boots! Upon my soul!
Secrecy, it is my failing
Wrapped in your Summer night ---
Wrapped in your Autumn leaves
Wrapped in the Winter of your sleepingSee Jethro Tull LiveGet tickets as low as $60You might also likeEmbed
