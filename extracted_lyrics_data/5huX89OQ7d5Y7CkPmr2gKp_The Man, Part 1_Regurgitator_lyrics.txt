1 ContributorThe Man: Part 1 Lyrics
There he goes, just walking down the street
He's a big piece of man with a big piece of meat
He's brash in a flash, he's got a fist full of cash
He's keeping his cool while he's making his dash
He's got a smile that says trouble and a fist that says love
He'll burst your bubble like death from above
He's a man with a mission, a fire in the hole
He's hormones raging out of control

He's the man
He's the man
Let's go

There she goes, just walking down the street
She's a plastic wrapped candy bar with pumps on her feet
She's got a glamourous stink you smell from miles around
And when she barks on by, she drags her sex on the ground
She's got chemical hair, she'll flick it in your face
She keeps a silicon spare and and a bottle of mace
She doesn't know what she wants but she'll get it for free
'Cause she's got more curves than the Monte Grand Prix

She's the man
She's the man
She's the man
That's right, she's the man
You might also like
Oi, oi, oi, oi
Oi, oi, oi, oi
Oi, oi, oi, oi
Oi, oi, oi

He's on the go hard pills and he's looking for you
Cocked and loaded in a world turned blue
She's a sweet wee lass who's good for a laugh
Looking for a gentleman to blow it up her arse
He's a stiff messiah, hot off the cross
She's a burning pyre made of candy floss
DJ Moses uniting the drugged
Jesus and Mary, man it must be love

You're the man
You're the man
You're the man
That's right, you're the manEmbed
