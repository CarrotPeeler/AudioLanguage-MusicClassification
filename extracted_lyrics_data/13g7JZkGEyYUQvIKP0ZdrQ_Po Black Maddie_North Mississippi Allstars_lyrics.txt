1 ContributorPo Black Maddie LyricsPo black Maddie got no change of clothes
Fool got drunk and her clothes outdoors
Po black Maddie ain't got no change o' clothes
Fool got drunk and throw her trunk outdoors
Need no heat or fireplace by my bed
Woman I got, cherry red
Need no heater or fireplace by my bed
Woman I got keeps me cherry red
Woman I got keeps me cherry red
Goin to Memphis to see the worldly fair
Reason I'm goin cause my baby's there
Goin to Memphis, goin to see that worldly fair
Reason I'm goin cause my baby's there
Reason I'm goin cause my baby's there
(reprise)
