8 ContributorsSpecial Death Lyrics
A terrible mistake was made
The weight would break the backs
Of ten strong horses tried to save
The castle in the fray
If you knew that I could take the pain
Inflicted at the battle
With faithful arrows
You might get back in the saddle
But it's a special death you saved
For me, the brown-eyed daughter
Once you made it hotter
The thankless, holy praise
Is left alone, why bother
To cast a stone in water?
