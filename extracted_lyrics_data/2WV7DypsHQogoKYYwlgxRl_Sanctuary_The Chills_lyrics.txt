1 ContributorSanctuary Lyrics
The engine is hot, and the wind is wild
Come on, darling, don't tarry
Aren't you weary of dreams and hard-luck schemes?
This'll be our sanctuary
Well, the car is warm from the chill outside
That can creep into your bones
I was trying to remember if I'd brought everything
But there's nothing that you really own

Caution to the wind
Caution to the wind
Caution to the wind
You can never go back again

We have tried for years to play by the rules
On the ladder of success
And I was stepping up to make the first rung
And saw this vision of my brokenness
And well, then, since that time, I became an inspector
Storm damage done for life
I've been picking up the pieces of my might-have-beens
And I hold them up to the light
You might also like
Caution to the wind
Caution to the wind
Caution to the wind
You can never go back again

Ho!

Far as the East is the from the West
Deeper than the deepest ocean
I been running all my life on borrowed feelings
Devoid of emotion
And the windshield wipers are counting time
Too heavy for us to carry
Oh, was that a whisper of the Holy Ghost?
This'll be our sanctuary

Caution to the wind
Caution to the wind
Caution to the wind
You can never go back again
Caution to the wind
Caution to the wind
Caution to the wind
You can never go back again
This'll be our sanctuary
This'll be our sanctuary
This'll be our sanctuaryEmbed
