4 ContributorsI See You Lyrics
(Al Geno on the track)
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Lovin' you for you to leave
I guess we can call it wasted time
We spendin' weeks overseas
So just watch how quick your days go by
Like the defense on Kyrie Irving, I left your legs shakin'
She ain't from Georgia, but she be fussin', then we baby-makin'
All them times that I had you runnin', my last name should be Reagan
It's an emergency, can I see you? Can I see you? Can I see you?
I was givin' you scars that I wasn't tryna heal
Too busy chasin' Jacksons, shit that you wasn't tryna feel
I'm a G, bought you the Wagon, that shit that you be tryna whip
I didn't know my grind would make us both get out of here
Patek is two-tone, and I bought us two of 'em
Got on three watches, but only got two arms
Red interior, top disappeared

Ridin' through Miami, I'm bumpin' Yung Bleu songs
The love plug got from my heart, then you would run off
I'm tryna tell you that ain't smart, you will get knocked off
Jump up in my passenger, let's ride through the South
Can show you where the blood was left, they killer was never caught
Can show you where they sellin' weed and where they servin' raw
But I'd probably just be wastin' my time
My pain probably don't matter
'Cause you only see the money and the fame
It's hard to see I'm unhappy

Like the defense on Kyrie Irving, I left your legs shakin'
She ain't from Georgia, but she be fussin', then we baby-makin'
All them times that I had you runnin', my last name should be Reagan
It's an emergency, can I see you? Can I see you? Can I see you?
I was givin' you scars that I wasn't tryna heal
Too busy chasin' Jacksons, shit that you wasn't tryna feel
I'm a G, bought you the Wagon, that shit that you be tryna whip
I didn't know my grind would make us both get out of here
Patek is two-tone, and I bought us two of 'em
Got on three watches, but only got two arms
Red interior, top disappeared
(Lovin' you for you to leave
I guess we can call it wasted time)

You don't right your wrongs, but you light the room
Without diamonds on, without diamonds on
If they play, get buried, and we make the bond
Every base we bought, is you comin' home?
Is you comin' home?

Lovin' you for you to leave
I guess we can call it wasted time
We spendin' weeks overseas
So just watch how quick your days go by
Like the defense on Kyrie Irving, I left your legs shakin'
She ain't from Georgia, but she be fussin', then we baby-makin'
All them times that I had you runnin', my last name should be Reagan
It's an emergency, can I see you? Can I see you? Can I see you?Embed
