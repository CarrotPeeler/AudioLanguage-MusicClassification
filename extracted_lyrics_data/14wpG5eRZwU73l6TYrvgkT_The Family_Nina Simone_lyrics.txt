6 ContributorsThe Family Lyrics
The weevils all took to cotton, and the cows all took to dry
What the varmints left behind, the sun took up to die
Trouble took to Daddy like dew drops take to night
Mama took to cryin' a lot and Daddy took to wine

And I took a train outta there (Took a train outta there)
I told the engineer I don't believe there's no help handy
(Don't believe it)
Heaven help the tie that binds a family
Heaven help the tie that binds a family
Heaven help the tie that binds a family

Flowers took to Daddy and Daddy, he took to calm
Sister took to black wheel nights and Mama cried alone
Brother, he took up preaching and the bank man took the farm (Took it)
They came and took my mom away, she can't do herself no harm

And I took a train outta there
I told the engineer I don't believe there's no help handy
(Don't believe it)
Heaven help the tie that binds a family
Heaven help the tie that binds a family
Heaven help the tie that binds a family

Looks like even God can't save the family
Looks like only, looks like only God can save the family
And I took a train outta there
I told the engineer I don't believe there?s no help handy
