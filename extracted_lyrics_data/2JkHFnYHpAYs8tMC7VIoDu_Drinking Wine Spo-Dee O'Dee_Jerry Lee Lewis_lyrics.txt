2 ContributorsDrinking Wine Spo-Dee Oâ€™Dee Lyrics(1966, Memphis Beat version)
Down in New Orleans where everything's fine
All them cats is drinkin' that wine
Drinkin' that mess is their delight
When they get drunk, they singin' all night
Drinkin' wine spo-dee-o-dee drinkin' wine
Wine spo-dee-o-dee drinkin' wine
Wine spo-dee-o-dee drinkin' wine
Pass that bottle to me
Now I've got a nickel, honey, you got a dime
Let's get together, gonna have a little wine
I buy it by the gallon I buy it by the quart
When you buy blackberry now you're doin' things smart
Drinkin' wine spo-dee-o-dee drinkin' wine
Wine spo-dee-o-dee drinkin' wine
Wine spo-dee-o-dee drinkin' wine
Pass that bottle to me
Well, I was standing on Bourbon Street in Willie's den
Papa Willie wouldn't sell but a little gin
One cat wanted a bottle of wine
He hooked that cat for a dollar and a dime
