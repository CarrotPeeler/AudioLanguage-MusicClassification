These arms of mine
They are lonely, lonely, and feeling blue
These arms of mine
They are yearning, yearning from wanting you

And if you would let them hold you
Oh, how grateful I would be

These arms of mine
They are burning, burning from wanting you
These arms of mine
They are wanting, wanting, wanting to hold you

And if you would let them hold you
Oh, how grateful I would be

Come on, come on, baby
Just be my man, just, just be my lover
I need me somebody to treat me right
And I need somebody to hold me tonight
And I need your tender lip to kiss me tonight
Mmm
