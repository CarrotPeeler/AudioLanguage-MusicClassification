4 ContributorsAre You Receiving Me? LyricsAre you receiving me?
You are deceiving me I know
See, I know
Are you receiving me?
You are deceiving me I know
See, I know
When we're out walking
Your mouth ain't where it's supposed to do the talking
When we're in kissing
Your lips are missing, are they out on loan to someone else?
Are you listening?
Are you receiving me?
You are deceiving me I know, see, I know
Are you receiving me?
You are deceiving me I know
See, I know
When we're out walking
Your mouth ain't where it's supposed to do the talking
When we're in kissing
Your lips are missing, are they out on loan to someone else?
Are you listening?
Are you receiving me?
You are deceiving me I know, see, I know
Are you receiving me?
You are deceiving me I know
See, I know
You might also likeI put it in a letter, what could be better?
I put it in a note, one night, I wrote
I put it in a telegram, just like the son of Sam
Babe, there's something missing
Your TV's just hissing
Are you receiving me?
You are deceiving me I know, see, I know
Are you receiving me?
You are deceiving me I know
See, I know
Are you receiving me?
Are you receiving me?
Are you receiving me?
Are you receiving me?Embed
