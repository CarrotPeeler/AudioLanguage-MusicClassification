I don't mind as long you're with me
Don't care as long as you give me
A winter in the sun
Been through so many seasons
Now I know my winter is coming
With you I found a good reason
For playing in the sun
Wherever I go
I feel warm by your side
Let the cold wind blow
As long as you're mine
I feel like playing in the sand
Every time I hold your hand
My sweet summer days are in your eyes
Keep on dancing baby
I don't mind if you don't dance with me
Don't care as long as you give me
A winter in the sun
Blue sky won't last forever
Now I know my dark cloud is coming
Please make it last a bit longer
My winter in the sun
Wherever I go
I feel warm by your side
Let the cold wind blow
As long as you're mine
I feel like playing in the sand
Every time i hold your hand
My sweet summer days are in your eyes
A winter in the sun x2You might also likeEmbed
