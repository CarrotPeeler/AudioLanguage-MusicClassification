Rise of the fallen
Stars gleam and sway
Unbound spirits
Forging destinies way
In the thunderous rhythm
Night turns to day
Witness our ascension
Power reclaimed

Rise of the fallen
Rise of—

The whole world bows
Power
Stars gleam and sway

The saga of strength
The battle cries call
Our anthem of triumph
The greatest of all

Rise of the fallen
Stars gleam and sway
Unbound spirits
Forging destinies way
In the thunderous rhythm
Night turns to day
The whole world bows to our triumph and display

Rise of the fallen
Power reclaimed
Rise of the fallen
We stand tall
Rise of the fallenEmbed
