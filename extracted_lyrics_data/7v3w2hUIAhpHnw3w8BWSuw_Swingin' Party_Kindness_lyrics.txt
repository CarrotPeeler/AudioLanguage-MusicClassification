Bring your own lampshade, somewhere there's a party
Here it's never endin', can't remember when it started
Pass around the lampshade
There'll be plenty enough room in jail

If bein' wrong's a crime, I'm serving forever
If bein' strong's your kind
Then I need help here with this feather
If bein' afraid is a crime, we hang side by side
At the swingin' party down the line
At the swingin' party down the line

Pound the prairie pavement, losin' proposition
Quittin' school and goin' to work and never goin' fishin'
Water all around, never learned how to swim now

If bein' wrong's a crime, I'm serving forever
If bein' strong's your kind
Then I need help here with this feather
If bein' afraid is a crime, we hang side by side
At the swingin' party down the line
At the swingin' party down the line

Bring your own lampshade, somewhere there's a party
Here it's never endin', can't remember when it started
Pass around the lampshade
There'll be plenty enough room in jail

If bein' wrong's a crime, I'm serving forever
If bein' strong is what you want
Then I need help here with this feather
If bein' afraid is a crime, we hang side by side
At the swingin' party down the line
At the swingin' party down the line
Catch you down at the swingin' party down the line4Embed
