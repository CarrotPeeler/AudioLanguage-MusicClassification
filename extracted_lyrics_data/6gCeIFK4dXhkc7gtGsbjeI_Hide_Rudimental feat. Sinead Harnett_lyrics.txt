Won’t give up (I want you)
Won’t give up (go away)
Till I’m high
Won’t give up

November phone call, on the hotline
You see the picture, every single sign
I got a secret
But can you keep it?
If tears had balance, what would life be?
You and me would be quite likely
But you see this
I’m still a misfit

I see you
Running in circles tryna find me
Blindfolded
With only the darkness you’re unable to see
I’m not there
I’m not there
And to tell you the truth you should cut me loose
I’m nowhere, nowhere
See Rudimental LiveGet tickets as low as $122You might also like
So I hide myself away
To another place
I hide
Between the sheets
So you don’t see me
Try, to masquerade
Wear another face
I won’t give up, no
Hiding in lies cause inside I'm so weak

Won’t give up (I want you)
Won’t give up (go away)
Till I’m high
Won’t give up(go away)

Tell another lie, commit another sin
This he says she says is wearing you thin and you know it
But you don’t show it
To free you
Is something I'm trying so hard to do
Unfolded, now you’re so vulnerable
I’ve gotten through
I am scared, so, so scared
And to tell you the truth, this is nothing new
So why care? Why care?
So I hide myself away
To another place
I hide
Between the sheets
So you don’t see me
Try, to masquerade
Wear another face
I won’t give up, no
Hiding in lies cause inside I'm so weak

Won’t give up (I want you)
Won’t give up (go away)
Till I’m high
Won’t give up
Won’t give up (I want you)
Won’t give up
Till I’m high
I’ve been in lots of, inside out so I
Won’t give up (I want you)
Won’t give up (go away)
Till I’m high
Won’t give up(go away)
Won’t give up (I want you)
Won’t give up(I want you)
Till I’m high
Won’t give up(go away)
So I hide myself away
To another place
I hide
Between the sheets
So you don’t see me
Try, to masquerade
Wear another face
I won’t give up, no
Hiding in lies cause inside I'm so weak2Embed
