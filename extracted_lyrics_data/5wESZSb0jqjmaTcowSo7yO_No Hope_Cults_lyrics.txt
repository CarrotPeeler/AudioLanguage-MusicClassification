9 ContributorsNo Hope Lyrics
Come so defeated
It all turned to gray
The days much colder and there's not much left to say
Try to stop from shaking
Want to feel you close
You kept your distance when I needed you the most

The sun won't rise
It never shines
I know you're mine
But still I die

It makes no difference
If we turn away
No hope for me now and I'm better off that way
Only left a moment
That's all it took
No stopping me now
Foundations shook
Burn down the bridges
Burn down the town
Forget tomorrow
No lights around
Search all the ditches
And all the sounds
That joy you borrowed
Won't come around
You might also like
The sun won't rise
It never shines
I know you're mine
But still I die

There's no hope
No hope
No hope
For the wicked inside my soul
No hope
No hope
No hope
For the wicked or the good
No hope
No hope
No hope
For the wicked inside my soul
No hope
No hope
No hope
For the wicked or the goodEmbed
