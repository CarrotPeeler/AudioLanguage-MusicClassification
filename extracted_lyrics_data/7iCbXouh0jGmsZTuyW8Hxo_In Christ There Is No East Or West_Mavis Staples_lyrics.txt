1 ContributorIn Christ There Is No East Or West LyricsIn Christ there is no East or West
No North or South;
Only one great love
Inside and out
True hearts everywhere
Some deaf and some blind
Singin' one melody
Lost souls cannot find
Join hands and have faith
Whatever your race may be!
Who serves my Father as a son
Is surely kin to me
In Christ now meet both East and West
There is no black or white
Only one great love
Hatred cannot divide
Join hands and have faith
Forgive your enemy
Surely we're all a part
Of one big family
Join hands and have faith
Whatever your race may be!
Who serves my Father as a son
Is surely kin to me
