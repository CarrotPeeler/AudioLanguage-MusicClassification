6 ContributorsPhoenix Ignition Lyrics
Like a phoenix ignition
Like a crematorium
Like a swelling volition
From the barrel of a gun
From the ashes and the embers
Like a rocket I'll ascend
Like a cry gone up for a fallen friend
Like a cry gone up for a fallen...

Like a phoenix ignition
Like a crematorium
Like a swelling volition
From the barrel of a gun
From the ashes and the embers
Like a rocket I'll ascend
Like a cry gone up for a fallen friend
I'll ascend!

Every day tear down these walls
'Til cornerstones remain
Coming one step closer all the time
And although we'll never reach perfection
Always persist to try
No regrets
You might also like
No regrets
Just rebirth
Move forward
And ignite

Reinvention
A new renaissance
A new fire each day
A new fire each day
