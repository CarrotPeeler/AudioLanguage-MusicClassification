Hey, Mona
Ooh, Mona
Yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah, Mona
Oh, Mona

Hey, Mona, what I wanna do
Build my house next door to you
Can I see you sometime?
We could go kissing through the blind

Can you come out in the front?
Listen to my heart go bumpety-bump
I need you, baby, that's no lie
Without your love I will surely die

Hey, Mona
Ooh, Mona
Well, well-well-well, Mona
Hey, Mona

You might also like
Hey, hey, Mona
Oh, Mona

Can you come out on the front?
Listen to my heart go bumpety-bump
Need you, baby, that's no lie
Without your love I will surely dieEmbed
