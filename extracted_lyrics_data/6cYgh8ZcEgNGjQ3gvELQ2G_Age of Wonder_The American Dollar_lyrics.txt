How does the music get onto the gramophone, Ben?
You just sing into this horn.
Sing? What should I sing?
Sing anything!
I am singing here
In this gramophone
Like an idiot
Is how I feel
There! Now you can play it back on this machine!
That's all there is to it?
Yeah that's all!
Don't dawdle Morris, Grandma Tilly is waiting!
I am singing here
In this gramophone
Like an idiot
Is how I feel
Mama! That little boy, he was singing into that machine!
He's making a record
For my mother!
For your mother?
Yes, uh, she's uh, she's
Very sick
(sung)
She feels terrible
Terrible!
Lying all alone
So alone!
Crying cause her boy is gone!
I have to work
But on her gramophone
Yes she owns a gramophone!
She hears his voice
She loves my voice!
And in his voice she finds the...what?
The will, the courage
Yes! The courage to go on
and on and on and...
That sounds wonderful!
Doesn't it?
Truly wonderful!
Wasn't it?
How much did you say that it was?
25 dollars!
So much?
Yes, but think Missus of your Morris
Soon he'll be gone and grown
Gone off to work, or worse, a girl of his own!
Oh!
Think how the years are flying
{MORRIS' MOTHER]
Flying!
Fast like the birds above
Faster than the birds above
Don't just stand there sighing
Now you'll have joy undying
Think, Missus, what you're buying
Think, Missus, of that
One special sound
Here comes that sound
Hark to the sound!
Of love!
I am singing here
In this gramophone
Mama, I dedicate
This song to you!
To me? I'll take it!
Come...
See my magic music machine
Step right on over to your old buddy, Ben
I'm here to show how
American know-how
Means that you're never lonely again!
Gather round, you'll see what I mean
There's room for everyone, you don't have to shove!
And to proceed, folks
All that we need, folks
One volunteer
Ooh, here's one right here
To bring you "The Sound of Love"
(instrumental)
Here's my magic music machine
It ain't no blarney when I tell ya it's great!
Tis an old country tune
That I croon 'neath the moon
For my mama!
Anymore there?
For her mama!
O, cara Mama!
How I love you Mama!
You hear me singing
I love you Mama!
Mama, Mama, Mama, Mama, Mama, Mama, Mama, Mama, Mama, Mama, Mama, Mama, Mama, Mama - what a machine!
What a machine!
The newest wonder of a wonderful age!
Hey Mr. Edison!
Thanks for the medicine!
Grazie, Signora
Faith and Begorrah!
Stop with the hora!
Send your friends for a sample of...
The sound of love!Embed
