Seeing you walk by
Make a river twist and shout
Shakes the birds right from the sky
CHORUS
Caledonia, who could own ya
Spirit of romance
Caledonia, Caledonia, dance
Caledonia, Caledonia
Your simple little greed
Make an inch of a loser's wings
Make a fool right out of me
(chorus)
Caledonia, Caledonia
You make my senses fly
Give me reason to believe
And I don't wonder why
(chorus)
Caledonia, Caledonia
Inside of my soul
Caledonia, Caledonia
We'll move it slow
Caledonia, Caledonia
