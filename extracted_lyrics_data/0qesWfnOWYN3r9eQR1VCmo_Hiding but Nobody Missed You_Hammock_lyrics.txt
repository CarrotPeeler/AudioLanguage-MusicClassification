2 ContributorsHiding but Nobody Missed You LyricsHow could I forget your smile?
(Secrets hidden in your eyes)
It's hard to imagine you now
(Lost in your feelings)
I go back every once in a while
(Drifting under endless sky)
You're crying. You keep crying
You used to just sit and stare
(Seeing yourself so high)
Living - but you weren't really there
(You found no reason)
Then you vanished like the evening air
(Never even said goodbye)
You were dying, You were dying inside
And now all the nights fade away
Fade away like you
I'm watching the nights fade away
Fade away, just like youYou might also likeEmbed
