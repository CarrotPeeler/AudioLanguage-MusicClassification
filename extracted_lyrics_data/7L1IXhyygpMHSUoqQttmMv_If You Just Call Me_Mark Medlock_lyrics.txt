2 ContributorsIf You Just Call Me LyricsOh honey I know, love is an ocean
Oh baby I see, it's always in motion
You pull me up, and you drag me down
This love will make me crazy
You take my heart and you fool around
Your heart is shooting star
If you just call me, I'll be there
And if you need me, I take care
If you are crying, just call my name
Baby I miss you, again and again
Oh darling, don't take away your heart
Oh baby I know, you're telling story
So many lies, but I don't worry
I don't want to be alone
You're to me like heaven
And in my heart is just your home
You are my everythingYou might also likeEmbed
