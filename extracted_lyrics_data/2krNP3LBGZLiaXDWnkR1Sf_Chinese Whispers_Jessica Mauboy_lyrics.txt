3 ContributorsChinese Whispers Lyrics
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Whoo

Looking back to the third grade, nothing has changed
Sitting in the room in a small circle of bloom
Waiting for the secret to come
I hear the words, but the same to a different tune
Everybody's trying to bring in their point of view
No one knows just what we've begun

I know (I know)
You know (You know)
It's so predictable
The way it goes (The way)
It's driving me crazy

He says, she says
Everybody says, says
We say, they say
Everything is his say, his say
Like Chinese whispers
He says, she says
Everybody says, says
We say, they say
Everything is his say
This game of Chinese whispers
You might also like
Stuck in a world of worship and magazines
There's no messing with the minds of inspiring teens
I don't know, don't know where to turn
I need some inspiration with information to take home
'Cause all this trivial information is becoming old
Now's the time I'm breaking the mode

I know (I know)
You know (You know)
It's so predictable
The way it goes (The way)
It's driving me crazy

He says, she says
Everybody says, says
We say, they say
Everything is his say, his say
Ooh, like Chinese whispers
He says, she says
Everybody says, says
We say, they say
Everything is his say (Ooh, yeah)
This game of Chinese whispers
He says, she says
Everybody says, says
We say, they say
Everything is his say, his say
Like Chinese whispers
He says, she says
Everybody says, says
We say, they say
Everything is his say
This game of Chinese whispers

I know (I know)
You know (You know)
It's so predictable (It's so predictable)
The way it goes (The way)
It's driving me crazy
I know (I know)
You know (You know)
It's only ready for (Only ready for)
The way it goes
It's driving me crazy

He says, she says
We say, they say (Mm)
He say
He says, she says
Everybody says, says
We say, they say
Everything is his say, his say
Like Chinese whispers
He says, she says
Everybody says, says
We say, they say (Oh)
Everything is his say
This game of Chinese whispers (This game, yeah)

He says, she says
Everybody says, says
We say, they say
Everything is his say, his say
Ooh, like Chinese whispers
He says, she says
Everybody says, says
We say, they say
Everything is his say
This game, ooh, of Chinese whispers

He says, she says (Everything)
We say, they say (Everything is his say)
He say
Like Chinese whispers
He says, she says (Yeah)
We say, they say (Ooh)
This game of Chinese whispersEmbed
