Wade in the Water. My God's gonna trouble the water
If you hear tell of me dying, I don't want nobody to cry
All I want you to do for me is just to close my dying eyes
Wade in the Water, Wade in the Water, Children
Wade in the Water. My God's gonna trouble the water
In my ying hour, I don't want nobody to mourn
All I want you to do for me is just give that bell a tone
Wade in the Water, Wade in the Water, Children
Wade in the Water. My God's gonna trouble the water
When I'm getting lonely
Well, I'm gonna shake my mother's hand
I'm gonna tell her all about my troubles
While travelling through this land
Wade in the Water, Wade in the Water, Children
Wade in the Water. My God's gonna trouble the waterYou might also likeEmbed
