5 ContributorsI Wonâ€™t Hurt You Lyrics
I've lost all my pride
I've been to Paradise
And out the other side
With no one to guide me
Torn apart by a fiery will inside

I won't hurt you
I won't hurt you
I won't hurt you
I won't hurt you

An untouched diamond
That's golden and brilliant without illumination
You're mouth's a constellation
The stars are in your eyes
I'll take a spaceship and try and go and find you

I won't hurt you
I won't hurt you
I won't hurt you
I won't hurt you
You might also like

My pale blue star
My rainbow
How good it is to know you're like me
Strike me with your lightning
Bring me down and bury me without shoes

I won't hurt you
I won't hurt you
I won't hurt you
I won't hurt you
I won't hurt you
I won't hurt you
I won't hurt you
I won't hurt youEmbed
