In the night our lights go on
Hold my hand as we shine through town
If you knew me you know that
I'm always higher when you're around

O-oh, oh, we're always on the run
O-oh, we'll shine until we're gone

Lay us down in the grass, alone
Let the sky fall in our arms
Might be dreaming and if I'm dreaming
Let me sleep forever more

O-oh, oh, we're always on the run
O-oh, we'll shine until we're gone

In your dream, o-oh
In your dream, o-oh
Let me in
Let me in
Let me in (We were the ones who, we were the ones who were, here)
Let me in (We were the ones who, we were the ones who were, here)
Let me in (We were the ones who, we were the ones who were, here)
Let me in (We were the ones who, we were the ones who were, here)
Let me in
Let me in
Let me in
Let me inYou might also likeEmbed
