1 ContributorMy Dwarf Is Getting Tired Lyrics
A mobile home in Anaheim - it's double-wide, it's new, it's clean
A friendly town, I think it's time, it's what we need
We had a long run together, a life you can't compare
The world is changing and it's getting strange out there

Forty years of motel rooms, cigarettes, and magazines
From Spokane clear down to Bakersfield
You might have seen us on the highway so many times before
But my dwarf is getting tired, my fat man just won't travel anymore

Well skinny-looking farmers brought their families down looking for a fat time
We had to work all day just to make 'em spend one little thin dime
Like hot dog contests, man you could eat 'em, might raise a buck or two
Boxing matches, you couldn't beat 'em, that midget kangaroo was a little too fast for you

We came down here to say good by to an old-time friend of mine
He died inside his rubber suit out on the street of dreams
It was a hot July Sunday, he was working overtime
People like seeing Mickey walk by down in Anaheim

Dwarves and fat men just might do the very best they can
But they can't compare with Tomorrow Land it seems
We had some real Western times together, can't be like before
'Cause my dwarf is getting tired, my fat man just won't travel anymore
No, we won't be seen from Bakersfield clear up to Spokane anymoreYou might also likeEmbed
