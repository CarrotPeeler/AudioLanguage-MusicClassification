3 ContributorsThe Night That Never End Lyrics
One night when I was sleeping
A gypsy woman sneak into my head
And she said
‘I've got a bottle of schnapps
Lets get to know each other drinking
A belly full of laughs
And some thoughts that beyond thinking
Let's play a game of those cards my friend
Because tonight I'm going to show you
How the night it never never never end

Morning is one thousand dreams away
And our expedition
Telling us to stay
So stay we will we've got that gypsy lady
Perched upon our bow
And the empire ship be heading
Where the wild ones they are now
Oh how the gods look down
And frown at those who never stood and said
‘My name is no-one'
And went a little mad (and went a little mad)

And from time to time
She sneaks back inside me and she say
‘lucky sing the secrets that I taught you always'
Replied ‘as long as I am living, I never forget'
That the sun is never rising and it never set
So let's make some fire and smoke and then
We'll go exploring in the night
That never never never end
You might also like
Morning is one thousand dreams away
And our expedition
Telling us to stay
So stay we will we've got that gypsy lady
Perched upon our bow
And the empire ship be heading
Where the wild ones they are now
Oh how the gods look down
And frown at those who never stood and said
‘My name is no-one'
And went a little mad (and went a little mad)

I've got a tingle in my back
And something sparking in my toes
I get the shivers through my body
When that trumpet blows
And while asleep I am awake
And while awake I am dreaming
Before I start to think I am scheming
(To start a party tonight my friends)
Because the woman, in my head
She said tonight, it's never, never, gonna end

I went to my friends
'Cause I found a fine beat
Oh, I like to play a rhythm
Where the rhythm plays me
Play it all day on a balcony above the street
Where ol' Frankie and me, we shuffle with our feet
When old man Georgie takes the sugar with his tea
When he's stirred by a melody of hands movin' easy
See it reminds him of dreams by the sea
Where the breeze blows underneath that island tree
So we played 'til the playing gave us the munchies
Then we played in the kitchen, made the easy gods happy
'Cause we left them a little chili special
And some chocolate we eat because its sweet (sweet!)
When I leave I am smilin' at the things I haven't done
I haven't broke a sweat, and I haven't had to run
For the list of one thousand and one that does plague me
Some days where the sun rays don't come, singin'
Parking inspector
Just made my list of one thousand, one thousand and one
But ah parking inspector, won't let you wreck my fun
When I get to my car, I am faced with a sight
That is strange, and it's sad, and it's mad, it's not right
It's one thousand and one spaces free but I see
That he fined me guilty of a time over fee
Now I know why my mother, why my mother warned me
Said you might be lucky, but know nothing comes for free
She's right, entirely
'Cause the ticket payed the song that I'll sing to this beat
Oh, parking inspector
Just made my list of one thousand, one thousand and one
But ah parking inspector, won't let you wreck my fun
'Cause when I pay for my ticket I won't curse and despise
No I run into the girl with the slinky blue eyes
And my list of one thousand and one will remain
Had plans to get it done but now my plans, they have changed, oh
(Parking inspector)
Parking inspector
Parking inspector
Just made my list of one thousand grow a little more
But ah parking inspector, you won't believe what I saw!
Oh, on the back of the ticket with invisible type
Was a map to the place with one thousand delights
And a key that was one to that spot by the sea
Where the breeze blows underneath that island treeEmbed
