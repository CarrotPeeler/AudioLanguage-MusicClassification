Street life, street life
Street life, street life
Street life, street life
Street life


Street life, street life
Street life, street life
Street life, street life
Street life

I play the street life
Because there's no place I can go
Street life
It's the only life I know
Street life
There's a thousand cards to play
Street life
Until you play your life away

You might also like
I play the street life
You can run away from time
Street life
For a nickel or a dime
Street life
But you better not get old
Street life
Or you're gonna feel the cold

Street life, street life
Street life, street life
Street life, street life
Street life


Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, street life, street life
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, street life, street life


Street life, street life
Street life, street life
Street life, street life
Street life
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, street life, street life
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, street life, street life
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, street life, street life
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, street life, street lifeEmbed
