1 ContributorThe Butcher’s Apron LyricsAlone in the corridor, he’s hot on your tracks
The butcher is slaughterous and ready to attack
An apron of leather adorns the cruel wretch
Menacing the night, blood on knife’s edge
A vision of terror is stalking the streets
Until he is caught, the city will bleed
The butcher’s apron bears the blood of his prey
In darkness he waits
Take flight from the knave
It’s your blood he craves
Like a fog, he creeps behind
A snake amongst mankind
Turn your back and run
From the butcher’s apron
Shrouded from the sun
By the butcher’s apron
An offering of blood
To the butcher’s apron
The sacrifice is done
For the butcher’s apron
Perverted and twisted, he violates the dead
Guided by the voice of God in his head
Reprehensible ripper, impotent and weak
Wielding a hammer, he’ll take what he seeks
Premeditated horrors, the cleaving of the flesh
The butcher brings fear, sorrow, and death
This reign of terror must come to a stop
The fiend must be caught
You might also likeTurn your back and run
From the butcher’s apron
Shrouded from the sun
By the butcher’s apron
An offering of blood
To the butcher’s apron
The sacrifice is done
For the butcher’s apronEmbed
