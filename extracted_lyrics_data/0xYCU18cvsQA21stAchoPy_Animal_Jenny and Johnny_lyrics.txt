We must modernize Jerusalem
Detonate the temples
Let 'em fight over the dust
We will organize in Bethlehem
Able-bodied women
And agnostic headstrong men
All will meet at 10

If you lose your fear of God
You are an animal at heart

Show your teeth to everyone
Don't let no one prove you wrong
You are an animal, an animal, an animal
Show your teeth to everyone
Don't let no one prove you wrong
You are an animal, an animal, an animal

We must rearrange reality
Shuffle all the cards
Play the joker with the queen
Just to make her scream
To destroy all our enemies
Must investigate our friends
Find the ones who don't believe
Hang 'em from the trees
You might also like
If you lose your fear of God
You are an animal at heart

Show your teeth to everyone
Don't let no one prove you wrong
You are an animal, an animal, an animal
Show your teeth to everyone
Don't let no one prove you wrong
You are an animal, an animal, an animal
Show your teeth to everyone
Don't let no one prove you wrong
You are an animal, an animal, an animalEmbed
