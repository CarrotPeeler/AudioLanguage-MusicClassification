1 ContributorAncient Skies LyricsWords and music by Michael Gungor and Michael Rossback
You have never changed
Your love is endless and Your mercy has remained
Through all the ages You shine so bright
Nothing can compare
You made the heavens and Your glory fills the air
Through all of the ages You ride the ancient skies
And You ride the ancient skies
You're amazing
Creation cries
So will I
You have never changed
Your love is endless and your mercy has remained
Through all the ages You shine so bright
Nothing can compare
You made the heavens and Your glory fills the air
Through all the ages You ride the ancient skies
And you ride the ancient skies
You're amazing
Creation cries
So will I
You're amazing
Now we stand amazed
And now we'll sing the word
They sang in ancient days
A single word that's overflowing
Endless praise: Hallelujah
