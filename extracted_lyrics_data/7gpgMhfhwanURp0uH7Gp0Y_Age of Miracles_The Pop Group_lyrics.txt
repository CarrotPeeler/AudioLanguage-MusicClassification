1 ContributorAge of Miracles LyricsSometimes I stumble
Sometimes I fall
Can they not see the signs
Can they not hear the call
Please can someone tell me
Is this the land of the lost
Please can someone tell me
Are we the fallen gods
This is the age
This is the age of miracles
And as I climb
Superstition mountain
And as I reach
‘Hallelujah bay’
Please can someone tell me
Is this the land of the lost
Please can someone tell me
Are we the fallen gods
This is the age
This is the age of miracles

Can they not see the signs
Can they not hear the call
This is the age
This is the age of miracles
This is the age
This is the age of miraclesEmbed
