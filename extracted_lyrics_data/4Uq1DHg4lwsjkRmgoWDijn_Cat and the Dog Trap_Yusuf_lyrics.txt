2 ContributorsCat & the Dog Trap LyricsCat's in the yard
Fancy free
Dog barges 'round, says
"You can't catch me!
No siree"
There was a time
When I was younger
I'd chase the tail
Of any danger
About to learn
About to learn
Cat jumps a fence
Lands in a pram
Baby screams, "Mama!"
Out runs the man
Cat gets the can
There was a time
When I was bolder
I'd chase the heels
Of any stranger
About to learn
About to learn

Chained to a stone
Empty Bowl by his side
Just an old fish bone
Dreams of home
There was a time
A long way back
When I would fall
For any dog trap
About to learn
About to learn
About to learn
