6 ContributorsKi LyricsDays alone, never felt like this
The lights of home, a year away
And it's too late to fight it all, just drive
And the streets...glow...and the night...
The night is soft
Soft
And it's all inviting
As anyone could ever know
And this warm collective we endure...
We endure and pass the moment
We endure and pass the moon
We endure and pass the moment
We endure
We endure and pass the moment
We endure and pass the moon
We endure and pass the moment
We endure
We endure and pass the moment
We endure and pass the moon
We endure and pass the moment
We endure

Here's a little riddle 'bout a when I was a little toddle
Piddle in the puddle and my head was in a muddle
You can sing it when you're sad
You can sing it when you're mad
You can sing it in the shower
Come along the latest fad
Gaia to gaia to gaia to gaia to gaia to gaia to gaia to gaia to gaia to gaia to gaia to gaia to gaia to gaia to gaia to gaia to gaia to gaia to gaia to gaia

If you feel like you are incomplete
Yet you are still in love
Yet you are sleeping eternal

So we fall on warm silence
I know, yes I know, it all goes away
So we fall on warm silence
I know, yes I know, it all goes away!Embed
