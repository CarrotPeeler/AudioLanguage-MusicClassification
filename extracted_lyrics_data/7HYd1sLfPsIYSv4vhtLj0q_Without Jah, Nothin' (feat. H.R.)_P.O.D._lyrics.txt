7 ContributorsWithout Jah, Nothinâ€™ Lyrics
One, two, three, four!

Without Jah, Jah, what you say
What you say is nothing
Without Jah you wanna say
So say something
Without Jah, nothing to nothing
Cause everybody says
Yeah everybody says
It's just something
With Jah, Jah, I live off, I live off
Of Jah, Jah
With everybody's sayin something
Something with Jah
Nothing without Jah
Without Jah, without Jah
Nothing, nothing

Without Jah, nothing
Nothing
Without Jah, no nothing
Nothing
Without Jah, nothing
You might also like
With everything you need and more
Let everything living love the Lord
With Jah, something, something
Without Jah, oh, he is nothing, nothing

Without Jah, nothing
Nothing
Without Jah, no nothing
Nothing
Without Jah, nothing

La la la la lo, we sing
Don't you know it's about the crazy human rights?
So sing along but party
What we say, each and everyday day
That Jah will lead the way

'Cause
Without Jah you ain't nothing
Without Jah nothing
And without Jah nothing
And with Jah everything
With Jah you're something
Now we got something
Now we got something
My people have shown
My Jah is something
My people have shown about
With something
Those people that love
Them, them is something
'Cause they know that
Without Jah, nothing
Whenever Jah loves
You don't know it's anything
'Cause
With Jah you know
You're everything
So crazy human rights
Compadre is everything
P.O.D. is gonna lead we on the way
For eternity
P.O.D. is gonna lead the way
Without questionality in the unity
Black and white behind them
We living for humanity

Without Jah, nothing
Without Jah, nothing
And with Jah, everything

Hey, wanna love, wanna love
Wanna love, wanna love
Wanna love, wanna love
Wanna love, wanna love
Wanna love, wanna love
One love, a one love
I'll show to people, one love
Black and white people are one love
Jah love, Jah love, Jah love, yeah yeah yeah
Without Jah you're nothing
Without Jah you're nothing
Without Jah you're nothing
And with Jah you're everything
And with a Jah something
And with a Jah something
Jesus loves you
Jesus Christ loves you
Jesus Christ loves you
Jesus Christ He'll love youEmbed
