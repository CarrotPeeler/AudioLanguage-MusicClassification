1 ContributorThe Warmth Of Silence LyricsThe scene arranged
She carefully placed each
As if she could climb
From inside the screen
An angle closely opening
Now and then
The movie of the mind
Shows an end
The memory phase
Reminding other days
Now and then
The movie of the mind
Chose an end
When torn and formed
As you speak nothing
Now and then
The movie of the mind
Shows an end
Deep in conversation
A slip in memory
Life revolves around
And to see the places
Eyes, eyes have seen
Then to turn
To the warmth of silence
Now and then
The movie of the mind
Shows an end
The memory phase
Reminding other days
Now and then...
When torn and formed
As you speak nothing
Now and then...
Deep in conversation
A slip in memory
Life revolves around
And to see the places
Eyes, eyes have seen
Then to turn
To the warmth of silence
As if she could climb
From inside the screen
Life (what eyes seen)
Revolves (from your calling)
Around (to bring back in)
And to see the places (like an ocean)
Eyes, (what eyes seen)
Eyes have seen (from your calling)
Then to turn (to bring back in)
To the warmth of silence (like an ocean)You might also likeEmbed
