4 ContributorsBoy, Oh Boys Lyrics
Ouh les Garçons
Bienvenue à Paris

Boys, boys, boys
How I love you boys
Green eyed, brown eyed, blue eyed boys
Boys boys boys
I like all kinds of boys
Hey big spender, buy me toys
(Bienvenue à Paris)

You can take me to Rodeo
Send me presents in the mail
I need more things, more diamond rings from Tiffany's
(Ouh les Garçons)
You can do my laundry naked
You can bake my birthday cake
I need more boys to mop the floors and man the gates

1-2-3
I'll tell ya how it's gonna be
You've got to keep me satisfied
Don't complain
You've got a lot of work to do
It's not just good enough to say you tried
You might also like
Oh Boy, Oh Boys
Oh Boy, Oh Boys

Boys, boys, boys
How I love those boys
Always making messes
Always making noise
(Bienvenue à Paris)
Boy oh boys
Well, yes I am the boss
You'll pay the new girl tax, read my lipgloss

Fly me on your jet to Rome
Talk 'til morning on the phone
Tell me secrets, tell me lies, your desires
When I fall in love with you
I will know your love is true
If I can look you in the eye and trust in you
(Ouh les Garçons)

1-2-3
I'll tell ya how it's gonna be
You've got to keep me satisfied
Don't complain
You've got a lot of work to do
It's not good enough to say you tried
Oh Boy, Oh Boys
Oh Boy, Oh Boys

(Bienvenue à Paris)
To all my boys in blue collars
Got to be loyal
To all my boys, all my 'ballers
I should be spoiled
To all my boys on the dance floor
Your moves are flawless just like me

1-2-3
I'll tell ya how it's gonna be
You've got to keep me satisfied
Don't complain
You've got a lot of work to do
It's not good enough to say you tried

Oh Boy, Oh Boys
Oh Boy, Oh Boys

(Bienvenue à Paris)
To all my boys in New York City
I don't come cheaply
To all the boys who think I'm pretty
I'm not so easy
To all my boys in Hollywood
You're never gonna get to meEmbed
