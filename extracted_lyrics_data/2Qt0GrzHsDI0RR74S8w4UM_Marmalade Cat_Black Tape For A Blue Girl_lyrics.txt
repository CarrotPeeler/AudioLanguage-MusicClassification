3 ContributorsMarmalade Cat LyricsI live in a house on Benefit Street
I prowl here within the walls
Peekin' out from behind my paws
My second skin is a marmalade cat
I feel at home as a marmalade cat
I'm big and fat, an old lazy boy. I'm sleepin' in the sun
So, why do they fear what makes me feel at home?
I'm up in the loft, I play in the sheets, he pushes me down
He pets my head. He runs his hands through my fur
I smile with a purr on my lips. It's not just about the
Bowls of cream - he pets my lustrous fur
My second skin is a marmalade cat
When I'm back in the world my feline power fades
Give me my big fat coat of marmalade fur and long whiskers to match
I'll be home catching mice instead of catching flackYou might also likeEmbed
