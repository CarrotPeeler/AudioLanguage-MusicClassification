1 ContributorNo Ordinary Thing Lyrics
Was this to show you I would not fail you?
Was that the reason you were looking back?
So I'm trusting in existence
I'm thrusting on momentum
I don't wanna see these threads of love collide
Not ever again
No, not ever again
No

I know it's not working
Knowledge will capture comfort one day
Our worlds will be worth more than living once in this lifetime
We could liberate today
We could alleviate tomorrow
But no one can reach the light switch
No one can reach the light switch, they say
No, that's what they say
No

My love
This is no ordinary thing, my love
My love, my love
This is no ordinary thing
No, it's just no ordinary thing
You might also like
I'm naked, I'm naked in this afterlife
I was falling, I was falling from the greatest highs
If everything, if everything should come to pass
Tell me, when are you coming home to stay?
When are you coming home to stay?
Again to stay
Again

'Cause, my love
This is no ordinary thing, my love
My love, my love
This is no ordinary thing, no
No ordinary thing

We were compromised by our own hearts
Jealous seas couldn't keep us apart
I wanted to touch you
But we stop when we start
I wanted to hold you, hold you
But here we are
Here we are

This is no ordinary thing, my love
No ordinary thing, my love
No ordinary thing, my love
No ordinary thing, my love
My love, my love
This is no ordinary thing, my love
My love, my love
This is no ordinary thing
No, this was no ordinary thingEmbed
