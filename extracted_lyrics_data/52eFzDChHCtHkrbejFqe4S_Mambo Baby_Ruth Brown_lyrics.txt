All my baby wants to do is the mambo
Morning, noon and night time too
It's the mambo
He goes mambo rhythms, effects all the time
He goes mambo rhythms, effects all the time
'Cause that mambo rhythm feels so fine
He's neglecting our romance
For the mambo
He's neglecting our romance
For the mambo
He just loves that crazy dance
Called the mambo
Mambo baby, mambo baby
Oh, mambo baby I love you so
But me or that mambo has got to go
The only thing he's thinking of
Is the mambo
When we should be making love
It's the mambo
But me or that mambo has got to goYou might also likeEmbed
