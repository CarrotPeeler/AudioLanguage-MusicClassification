3 ContributorsTo Be Loved Lyrics
Someone to care
Someone to share
Lonely hours
And moments of despair

To be loved (To be loved), to be loved (To be loved)
Oh, what a feeling
To be loved

Someone to kiss
Someone to miss
When you're away
To hear from each day

To be loved (To be loved), to be loved (To be loved)
Oh, what a feeling
To be loved

Some wish to be a king or a queen
Some wish for fortune and fame
But to be truly, truly, truly loved
Is more than all of these things, oh, oh
You might also like
Someone to kiss
Someone to miss
When you're away
To hear from each day

To be loved (To be loved), to be loved (To be loved)
Oh, what a feeling
To be loved
Woo


(To be loved, to be loved, ooh)
Some wish to be a king or a queen
Some wish for fortune and fame
But to be truly, truly, truly loved
Is more than all of these things, hey

Someone to kiss
Someone to miss
When you're away
To hear from each day
To be loved (To be loved), to be loved (To be loved)
Oh, what a feeling
To be loved

To be loved (To be loved), to be loved (To be loved)
Oh, what a feeling
What a feeling, ooh, to be loved
To be lovedEmbed
