4 ContributorsWhen a Man Loves a Woman LyricsWhen a man loves a woman, can't keep his mind on nothing else
He'd change the world for the good things he's found
If she is bad, he can't see it, she can do no wrong
Turn his back on his best friend if he put her down
When a man loves a woman, spend his very last dime
Trying to hold on to what he needs
He'd give up all of his comforts and sleep out in the rain
If she says that's the way it ought to be
Well this man loves you, woman
Give you everything I can
Trying to hold on to your high class love
Baby, please don't treat me bad
When a man loves a woman, deep down in his soul
She can bring him such misery
If she plays him for a fool, he's the last one to know
Loving eyes can never see
When a man loves a woman, she can do no wrong
She can never look another man
When a man loves a woman, hey hey I know exactly how he feels
'cause baby baby you are my girl
