Uh-huh
Yeah
Uh
Yeah
I painted the skies red
Until the raindrops bled
Now heaven whispers words I never said
Born and bred on banku and bread
Take a leap of faith and watch my wings spread
Bachelor's pad, empty pizza boxes
Counts my blessings, discounts my losses
Monkey off my back, hold my horses
My heart rate's higher than the rate of divorces
 by the parking meter
It's out of order
Leaving my quarters
 they treat me like teenager
Their pressure, the pressure 
 I'll be just, journey just come for 
 before me and wife he drop down
But wife he no longer around
So so I holler for a dollar, some pounds
Cedi, some naira, franco throwing francs
Give money, some sweaters, a cause to be frank
I didn't need speak but my tongue make empty
I didn't need vision Mr. 20/20
Chale, problems chao cho plenty plenty
 say make I pray, just maybe
But lately I just 
My kiddy there grow, 
My ego bruise, but I refuse to lose
My alarm too loud so I hit the snooze
Case of the blues and it's not even Monday
It's high stakes, the heartbreak, this foreplay
 the snowflakes and cornflakes
 a cook trying to walk straight
Now everybody want 
 two women with behind
Cancerous time but it might be benign
See, I'm  even if you blind
No 
Now everybody want 
 two women with behind
Cancerous time but it might be benignYou might also likeEmbed
