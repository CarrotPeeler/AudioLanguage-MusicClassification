3 Contributors99 Pounds Lyrics25 lbs. of pure cane sugar
In each and every kiss
You wouldn't know what I'm talking about
If you never had lovin' like this
I don't mean to be brash
Just know it's a natural fact
Good things come in small packages
You'll have to agree to that
99 lbs. of natural born goodness yo
99 lbs. of soul
Now I'm 99 lbs. of natural goodness yo
99 lbs. of soul
25 lbs. of tenderness in each and every touch
25 lbs. of understanding my man
And I don't want me to worry too much
24 lbs of something else that I can't even name
And it all adds up to 99 lbs
All put together in a fine brown frame
And I'm 99 lbs of natural born goodness
99 lbs of soul
Let me tell you now
I'm 99 lbs of natural born goodnessYou might also likeEmbed
