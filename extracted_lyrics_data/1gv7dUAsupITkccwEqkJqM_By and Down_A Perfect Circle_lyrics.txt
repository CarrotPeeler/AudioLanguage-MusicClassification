5 ContributorsBy and Down LyricsMoving in and out of the shadow
It's no easy mission, holding on to how I picture you
Showing only bits and pieces
'Til the tide betrays you and your empty allocution
Searching your eyes for a hint or a trace of humility
Searching your eyes for the saint is an act of futility
Searching your eyes for a hint or trace of it
Searching your eyes for humility
Searching your eyes for a hint or a trace
I'm still searching, searching
Showing all the missing pieces
'Til the light betrays you and your empty allocution
Saw the Piper by and down the river
Caught his crippled alchemy from pounding waves of adoration
Pied Piper, float on down the river
Bloated carcass crippled me, the weight of adoration
Moving in and out of the shadows
It's no easy mission, holding on to how I picture youYou might also like9Embed
