7 ContributorsBrokenhearted (Soulpower Duet Mix) Lyrics
Only brokenhearted
Life's not over
I can start again
While I'm lonely, brokenhearted
It's a hurtin' thing to get over

I'm young but I'm wise enough to know
That you don't fall in love overnight
That's why I thought if I took my time
That everything in love would be right, oh-oh

But as soon as I closed my eyes
I was sayin' to love, "Goodbye"

(But I guess I'm) only brokenhearted
Life's not over
I can start again
While I'm lonely, brokenhearted
It's a hurtin' thing to get over

No more empty conversation
Next time I will be totally sure, oh
Don't want the pain of fallin' in and out of love
It's more than my poor heart should know
You might also like
So I'll listen to all advice
And remember each time I cry

(That I guess I'm) only brokenhearted
Life's not over
I can start again
While I'm lonely, brokenhearted
It's a hurtin' thing to get over
Only brokenhearted
Life's not over
I can start again
While I'm lonely, brokenhearted
It's a hurtin' thing to get over


So, I'll listen to all advice
And remember each time I cry, I'm

Only brokenhearted
Life's not over
I can start again
While I'm lonely, brokenhearted
It's a hurtin' thing to get over
Never thought I'd be alone again
That's why I asked you to be my best friend
Oh, you know you're always on my mind
I think about you all the time
I'm only brokenhearted
It's a hurtin' thing to get over
Only brokenhearted
Life's not over
I can start again...Embed
