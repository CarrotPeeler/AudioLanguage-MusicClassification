2 ContributorsPecking Order Lyrics
Finally got the picture, losing his job
Middle-aged nothing, a narrow-minded slob
Being used for love from the back of his hand
Females for mischief present someone bad
She comes upstairs to slap around the kids
 on the skids

 to think about, just do it with a smile
 treats her like a child
Power meets control, the story's been told
They wanna keep you down, keep you in the hole
Take it from the Luddites, storm over weak
, like the mean over meek
Men over women, white over black
Rich over poor like the money that they lack

Power meets control, the story's been told
They wanna keep you down, keep you in the hole
Take it from the Luddites, storm over weak
, like the mean over meek
Man over woman, white over black
Rich over poor for the money that they lack
Everything lies, keep the  down
 the oldest game in town
You might also like
Take it from the Luddites, storm over weak
 like the mean over meek
Man over woman, white over black
It's the pecking orderEmbed
