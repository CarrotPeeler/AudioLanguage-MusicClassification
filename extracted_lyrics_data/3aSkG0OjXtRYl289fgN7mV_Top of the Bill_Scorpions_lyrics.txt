3 ContributorsTop of the Bill Lyrics
You're a rock and roll star
You're out of the charts
Your blood is cold, you're getting old
But your life is rock and roll
That crazy rock and roll band
Is spinning in your head (In your head)
Each and every way you make the thoughts
Is about stars on the chart

Oh, oh
And they are top of the bill

You're a rock and roll star
You've been the first one on the chart
You've had glory and fame
Rock and roll was your game

Oh, oh
Ah, and you were top of the billSee Scorpions LiveGet tickets as low as $61You might also likeEmbed
