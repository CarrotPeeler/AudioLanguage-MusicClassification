5 ContributorsPowerful Stuff LyricsShe walks down the street a-knockin' 'em dead
Store window dummies even turn their heads
Sho' 'nuff, powerful stuff
When I saw her I burned my black book
Made a blind man take a second look
Sho' 'nuff I think I'm in love and thats Powerful Stuff
Naugahide skirt, black stacked heels
Red copper hair, dig the wig it's unreal
Sho' 'nuff, powerful stuff
Ole man Atlas holding up the world
He'd drop everything for that girl
Sho' 'nuff. I think I'm in love and it's Powerful Stuff
Her hip shakin' whip snakin' cooked my goose
I tell you that babe shes a fine papoose
I love her mind, but here's the deal
She's got the kind of girl who rides the manmobile
She opens her eyes and turns on the juice
Pullin' like a magnet and she don't turn loose
Sho' 'nuff, powerful stuff
When she starts rockin'
Dont touch that dial
She's a hundred-mega-kilowatt
Woman child
Sho' 'nuff I think I'm in love
Think I'm in love-I think im in love
And that's powerful stuffYou might also likeEmbed
