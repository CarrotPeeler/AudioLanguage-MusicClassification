I'd like to teach the world to sing
And put an end to suffering if I could
With the dedicated heart and soul
Of Britains greatest rock 'n' roll robin hood
But youre eyes are dim you cannot see
Your middle name is misery
Do you like to teach the world to sing
You're gonna get your head kicked in
Don't lose your temper shopping centre son
Just remember young offenders mum
All gods children snatch a handbag
Spot the ball and mash the grandad
Choose the pictures on the news
Count the stitches on the bruise
Lock your sons uo with your daughters
Stay at home dont drink the water
Intercept or interfere and just blame the parents
Don't lose your temper shopping centre son
Just remember young offenders mum
Down the front of the church
For the second time in life loves hurts
This time theres no buttons and bows
Shes wearing non fast-coloured clothes
Service seems to last for hours
No-one wants to catch the flowers
On the shoulder of an older brother
The young offenders mother
