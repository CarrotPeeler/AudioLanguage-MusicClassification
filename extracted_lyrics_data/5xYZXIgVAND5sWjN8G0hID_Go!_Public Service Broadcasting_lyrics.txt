12 ContributorsGo! Lyrics
This is Apollo Control at 102 hours into the flight of Apollo 11
It's grown quite quiet here in Mission Control
A few moments ago flight director Gene Kranz requested that everyone sit down
Get prepared for events that are coming
And he closed with a remark of good luck to all of you
]
12 minutes now until ignition for powered descent
Everything's still looking very good at this point
Okay, all flight controllers go-no-go for powered descent

Retro? Go
FIDO? Go
Guidance? Go

GNC? Go
EECOM? Go
Surgeon? Go

CAPCOM we're go for powered descent
We're off to a good start, play it cool
