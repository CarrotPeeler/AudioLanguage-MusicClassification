Dreams in class
Answers the question before it's asked
You can see johnny but he's not here
Nobody saw johnny disappear
Mama says his mother's too easy
Letting him come and go as he pleases
Walls and windows won't do it
Lock the door
Johnny goes right through it
It's so hard to get his attention
When he's out there in another dimension
Johnny I wanna follow you outside
I wanna feel that high
It's so hard to get his attention
When he's out there in another dimension
Johnny, I wanna follow you outside
I wanna feel that high
Johnny, you, I can pretend with
You are the only one I can really bend with
For what is broken there's no fix
You fill my eyes with fire tricks
Anything you got up your sleeve
Anything you tell me, johnny, I'll believe

When you're out there in another dimension
Johnny, I wanna follow you outside
I wanna feel that highEmbed
