Beautiful girl
You must've been a beautiful baby too
Beautiful woman
You must've had your moments inside the sun
Beautiful girl
Beautiful stranger
Why do you have to walk with your head hung low?
Beautiful girl
Your eyes are mockingbirds inside a gilded cage
Your life's a silent movie that I haven't even heard for ages
Tell me everything, someone's gotta hear this
Beautiful thing
Beautiful mother, frozen in ice
I've waited for you to grow up for my whole life
Beautiful girl
Your eyes are mockingbirds inside a gilded cage
Your life's a silent movie that I haven't even heard for ages
Tell me everything, someone's gotta hear this
Beautiful thing
