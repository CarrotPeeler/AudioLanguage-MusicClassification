2 Contributors15 Minutes Older LyricsWaking up
Everything is changing cause today
Is your day, that's what they say
Soon you'll be writing history
Right on TV
You know it's now or never
Strike a pose, there you go
Down-the-line, before you know
You're doing what they told you
Lights go off, but lifes go on
You're out before it's begun
The hands upon your shoulder
Suddenly grow colder
And you're 15 minutes older
Waking up
Realizing nothing's left to do
Sure they found another you
And soon he'll be writing history
On your TV
You know it's now and never
Strike a pose, there you go
Down-the-line, before you know
You're doing what they told you
Lights go off, but lifes go on
You're out before it's begun
The hands upon your shoulder
Suddenly grow colder
And you're 15 minutes older, 15 minutes older
15 mintues older, 15 minutes older

So beware when it comes to now or never
Waking up
Everything is changing cause today
Is your day, that's what they say
Strike a pose, there you go
Down-the-line, before you know
You're doing what they told you
Lights go off, but lifes go on
You're out before it's begun
The hands upon your shoulder
Suddenly grow colder
And you're 15 minutes olderEmbed
