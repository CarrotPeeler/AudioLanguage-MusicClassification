1 ContributorAre You A Ghost? LyricsIts two in the mornin
I'll tell you why I'm awake
There it goes, that creepy feeling again
Round in my head
Ohhh again, here in my head
Here in the darkness
There's so many shapes
Shadows burn like faded flames
And die into the night
Ohhhh and fly up so high
Oh
Are you a ghost, or are you alive?
Would you be here for me
Be here for me now?
Imagination, or are you for real?
Just give me a sign....and I'll know
Cool wind is blowin
Fingers through hair
Standing in an empty room
Alone it feels like you're there
Oh, alone I know that you're there

Would you be here for me
Be here for me now?
Imagination, or are you for real?
Just give me a sign
I'll tell you what I know
I'll tell you how I feel
Are you a ghost, or are you alive?
Would you be here for me
Be here for me now?
Imagination, or are you for real?
Just give me a sign......and I'll know
Are you a ghost, or are you alive?
Whould you be here for me
Be here for me now?
Imagination, or are you for real?
Just give me a signEmbed
