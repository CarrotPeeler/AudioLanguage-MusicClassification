5 ContributorsSomebody Help Me LyricsSomebody help me, yeah
Somebody help me now
Won't somebody tell me
What I've done wrong
When I was just a little boy of seventeen
I had a girl, she was my queen
She didn't love me like I loved her, now I know
Now I'm so lonesome on my own
Somebody help me, yeah
Somebody help me now
Won't somebody tell me
What I've done wrong
I need someone in my life
I need a girl to hold me tight
Someone who can make me feel
Make me feel all right
Somebody help me, yeah
Somebody help me now
Won't somebody tell me
What I've done wrong
Somebody help me, yeah
Somebody help me now
Somebody help me, yeah (right now, won't ya)
Somebody help me now (somebody help me)
Somebody help me, yeah (somebody help me now)
