1 ContributorCollective Suicide (Club Mix) LyricsThere's no place in this fucking world
No place for a fragile heart like mine
I can't hide my insecurity
When madness comes around
I will wake you up at night
Prepare for collective suicide
I can take you to the moon
Salvation will come soon
And I am not afraid to die
As long as there will be you and I
I will wake you up at night
Prepare for collective suicide
You always try to force me
In the wrong direction
Tell me how can you be sure
As long as I feel insecureYou might also likeEmbed
