Spitting out the demons (Demons)
Popping out of holes (Good times)
Spitting out the demons (Demons)
Pumping in the good times (Good times)
(Devil, he won't have me)
Spitting out the demons (Demons)
Falling out of aeroplanes (Good times)
Spitting out the demons (Demons)
Devil, he won't have me (Good times)

Devil, he won't have me (Good times)
Devil, he won't have me (Good times)
Devil, he won't have me (Good times)
Devil, he won't have me (Good times)
