Oh, baby all that I want is for you to hold me
Kiss me and tell me that you'll stay the night
Oh, baby all...
Oh, baby all...

Lonely, feeling lonely, feeling blue
And though you're near me
I'm longing so for you
Trying, trying hard to see the sun
But worse than lonesome
Is lonesome when you're two

I can see your pain and sorrow
Please have faith in our tomorrow

All that I want is for you to hold me
Kiss me and tell me that you'll stay the night
Oh, baby all that I want is that when you've told me
Kiss me again and I'll be alright
Oh, baby all...

Darkness, it's so dark around us now
Hanging on to a promise
And a vow
Waiting, I don't mind waiting for a while
If you'll just hold me
And tell me when and how
You might also like
Please be strong I know it hurts you
Love you so I won't desert you

All that I want is for you to hold me
Kiss me and tell me that you'll stay the night
Oh, baby all that I want is that when you've told me
Kiss me again and I'll be alright
Oh, baby all...
Oh, baby all...
Oh, baby all...Embed
