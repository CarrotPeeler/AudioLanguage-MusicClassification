3 ContributorsPerception Twin LyricsPush me over the edgesâ€¦
Suffocating the senses
You strip me defenseless, I know you
Images reflected
I'm raped and molested, touched by you
Perception over reality
What we see is not always what we see
Deeper inside
You'll find your eyes lie, judge not this time
Alone
Distorted dreams in the silence
No vital signs, just the violence
Tortured frame in the empty
Scars on my body just ghosts to remind me
I burn
Still reflection disturbs you
Twin perception unnerves you
Split in two
Beautiful brutality
Self-inflicted, these cuts my company
Opposite sides of this coin
Try both sides
I'm yours you're mine
You might also likeAlone
You scream like a symphony
Wicked trick has left me in agony
Your malfunction is needing
Vertical scars are proof of the bleeding
You burn
Your twin, with you
Within the burning
I am your twin
With you, within aloneEmbed
