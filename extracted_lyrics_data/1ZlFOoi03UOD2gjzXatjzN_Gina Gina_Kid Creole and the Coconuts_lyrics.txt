3 ContributorsGina, Gina Lyrics
Gina, Gina
He's just a ski instructor
Gina, Gina
He’s just a ski instructor

What can he do for you that we couldn't do?
He'll spend his whole life through snowballing you
Ooooh
Ooooh oooh oooh ooooh

Gina, Gina
He’s just a ski instructor
Gina, Gina, oh
He's just a ski instructor

What do you do when all the snow starts to melt?
There's been no action here since William Tell
Ooooh
Blow saxophone
It's all about Gina, Gina
Gina, Gina
You might also like
What will you say to him when you'd rather sleep?
You think saleevi gotz is all that you need?
No

He'll take you up a slope and down one too
Showing off his value
Wienerschnitzel and fondues
Is all he will allow you
Isn't that annoying?
Isn't that boring?
Ohhhh

Gina, Gina
(It’s all about Gina)
He’s just a ski instructor
Gina, Gina
(It's all about Gina)
He’s just a ski instructor

What kind of happiness can this union bring?
Ooooh oooh oooh oooh
He'll consummate this love
Yo-oh-deling
Ooooh oooh oooh oooh ooooh
(Gina, Gina)
It's all about Gina
Sweet, sweet
(Gina, Gina)
It's all about Gina, Gina
Sweet, sweet

Gina, Gina
(Gina Gina)
Don’t leave us, don't leave us, don't leave us babe
Sweet, sweet
Gina, Gina
(Gina Gina)
It's all about Gina, Gina
Don't leave us, don't leave us babe
Gina, Gina
(Gina Gina)
Gina, Gina
(Gina Gina)
Gina, Gina
(Gina Gina)Embed
