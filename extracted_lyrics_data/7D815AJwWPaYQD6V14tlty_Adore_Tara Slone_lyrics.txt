1 ContributorAdore LyricsYou feel so near
But this coast has never been clear
Been here before
Don't know what I'm hanging 'round for
I won't wait for you
Though I adore you
Dreams we can't own
Always waking though they seem close
So we may try
You still have yours, you can't be mine
Though our love is true
(For this I thank you)
I won't wait for you
Though I adore you
Though you make me free
You have to save me
I won't wait for you
Though I adore you
One last goodbye
'Til we meet in our next lifetimeYou might also likeEmbed
