Girl i see how you're looking at me
And i must say you're looking sexy
But the truth is my baby has been good to me
Girl the way that you move's so tempting
Gotta say that I like what I see
But the truth is my baby has been good to me

Friday, I saw you looking my way
I know that you've wanted me
I can see it in the way you've been taunting me
Your eyes make it hard for me to walk away
When the truth is I want to stay
All I gotta say is girl there's just no way


In my mind i've made love to you a thousand times
But that is where i draw the line
I could lose everything that it took so long to find
Let me be as clear as i could be
Though you do what you do to me
I gotta tell you girl there's just no way

She's been good to me
She's the only one who ever really stood by me
She believes in me
She's the only one who ever took a chance on me
So girl there's just no way
