3 ContributorsDown in the Dark Lyrics
Baby, you're going down in the dark
Show my lonely night is falling
I don't have very long
I think my blood might boil
Within my veins might burn
And you're gonna make it better for a little while

Baby, you're gonna die someday
See you when you're crawling wasted
Then you'll start to fade
Laugh when we start sinking faster
I wouldn't wait so long
It won't get any easier in the dark

Oh yeah
You will, you will
You will
You will, you will

Baby, you're going down in the dark
Believe my lonely night is falling
I don't have very long
Think my blood might boil
Within my veins might burn
And you're gonna make it better for a little while
You might also like
Oh yeah
You will, you will
You will
You will, you will
You will
You will, you will
You will
You will, you willEmbed
