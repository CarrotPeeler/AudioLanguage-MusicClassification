11 ContributorsGrotesque Impalement LyricsI am lost
Far from the cross you stand before
Filled with lust
We are all filled with lust
We want this whore
Impale your flesh
Draped in darkness
Your guts explode and life has ceased behind your eyes
Impalement, and before
Live no more, live no more, overcome by fever
Malevolent disgrace
Wretching with repulsion
Bleeding from the eyes
Fester with redemption
Your blood begins to clot
Clogging the corpuscles in your mind
Ignoring the pretention
Wallow in the rot
Seven lives have come and gone
The first and the last
And what are we even here for?
Some twisted, mindless game?
Or is god just playing tricks upon my brain?
The birth of death begins
And with your life it ends
My world immersed in hate
Destroy what I create, defecate
Choke on my shit, urinate
Drown in my piss
Godless, hater of the world
Your mind dwells on the absurd
As I contemplate your horrible demise
Blood streams down your face
Drained, drained of lifeSee Dying Fetus LiveGet tickets as low as $48You might also likeEmbed
