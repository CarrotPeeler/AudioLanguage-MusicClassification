Outcast

I feel the power of the rage
You cannot close me in your cage
You cannot hurt me anymore
I'm ready for the war
I know I'm not alone
Every day, I feel your soul
I know you feel the same
When they speak our name:

Outcast
Outcast
Outcast

My life, it's only mine
You call me "outcast"
You even give me power
You hate will make me stronger
You hate will make me stronger
You might also likeOutcast—I'm outcast
Outcast—I'm outcast

I feel the power of the rage
You cannot close me in your cage
You cannot hurt me anymore
I'm ready for the war
I know I'm not alone
Every day, I feel your soul
I know you feel the same
When they speak our name:
