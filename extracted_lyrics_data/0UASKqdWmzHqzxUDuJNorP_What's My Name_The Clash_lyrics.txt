21 ContributorsWhatâ€™s My Name Lyrics
What the hell is wrong with me?
I'm not who I want to be
I tried spot cream and I tried it all
Crawlin' up the wall

What's my name?
Name
Name

I tried to join a ping-pong club
Sign on the door said "All full up"
I got nicked, fightin' in the road
The judge didn't even know

What's my name?
Name
Name

Dad got pissed so I got clocked
Couldn't hear the Tannoy so he lost the lot
Offers mum a bribe through the letter box
Drives you fucking mad
You might also like
I'm 'round the back of your house at night
Peepin' in the window, are you sleepin' tight?
I laugh at your locks with my celluloid strip
And you won't know who came

What's my name?
Name
Name
What's my name?
Name
