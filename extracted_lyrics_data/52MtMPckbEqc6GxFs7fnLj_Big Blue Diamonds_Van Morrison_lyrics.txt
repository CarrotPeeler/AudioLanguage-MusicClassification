Big blue diamonds on her finger
(On her finger)
Instead of a little band of gold
(Big blue, big blue diamonds)
Big diamonds (big diamonds)
Big blue diamonds (big diamonds)
Tell the story
Of a love, that no one man could hold
(Blue diamonds)
Oh, she wanted more than I
Had money to buy, so she left me
Sad and lonely, I am told
(I am told)
Big diamonds (diamonds)
Big blue diamonds (diamonds)
Now she'll trade them
For a love behind a little band of gold
(The band of gold)

To warm your heart n' soul?

When you're lonesome in the moonlight
An you want lovin', yeah
Big blue diamonds (diamonds)
Don't they seem so reckless and bold?
(Big blue diamonds)
I'd gladly to my part
Oh, mend a broken heart (big diamonds)
With a love that's warmed over (love soon grows cold)
Soon grows cold (it soon grows cold)
Big diamonds (diamonds)

I don't want them, no!
Oh, I just want a love behind
The little band of gold
