1 ContributorQuestion Marks Lyrics
We fall in love
Happy as clams
Play out our roles
Bleed until there's nothing left

We fall in love
Happy as mud
Play out our parts
Tear each other down
No regrets

Question our sanity each time we say
That there is nothing wrong with us
Question our needs every time that we stay
Don't understand what's wrong with us

We fall in love
Happy as bugs
Play out our hands
Feed until there's nothing left

We fall in love
Happy as shit
Play out our games
Wear each other down
No regrets

Question our sanity each time we say
That there is nothing wrong with us
Question our needs every time that we stay
Don't understand what's wrong with usEmbed
