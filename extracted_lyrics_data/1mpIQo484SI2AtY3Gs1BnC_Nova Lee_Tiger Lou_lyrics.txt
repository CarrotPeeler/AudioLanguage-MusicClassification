2 ContributorsNova Lee LyricsThe night is young but not as young as me
We've got plenty of hours to drink before we
Throw our last coins down the wishing well
I haven't got anything left to sell
Hey you know
I don't feel like coming down
Hey you know
That tonight is the night
The night is young but not as young as me
A share a cigarette with the sweet nova lee
She tells me how i help her sleep at night
My mere precense just makes her feel allright
Oh my precious nova lee
This is it and we have to believe
Nothing can come between
Me and you and the night
