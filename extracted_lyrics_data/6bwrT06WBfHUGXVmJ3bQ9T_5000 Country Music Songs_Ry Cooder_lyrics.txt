1 Contributor5000 Country Music Songs Lyrics
I started writing country songs in 1962
Just a dream that I had on my mind
Now my girl and I got married in 1963
We tried so hard to keep our dreams alive

So I bought an old house-trailer out on the country side
You can't write country songs in town they say
(That's what they told me)
Well we packed up and moved out there and as the time went by
We found that we liked living free that way

Now I got me an old Cadillac just to have around
Cadillacs and country songs were meant to be
I heard that old Hank Williams, well he drove one just like mine
So I thought that something might rub off on me

You can take what you want after I'm gone
It's only just a little place that we called home sweet home
It was one old house trailer, two rusty Cadillacs
And 5000 country music songs

Now I always sent my songs up to Nashville town
In case the boys couldn't use a guy like me
But the mailman brought 'em right back down and I think it made him sad
You're bound to get you one, just wait and see
You might also like
Well I recall the year that Ray Price came through town
His tour bus parked about a mile from here
But I just sat there in the backseat of that old Coupe De Ville
Those shoes were just too big to fill that year

And a song on Bobby Bare would take you anywhere
If I'm still here it wasn't for lack of trying
My wife would tell me, "Honey, now I'm feelin' somethin' there
Don't care if Bobby never reads a line"

You can take what you want after I'm gone
It's only just a little place that we called home sweet home
It was one old house trailer, two rusty Cadillacs
And 5000 country music songs

Then late one summer evening she called me to her side, saying
"Sing me something in your real old style
The one I like to hear Bobby Bare passed by
I'll just close my eyes and rest a while"

Now she liked that big old tree and the honeysuckle vine
A mockingbird that sang so tenderly
Well I just packed up all those song words and my old guitar
I locked 'em up and threw away the key
So mister, take what you want after I'm gone
It's only just a little place that we called home sweet home
It was one old house trailer, two rusty Cadillacs
And 5000 country music songs
And 5000 country music songsEmbed
