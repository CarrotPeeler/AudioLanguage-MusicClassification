Say we have got no dope
All I got is my 40
I have got nobody
That I can call my Shorty

I'd like to give a shout out to all the g-y-p’s and
Individualize because I am an MC. I can because I care
Because my family's there because I, because I
Because I appreciate the mentality of music
Saving all my sentences unless of course I'm smoothly spoken
Quiet type the kind to watch out for
No man of the clan perpetrating the scam
Sure I'm the boy with the Fallopian voice
Straight from the sleeve of any wizard of choice
I got the reason to be roaming out the coverage area
Send me the bill if all my loving is scaring you
Dare you to dream the way that I believe
Got the skill to go commando in any fatigues
I got the best damn band in the music scene
Oh I can even flow solo or just let it be
Because of the love
Oh the self-realization is the if, and, or buts
Because you got to know your name before you play-a the game
Keep a level-headed check on your health and stay sane
Address the tack on the track put the needle on the record and
Prepare for playback
Sajak, could I buy another vowel?
I need another clue and I could also use a towel
And how goes the medium tempo
Slaying all the teachers like the class of '84
And down low you know that my fidelities low
And I would never hurt a fly with my flip-flops on
Got control
Even keep a clean toilet bowl
2000 flushes blue and it's still going strong
Do I do what I do for the sake of the song?
Coming through on the radio it's for you
This is proof my own story's a spoof
I'll always be a gypsy or forever be aloof
And if you never get to liking me it's okay too
Well you've made it this far so pay a toll at the booth
Yes, you've made it this far so pay a toll at the gate
Yes, you've made it this far so pay attention to that
Yes, you've made it this far so sing along with the guy in the hat
You might also like

True or false? I can be a sensitive man
With sensible plans for the everyday woman
And I can keep you eating out the palm of my hand
Because the dope that we smoked was grown on my land
The words I burn they don't come from a can
The movie in my mind will be the winner at Cannes
So take your chance a plot of full or part-time romance
Clever as a bell don’t measure up to whatever
Because it don't matter how tall, how fat, or how small
The equal opportunity is open to all
The casting call the line forms down the hall
All you need is ID that shows that you're legal
But people with egos, a freak show, a syndrome, you best not go
Because you know I don't need those
And if there is a problem that I really ought to read
Post it on the web care of R-K-O-P
It's easy like me but a bit less the sleazy
Go heavy on the melody and add a little cheese
And if you can't stand the kitchen, get the hell out the heat
To meet with the geek all you need is a heartbeat
And to meet with the geek on the street
All you got to do is know how to repeat, repeat
So come on and sing this chorus with me

Well, I'm type A positive and just the way I like it
Right away I'm satisfied with my food before I try it
Can't deny it to save my life, I'm never lying
To brave this mic without the same thing twice
Is actually an act to staying up all night
With the mood just right
And the purchase of a flight from the west coast
To the northern lights
It's aurora borealis' company that I'm tight with
Despite all the things that you've heard
I'll admit that most is true and I'll be keeping my word
By doing double-duty on a search for new verbs
I'll report to work early to deliver the worm
With a back well covered by the buddies of ease
And no way in hell that I could ever catch a disease
And breaking all the codes on the latest machines
Well I'll even let you download me for free
