He just won't admit it
That he likes me
That he likes me
I can tell by the look in his eyes
That's he into me
'Cause when he passes by, says hi
I can tell by his smile, he's as shy as can be
(He's playing)
I don't think he can see my crush on him
But I can feel his crush on me
He's playing hard to get
He just won't admit it
That he likes me
That he likes me
I can feel his vibe for me
Even though he hasn't said a word
I bet he's glad I'm reading his mind
Coz there's so much he wants to say
But he doesn't have the nerve
And all that he doesn't say, I'm sure
I see it in his eyes

You don't have to say a word
But I still know how deep
The feelings are you have for me
Your smile and the look in your eyes
Says more than any words you could ever speak
Come on baby
So why are you doing this
