1 ContributorTime Flies LyricsGod Willing
Man,I gotta see a million
Views From out The Hole
Got me changing how I'm living
Crabs in a bucket
Had To change my position
Turned to Edward Scissor Hands
Just to slay opposition
But anyway dawg
I changed my position
Used to have it way back
But ya'll ain't really listen
Would've known since I dropped way back
That's if ya'll really listened
Used to play the victim
Now I turn em into victims

From the Somersall Road
Make this money somersault
You might also likeIf ya'll don't make it, PROMISE that's ALL YOUR FAULT
I hear a lot talk talk
But I know bullshit walks
Like I
Heard time flies
But DAWG, you don't trip for free
My time is money b
And I don't work for free
I been up on RAMGOAT Hill for TOO long you see?
Ram turned me the goat.  The real MVP
Like
Why GET degrees?
When they checking our degrees
Bath cloth to you head
Like Yo shit is hot B
Love you and they hate you
When your shit is cocky
But forreal, I'm gone get it
Opinions won't stop me
Like I heard time Flies 
But mines is on the stoplist
That means no time for you dawg
Get ya watched fixed
Confined space
Made me confined with my real gift
Ya'll made to something y'all couldn't deal with

Verse 2
Had this girl with a little more fashion sense
Than the common sense
The common ground
Was the common scent
Showed her my potential
Now she gotta witness it
Cause I been Heaven sent Ma
I'm tryna deal with it
I been taking blessings as they come
Ain't counting shit
But I Been tryna make these days count though. LEGIT
Speak my poetry into existence
That's how I fix shit
Either that or that's my angels
Man they be on they shit
Time Flies boy
I'm private with my shit
Cause the people round me could
Break me or keep me lit..
Since I started, ain't been starving
You know how I get
I gotta eat.  This ain't me
This the hunger
Hand me a snickers
Probably calm the bars down
Never mind then forget it
Cause I been Building the Buzz
Buzz the Mason
That may son, Any nigga that
May come
Buzz out,so the buds out
I loved the May Sun
Time Flies
I been buzzing with my shit
I know you heard me all up in your ear
Though. LEGIT
Like
I know
You heard bout the birds & the bees
Birds come and go
Buzz been here for centuries
Been fucking up the game, they made stories about me
So before my time
Was tryna tell you
Now you see
In the beehive every night
King tryna WRITE
So only way I'm coming out
Is if I'm swollen right?
MAKE MOVES MERELY off instinct
Must be chosen right?
So Either God chose me Or I just chose it right
Buzz got the pheromones
To attract them birds
So I got them when I want them
But this music first
They can't let go
Some sticky situationships
HONEYüçØ
I don't even know what it is
Something like HONEY, I'm just vibing with it
Smooth riding with it
Them past relationSHIPS, ALL ended like the Titanic
Growing Colder everyday
ICE AGING
Just because of it3Embed
