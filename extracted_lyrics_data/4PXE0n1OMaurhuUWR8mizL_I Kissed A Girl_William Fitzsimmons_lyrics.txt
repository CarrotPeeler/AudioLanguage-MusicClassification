3 ContributorsI Kissed A Girl LyricsThis was never the way I planned, not my intention
I got so brave, drink in hand, lost my discretion
It's not what I'm used to, just wanna try you on
I'm curious for you caught my attention
I kissed a girl, I liked it, taste of her cherry Chap Stick
I kissed a girl just to try it, I hope my girlfriend don't mind it
It felt so wrong, it felt so right, don't mean I'm in love tonight
I kissed a girl, I liked it
No, I don't even know your name, it doesn't matter
You're my experimental game, just human nature
It's not what good girls do, not how they should behave
My head gets so confused, hard to obey
I kissed a girl and I liked it, the taste of her cherry Chap Stick
I kissed a girl just to try it, I hope my girlfriend don't mind it
It felt so wrong, it felt so right, don't mean I'm in love tonight
I kissed a girl, I liked it
You girls you are so magical, soft skin, red lips, so kissable
Hard to resist, so touchable, too good to deny it
It ain't no big deal, it's innocent
I kissed a girl, I liked it, taste of her cherry Chap Stick
I kissed a girl just to try it, I hope my girlfriend don't mind it
It felt so wrong, it felt so right, don't mean I'm in love tonight
I kissed a girl, I liked itYou might also likeEmbed
