1 ContributorLatent Lyrics
Born with a bang, a flash of light
Standing on two feet, learning wrong from right
Doing things first, not yet asking why
Mapping out the world, filling in the space
Striking up a balance between give and take
No reasons yet to fear making a mistake

Opening a closed file
Poke around and stay a while
Break it into parts
And catalogue what’s in the heart
A latent state of agency
And worn-down naivety
Try to piece it back together
But this time make it better

Bathing in the night, pulling down the moon
Linger by the cars and singing our tunes (aah-aah)
Nothing behind us, nothing yet to lose
I’ll find a nеw thread in the shape of a cloud
I'm scarеd I’ve seen too much, I’m tightening the value
I’m pumping out the water, but I might just drown
You might also like
Opening a closed file
Poke around and stay a while
Break it into parts
And catalogue what’s in the heart
A latent state of agency
And worn-down naivety
If I piece it back together
Will this time be betterEmbed
