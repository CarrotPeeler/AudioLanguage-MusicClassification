4 ContributorsFractal Dream of a Thing LyricsTo some reality appears normal
To me it seems vested with an important light
Particular, a light
Sacred, a light
To address this universe
With nobility, emotions
As long as man will exploit man
As long as humanity will
Split between masters and servants
As long as man will exploit man
Split between masters and servants
There will be no normality and no peaceYou might also likeEmbed
