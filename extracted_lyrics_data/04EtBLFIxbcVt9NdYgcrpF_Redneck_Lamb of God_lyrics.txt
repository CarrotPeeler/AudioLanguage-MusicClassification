Woah!

So goddamn easy to write this
You make it spill on the page
So drunk on yourself, self-righteous
The laughingstock of your own fucking stage

But I ain't one to call names
Or throw stones in a house of glass
You try me

This is a motherfucking invitation
The only one you could ever need
This is a motherfucking invitation
You try me

Just one time, you got a reason
Heard you had nothing to lose
A blind preacher for the pin-eyed congregation
It must be easy to lose
You might also like
But I ain't one to call names
Or throw stones in a house of glass
You try me

This is a motherfucking invitation
The only one you could ever need
This is a motherfucking invitation
You try me


You can tell the same lie a thousand times
But it never gets any more true
So, close your eyes once more
And once more believe
That they all still believe in you

Just one time

This is a motherfucking invitation
The only one you could ever need
This is a motherfucking invitation
Just one time
This is a motherfucking invitation
You try me
Just one time
You try me
Just one time
You try me
You try me4Embed
