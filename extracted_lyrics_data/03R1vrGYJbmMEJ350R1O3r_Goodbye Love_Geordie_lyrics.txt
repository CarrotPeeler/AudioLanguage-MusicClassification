Goodbye love
I've been hot on the heels of a heartbreak
Since I started out with you
Tryin' to patch up your world which was broken in two
And all I ever got for my troubles was rejection
That's why trusting you was more than I could do
You're a no good woman
You took my money
You said it was just too bad
You don't wash my clothes
Or call me honey
But I don't feel so sad
But baby
How can I lose what I never had?
Goodbye love
Goodbye love
I meant every word that I said
When I told you "It's over!"
(Do you hear me?)
But you just pedalled steel
And played it your way
You might also likeWell, it's too late now for us
To speak of changes
'Cause we've been living together
For more than one day
You're a no good woman
You took my money
You said it was just too bad
You don't wash my clothes
Or call me honey
But I don't feel so sad
So tell me maybe that's true
Still I say to you
Goodbye love
Goodbye love
Goodbye love
Goodbye love1Embed
