And if we worry, will we get to bambonzoo
The backup open on the head gets around
 had a beating but it's not really long
The peak up being in the head gets so warm
The hada fucking, driving it's not very loud
Yeah I'm going but it's really not supposed to
And if we worry, will we get to bambonzoo
The backup broken in the head against the wall
The hot sauce beating but it's not for very long
The beak out beating in the head against the wall
The hada fucking but it's never really loudYou might also likeEmbed
