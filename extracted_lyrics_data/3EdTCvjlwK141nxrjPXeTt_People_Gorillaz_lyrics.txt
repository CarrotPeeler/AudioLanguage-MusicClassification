People, people, everybody people
Everybody making a sound
People, people, everybody people
Everybody standing their ground
People, people, everybody people
Everybody making a sound
People, people, everybody people
Everybody standing their ground
(Oh, yeah)

If you dream to the top, you'll be over the edge
If you get it on side, you'll be taking a ditch
You'll be loving our love, but you don't know why
It's the time of the day, so we never excite
If your heart isn't there, so you might as well say
"I know it, I got it, but I know that time will set me together"

People, people, everybody people
Everybody making a sound
People, people, everybody people
Everybody standing their ground
People, people, everybody people
Everybody making a sound
People, people, everybody people
Everybody standing their ground
(Oh yeah)
