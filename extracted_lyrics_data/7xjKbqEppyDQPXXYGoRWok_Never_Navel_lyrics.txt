3 ContributorsNever LyricsNever going to let it get away from me again
Couldn't carry that weight if it had a handle on it
But you did, can't take it away
But you did, oh what could I say
To make it okay?
Never need to fear you'll be without me, I'm here
Others may have slipped through cracks, they seem to disappear
But it's through the tear that light can come in
I know you're scared, don't know who wouldn't be
Love with no place to go but into the undertow
The stranger that you had to get to know
But grief is not your foe
Never seen a picture sweeter than when you're at ease
How can such a broken heart still be so eager to please?
You silver the storm but it's not for you
I know he's gone but I'm coming home with youYou might also likeEmbed
