5 ContributorsWhen the Stars Begin to Fall Lyrics
One small blind guy
Watches the other

I'm looking for you, for it stops at you
What you said is the same thing teacher says
Down on the creek bed, in the big water
See me hide the pearls up your dress

Night crawler, midnight caller
Should've been me, baby don't look down
It should've been me
Night crawler, tightrope walker
Should've been me, baby don't look down
It should've been me

One small blind guy
Watches the other

One for sorrow, two for joy
Three for a girl, four for a boy
Five for silver, six for gold
Seven for a secret never to be told
You might also like
Night crawler, midnight caller
Should've been me, baby don't look down
It should've been me
Night crawler, tightrope walker
Should've been me, baby don't look down
It should've been me
One star

Night crawler, midnight caller
Should've been me, baby don't look down
It should've been me
Night crawler, tightrope walker
Should've been me, baby don't look down
It should've been me

One small blind guy
Watches the other

Hear that sucking sound?
Circus is in town
What's the lips and what you said to me?
I'm the psycho bit
Murder, admit it
The wire went around and down
Down, down, downEmbed
