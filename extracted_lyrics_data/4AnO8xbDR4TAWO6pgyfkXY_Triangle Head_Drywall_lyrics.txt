1 ContributorTriangle Head LyricsNow, south of drag-strip hollow
Right past deadman's curve
There's a message in a bottle
It's a scandal, have you heard
Now, the bishop's wife just closed the door
The birds don't fly there anymore
And the whole town is talking
The whole town is talking
Triangle head
He sets a big steel trap
He'll find you out with a secret map
He's a phantom spook and he drinks pink champagne
He lives at the end of a cul-de-sac
He got a crossbow with a hairpin sight
Targets change from night to night
So when you hit his big blockade
Into his muddy water you will wade
They call him triangle head
He got three ways to go
One's just past the hairpin turn
The rest are down below
Triangle head

He uses his dick for a walkin' pole
He walks a big black dog with a collar of spikes
He wears a belt of skin from a killin' last night
They call him triangle head
Triangle head
He got three ways to go
One's just past the hairpin turn
The other is down below4
Triangle head
He knows just what to do
Triangle head
The rest is up to you
