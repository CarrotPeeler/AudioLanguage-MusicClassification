4 ContributorsOn Saturday Afternoons in 1963 Lyrics
The most as you'll ever go
Is back where you used to know
If grown-ups could laugh this slow
Where as you watch the hour snow

Years may go by
Ah, years may go by

So hold on to your special friend
Here, you'll need something to keep her in:
"Now you stay inside this foolish grin..."
Though any day your secrets end
Then again

Years may go by
Ah, years may go by

You saved your own special friend
'Cause here you need something to hide her in
And you stay inside that foolish grin
When everyday now secrets end
And then again

Years may go by
Ah, years may go by
Years may go by
Ah, years may go by (Hmm)Embed
