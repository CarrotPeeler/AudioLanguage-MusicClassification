4 ContributorsIt Ainâ€™t Fair Lyrics
People
All around me
But I don't even
Have a friend
Lord knows
I been trying
And he knows
I just can't win
Everything I do
Yeah
Seems to turn
Out wrong
Sometimes
I wish now
That I never
Been born
Whoa

Nobody
Nobody cares
Nobody cares
Baby
You know
I've had my share
Just ain't fair
(Just ain't fair)
Just ain't fair
(Just ain't fair)
You might also like
Some folks
Got it easy
They live
The life of love
And play
Lord knows
I got
To struggle now
Trying
To make my way
I'm walking all day
I'm going to
Reach the town
I believe
I hope
I can make it yeah
Because my feet
Ain't gonna
Let me stop
Talking about
Jesus

Nobody
Nobody cares
Nobody cares
Baby
You know
I've had my share
Just ain't fair
(Just ain't fair)
Just ain't fair
(Just ain't fair)Embed
