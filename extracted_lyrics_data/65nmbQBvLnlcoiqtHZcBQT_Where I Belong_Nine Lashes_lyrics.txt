1 ContributorWhere I Belong Lyrics
As dark as the night
A terrible sight
I wandered far away from home
No way to escape
Though try as I might
But You found a gate to my surprise
I never knew You were there
Just wanting to help me up when the road got hard
I'll never go there again
Discovering where You are, where You are

I tried to carry the ache alone
Thought I could brave the cold (woah, woah oh)
I found that I couldn't change the old
Never could break the mold (woah, woah oh)

So take my slow beating heart
You are where I belong

A sleight of the hand
A change in the plan
I'd had it nearly figured out
Could not understand
Was I at the end?
I'd only sought to play pretend
You might also likeI never knew You were there
Just wanting to help me up when the road got hard
I'll never go there again
Discovering where You are, where You are

I tried to carry the ache alone
Thought I could brave the cold (woah, woah oh)
I found that I couldn't change the old
Never could break the mold (woah, woah oh)

So take my slow beating heart
You are where I belong

You are, You are the only one
You are, You are the only
You are, You are the only one
You are, You are the only
The only

I tried to carry the ache alone
Thought I could brave the cold (woah, woah oh)
I found that I couldn't change the old
Never could break the mold (woah, woah oh)
So take my slow beating heart
You are where I belongEmbed
