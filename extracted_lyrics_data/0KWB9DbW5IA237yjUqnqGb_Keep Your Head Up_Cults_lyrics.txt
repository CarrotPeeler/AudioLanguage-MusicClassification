5 ContributorsKeep Your Head Up Lyrics
Outside your reach
I took my chance there
I would like to see what's there
I would like to see what's there

How about we take a trip and start it all over?
How about you take me to Japan?
I would like to see you there
I would like to see you there

But don't
You
Expect
Me
To share
My love
With you
Oh, oh no

Gotta keep your heads up
Gotta keep your feet down
We don't want love
At least not from that crowd
You might also like
How about we make a quick memory together?
I would like to be in there
I would like to be in there

It's not an evil trick, you know that I told you
I'm not the kind that you repair
You can barely see what's there
You can barely see what's there

But don't
You
Expect
Me
To share
My love
With you
Oh, oh no

Gotta keep your heads up
Gotta keep your feet down
We don't want love
At least not from that crowd
Gotta keep your heads up
Gotta keep your feet down
We don't want love
At least not from that crowdEmbed
