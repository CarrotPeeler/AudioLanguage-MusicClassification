2 ContributorsWill You Be Mine LyricsI said hope, it gets better
Love the ones you love and disregard the rest
If it's broke, you best fix it
Never giving up 'til you got nothing left
Up in smoke, it don't matter
Watch the flames burn there, beautiful instead
Such a joke, but who's laughing
When you lost everything you ever seemed to have
Alright
And all I'm asking is that you'd be mine tonight
Hey, come on
And all I'm asking is that you'd be mine tonight
Take your chance, and don't waste it
Never fall in love to break a woman's heart
If you can't keep dreaming
You'll be better off together than apart
If its love, it gets better
Than the feeling that you had, now was the one
You got to work and keep pushing
'Til you realize that feeling, it is gone
Tell me the road is long, you walk I'll follow on
Give you the things I never had
I'll be there by your side, knowing that you are mine
We keep each other on the path

Hey, come on
And all I'm asking is that you'd be mine tonight
(Tonight)
(Tonight, tonight, tonight)
Tell me the road is long, you walk I'll follow on
Give you the things I never had
I'll be there by your side, knowing that you are mine
We keep each other on the path
Tell me the road is long, you walk I'll follow on
Give you the things I never had
I'll be there by your side, knowing that you are mine
We keep each other on the path
And all I'm asking is that you'd be mine tonight
Come on
And all I'm asking is that you'd be mine tonight
Yeah, come on
And all I'm asking is that you'd be mine tonight
Come on, come on
And all I'm asking is that you'd be mine
Come onEmbed
