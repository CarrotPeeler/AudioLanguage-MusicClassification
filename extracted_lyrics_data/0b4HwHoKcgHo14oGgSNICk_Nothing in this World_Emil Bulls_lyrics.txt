Mr. half baked
May I introduce to you
The incarnation of a conflagration
Get up
The harder you pull the tighter it gets
We're young and commited
We'll give you the whole nine yards
Yeah!
We'll never stop we'll never give up
Hungry at heart
Like we've been from the start
Yeah we'll never stop we'll never give up
Hungry at heart
Hungry at heart we know
There's nothing in this world that we couldn't do
Cause we're so hungry at heart there's nothing in this world
That we couldn't do
Only the future knows where this road will take us
We're about to find out
We've got the engine and the fuel
Yeah!
We'll never stop we'll never give up
Hungry at heart
Like we've been from the start
Yeah we'll never stop we'll never give up
Hungry at heart
Hungry at heart we know
There's nothing in this world that we couldn't do
Cause we're so hungry at heart there's nothing in this world
That we couldn't do
