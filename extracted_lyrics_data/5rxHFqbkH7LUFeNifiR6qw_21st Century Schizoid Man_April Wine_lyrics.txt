3 Contributors21st Century Schizoid Man LyricsCat's foot, iron claw
Neurosurgeons scream for more
At paranoia's poison door
21st-Century schizoid-man
Blood rack, barbed-wire
Politician's funeral-pyre
Innocence raped with napalm-fire
21st-Century schizoid-man
Dead Sea, blind man's greed
Poet's starving children bleed
Nothing he's got, he really needs
