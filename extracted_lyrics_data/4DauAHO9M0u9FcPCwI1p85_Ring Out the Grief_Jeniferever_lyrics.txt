1 ContributorRing Out The Grief LyricsHeaven's filled with the reflections
Of a thousand wishes, made out of
Fire. Something to hope for, a reason
To stay. I saw mine through a front
Room window so I grabbed my coat
And went outside
I found you standing on the side-
Walk and I found truth. I grabbed
My phone and crossed the street
Thank you for last spring. I hope
You are well. Here's to next year
Must it bring us both the days that
We've worked for
Here are hours that I can't recall
But I saw it on film. I seemed to be
Happy so I take it that I must have
Been. Next thing I know I sit on a
Couch, it's six in the morning on
January first. It's my brother's birth-
Day and you're still by my side
There might be fire
But fire soon turns us to ashesYou might also likeEmbed
