1 ContributorStop Breakinâ€™ Down Lyrics(Robert Johnson)
Everytime I'm walking all down the street
Some pretty mama start breaking down on me
Stop breaking down, baby, please, stop breaking down
Stuff is gonna bust you brains out, baby
Gonna make you lose your mind
You Saturday night women, now, you just ape and clown
You don't do nothing but tear my reputation down
Stop breaking down, mama, please, Stop breaking down
Stuff is gonna bust you brains out, baby
Yeah, it's gonna make you lose your mind
I love my baby ninety nine degrees
But that mama got a pistol, Laid down on me
Stop breaking down, baby, Please, Stop breaking down
Stuff is gonna bust you brains out, baby
Yeah, it's gonna make you lose your mind
Everytime I walking all donw the street, some pretty women
Start breaking down on me stop breaking down, mama, please,stop breaking downYou might also likeEmbed
