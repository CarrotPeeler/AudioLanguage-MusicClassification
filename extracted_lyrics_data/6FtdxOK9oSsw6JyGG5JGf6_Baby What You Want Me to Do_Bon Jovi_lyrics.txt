6 ContributorsLotto (Part 2) Lyrics
She know how to fuck a nigga (Mm-mm)
She know how to touch a nigga (Yeah)
She know how to suck a nigga (So I)
Always been fuckin' with
I just might fuck around and lose my mind
Let's find another nigga (Let's go)
She be actin' boujee on me
Attitude on a fuckin' nigga
She dancin' on my dick, no, you can't find this shit on TikTok
I'm hidden from behind, all you see is diamonds and my wristwatch
I be like, "Yeah"
I like me a sexy lil' gangsta
She like to treat me like a ho
She give what you want and say thank you

I don't give a fuck (Damn), I'll beat a bitch up (That's fucked up)
Scratch off like lotto, bitch, try your luck (Let's go)
Glock on my hip, surgeon tummy-tuck
Got your bitch in the crowd like, "34 what?"
Nigga, I'm better than your bitch, we, bitch
Please, like icе, make everybody freezе
Get on your knees, you cannot do me
Just lick on my pussy then you can leave
You might also like
34 came through like doomsday
With the steel to your brain like toupée
Pretty bitch and she mixed like Kool-Aid
Drop bombs on the beat like Hussein
34 came through like doomsday
With the steel to your brain like toupée
Pretty bitch and she mixed like Kool-Aid
Drop bombs on the beat like Hussein

Annie Oakley, light that bitch up like Smokey
Low-key, I'm a petty bitch but you owe me
No, we don't wait in line, they know me
Italian nigga eat my pussy like cannoli
(Play) Play with my pussy like guitar, Bon Jovi
Slowly, ride that nigga dick like pony
Oldie on my pussy, boy like OP
Soaking, make it sound off, macaroni
My only, I'm his Yvette, he Jody
Not phony, baby don't tell me, he show me
Can't hold me 'cause I get money on my lonely
Foreign, if it ain't that then I'm snoring

I don't give a fuck, I'll beat a bitch up
Scratch off like lotto, bitch, try your luck
Glock on my hip, surgeon tummy-tuck
Got your bitch in the crowd like, "34 what?"
Nigga, I'm better than your bitch, we, bitch
Please, like ice, make everybody freeze
Get on your knees, you cannot do me
Just lick on my pussy then you can leave
34 came through like doomsday
With the steel to your brain like toupée
Pretty bitch and she mixed like Kool-Aid
Drop bombs on the beat like Hussein
34 came through like doomsday
With the steel to your brain like toupée
Pretty bitch and she mixed like Kool-Aid
Drop bombs on the beat like Hussein

I don't give a fuck, I'll beat a bitch up
Scratch off like lotto, bitch, try your luck
Glock on my hip, surgeon tummy-tuck (That bitch Tia)
Got your bitch in the crowd like, "34 what?" (Italian nigga eat my pussy like cannoli)Embed
