1 ContributorKing of the New York Streets LyricsPeople called me the scandalizer
The world was my appetizer
I turned gangs into fertilizer
King of the New York streets
I broke hearts like window panes
For breakfast I'd eat nails and chains
To my kingdom I'd proclaim
King of the New York streets
I floored my accelerator
All the way to the equator
Just a local gladiator
King of the New York streets
Well, I was only sixteen years old
So what could I have known?
In my mind these passing years
The legend sure has grown
People come from miles around
To see my royal tenement crown
Always up and never down
King of the New York streets
Schools gave me nothing needed
To my throne I proceeded
Every warning went unheeded
King of the New York streets
You might also likeI stood tall from all this feeling
I bumped my head on heaven's ceiling
Shooting dice and double-dealing
King of the New York streets
Each time I jumped behind the wheel
Of a pin-striped custom Oldsmobile
The guys would bow and the girls would squeal
King of the New York streets
Local bullies I deflated
Back street jive that I translated
Top Ten girls were all that I dated
King of the New York streets
I didn't need no bodyguard
I just ruled from my backyard
Living fast, living hard
King of the New York streets
Well, I was wise in my own eyes
I awoke one day and I realized
You know this attitude comes from cocaine liesEmbed
