5 ContributorsMan with the Blues Lyrics
If you need some advice in being lonely
If you need a little help in feeling blue
If you need some advice on how to cry all night

Come to me I'm the man with the blues

I'm the man with a hundred thousand heartaches
And I've got most any color of the blues
So if you need a little shove in fouling up in love

Come to me I'm the man with the blues


If you need some advice in being lonely
If you need a little help in feeling blue
If you need some advice on how to cry all night

Come to me I'm the man with the blues
See Willie Nelson LiveGet tickets as low as $69You might also like
I'm the man with a hundred thousand heartaches
And I've got most any color of the blues
So if you need a little shove in fouling up in love

Come to me I'm the man with the bluesEmbed
