Sow good seeds
Everybody
Sow good seeds
Everybody
On the mountain
Down in the valley
You gonna reap
Just what you sow

Sow by walking
Sow by talking
Sow by everything you do
Don’t mind no one
Keep on sowing
You’re gonna reap
Just what you sow

Sow good seeds
Everybody
Sow good seeds
Everybody
On the mountain
Down in the valley
You gonna reap
Just what you sow

Hark the voice of
Jesus calling
Who will come and
Wake the dead
Tombs of mercy
Harvest waitin’
Here am I
Oh mercy me

They’ll talk about you
They’ll vilify you
Call you everything
Except Child of God
Pay no mind to
What they’re sayin’
They’re gonna reap
Just what they sow

Sow good seeds
Everybody
Sow good seeds
Everybody
On the mountain
Down in the valley
You gonna reap
Just what you sowEmbed
