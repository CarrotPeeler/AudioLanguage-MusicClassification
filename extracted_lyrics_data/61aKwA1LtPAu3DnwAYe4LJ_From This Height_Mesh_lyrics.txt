1 ContributorFrom This Height Lyrics
It takes a long time to fall from this height
It takes a long time to fall from this height
When this life is gone
You stuck with us, you saw the proof
You took a risk but then you, you got the truth
And all it takes to shut us down
Is the very thing that broght you that brought you around
And here we are on cource again
I can"t believe we'll ever
We"ll ever feel the same

You come to us with open minds
You make a choice on what your, your heart decides
And all it takes to whip it outIs a greedy hand
That feeds a, that feeds a greedy mouth
And here we arе
On cource again
I never thought wе'd ever
We"d ever feel the same
You might also like
You never want to let it go
You never want to let it go
You never want to let it go
You never want to let it go

It takes a long time to fall from this height
You never want to let it go
It takes a long time to fall from this height
You never want to let it go
When this life is gone
It takes a long time to fall from this height
You never want to let it go
It takes a long time to fall from this height
You never want to let it go
When this life is gone
It takes a long time to fall from this height
You never want to let it goEmbed
