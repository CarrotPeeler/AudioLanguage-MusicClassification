1 ContributorThe Curse of Sharon Lyrics
Shadows in black
As the hourglass cracks
The candlelight's burning
As I realized
The world of tomorrow
The haunted yesterday
Spin the wheel of emotion
As I saw your face...

...For the first time, are we gone
Tomorrow
My final breath; your final tear

Shapes flying high
The taste of pure incense
I hold your shaking hands
Or will holy water heal?

In the middle of a long, dark, lonely road
Will you spread your wings again?
Can I cure your lost soul?
Tonight and heaven cries
My silent Babylon
It's the curse of Sharon
The curse of Sharon
You might also like
Our hands tied together
Wired with thorns
I've done everything to help you
At the end of times
Couldn't save you from your fears
Couldn't dry your falling tears
Will it be our last night?
How far can we go...?

...Till the last time, are we gone
Tomorrow
My final breath; your final tear

In the middle of a long, dark, lonely road
Will you spread your wings again?
Can I cure your lost soul?
Tonight and heaven cries
My silent Babylon
It's the curse of Sharon

The end of time (time, time)
The end of time (time, time)
The end of time (time, time, time, time)
The end of time (time, time)
Sharon!

In the middle of a long, dark, lonely road
Will you spread your wings again?
Can I cure your lost soul?
Tonight and heaven cries
My silent Babylon
It's the curse of Sharon
In the middle of a long, dark, lonely road
Will you spread your wings again?
Can I cure your lost soul?
Tonight and heaven cries
My silent Babylon
It's the curse of Sharon

The curse of Sharon
(Time, time
Time, time)Embed
