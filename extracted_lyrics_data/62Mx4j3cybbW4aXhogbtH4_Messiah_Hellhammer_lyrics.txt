6 ContributorsMessiah Lyrics
Is this our way
Or can we turn?
Extermination day
This world will burn

Messiah
Messiah

God has shoved his son
You drawed him
Now it's time
Let's pray Satan's mass
Six, six, six
East against the West
Son of Jackal
Atomic force kills the rest

Messiah
Messiah

You had your time
So follow him
Your soul is ours
World bursts and breaks
Satan's hordes strive to kill
Vultures of steel seed death
No escape, time stands still
Feel his deadly breath
You might also like
Messiah
Messiah

See the dead of the sun
Christian love in vain
Father killed by son
Mother raped in pain
In a world of steel
Made from stone
Only death is real
