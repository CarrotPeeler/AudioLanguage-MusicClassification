3 ContributorsLove Is the Rage LyricsWoman
If I were a woman
I would be man enough to keep you warm
And boy If I were a man
I would be strong enough to hold you tight
And when I cry
And I'm in a mood
I will try to keep on loving you
Love is divine
Love is the rage
Leave me alone
Lovely day
Love is bizarre
Lover be mine
Don't wanna lose ya
Love is divine
Love is the rage
Melancholy
Don't wanna go
Lovely time
Lover be mine
Don't wanna lose ya

If you were my lover
Would you be kind enough to take no other?
Boy
If I were a man
Would I be strong enough to practice what I preach?
When you're out of reach
I would sigh and stumble through my speech
Love is divine
Love is the rage
Leave me alone
Lovely day
Love is bizarre
Having a laugh
My Love'll do ya
Love is divine
Love is the rage
Melancholy
Don't wanna go
Lovely time
Lover be mine
Don't wanna lose ya
Love is divine
Love is the rage
Leave me alone
Lovely day
Love is bizarre
Having a laugh
My Love'll do ya
Love is divine
Love is the rage
Melancholy
Don't wanna go
Lovely time
Lover be mine
Don't wanna lose ya
Love is divine
Love is the rage
Leave me alone
Lovely day
Love is bizarre
Having a laugh
My Love'll do ya
Love is divine
Love is the rage
Melancholy
Don't wanna go
Lovely time
Lover be mine
Don't wanna lose yaEmbed
