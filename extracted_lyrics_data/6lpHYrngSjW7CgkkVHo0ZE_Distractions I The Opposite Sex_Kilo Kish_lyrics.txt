there’s a ghost in the hall
and its waiting out for ya
there’s a ghost in the hall
and it’s looking over you
when it calls when it calls
i can’t help but be amused
when it calls when it calls
what the fuck am i supposed to do?
its a ghost.
i let him go him go
let him go
but it keeps on creeping in
i let it go let it go
but how can i pretend
i wanted this?
i want to be involved
with a man
i want to feel him all
and within
i want to fall in love
once again
cause it controls me
so how can i
become the victim?
it’s a game, but i
can’t help but play it
i can’t blame it all
on creaking floorboards
and slammed doors
you know i’m that bitch
thats running straight into the woods
i trip,
and jason goes and gets me good,
you’ll roll your eyes
cause i was safe at home.
how can i become immortal?
save me from incessant boredom
don’t neglect me with your weapons
even if it kills me
flings me up into the ceiling
makes me have a demon baby, whatever
whatever, whatever1Embed
