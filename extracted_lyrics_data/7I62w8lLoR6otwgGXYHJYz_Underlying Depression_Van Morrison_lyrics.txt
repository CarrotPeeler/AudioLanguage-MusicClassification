Underlying depression
Have to crawl into my room
Underlying depression
Don't want to know about the moon in June
Outside there's a cavalcade of clowns
But they`re just bringing me down
With underlying depression

Underlying depression
And it's starting in my backyard
Underlying depression
And these times ain't even so hard
Lord I was born with the blues
And my blue suede shoes
And underlying depression

Underlying depression
And there's just nowhere to turn
Underlying depression
And things just seem to turn in on one
Sometimes I'm stuck here in the corner
Just like Little Jack Horner
With underlying depression
You might also like
Underlying depression
And I just can't get it right
Underlying depression
I've got to fight it with all my might
Right now I don't want to be alone
Get my baby on the telephone
Underlying depression

Have to make some concessions
When everything is working right
Have to count my blessings
Helps me make it through the night
I've got love in my life
As well as trouble and strife
And underlying depression

And underlying depression
And underlying depression
And underlying depression
Ain't nothing but the blues
Underlying depression ain't nothing but the blues
Underlying depression ain't nothing but the blues
Underlying depressionEmbed
