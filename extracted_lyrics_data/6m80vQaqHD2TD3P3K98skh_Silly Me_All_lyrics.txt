3 ContributorsSilly Me LyricsAlexander Charles “Silly Me feat. Young Savage”
Boss up
Yeah
(Why don’t you just listen for a minute?)
Silly me
Red hat with that Phillies P
Got friends who dealing real estate and homies who been dealing weed
Silly me
All you kids is killing me
Watch and see
I’m playing money ball, Billy Beane
I live the dream
So I don’t need no sleep at night
I used to pick the change up off my floor to grab a pizza slice
Whoa
And I savored all those moments cause that made me who I am now getting money’s just a bonus
Back when I was broke as hell I never asked for no ones help
Momma told me you won’t know a thing until you know yourself
That’s why I risk it all, even though I slip and fall
Cause I prefer to live and learn that’s life without a crystal ball, yeah
I might be preaching to the choir
But lately I been running out of people I admire, god damn
I guess things ain't the way they used to be so play this at my funeral and read this at my eulogy
You might also like
Never change all my homies really G
How they see me and that’s how I really be
Used to order dollar menu Mcd’s
Now I laugh laugh laugh silly me
I thought you was down for me silly me
Bought the same rolly twice silly me
I got lost in the sauce silly me
Now I laugh laugh laugh silly me

Spanish hippie revolution
You just talk you never do shit
I used to hustle door to door
And then I wanted more and more
I started rappin riding shotgun in my homies ford explorer
Just a kid who thought he knew it all, not the case
All the friends that I forget to call, my mistake
Atleast I can admit it ain't no helping ain't no stopping me
I said it and I did it I’m a self fulfilling prophecy
I miss my brothers, I wish Nate and Rob were free
And rest in peace darrony I’m just trying to make you proud of me
I’m positive my dominance is Rocky mixed with Popovich
I’m confident my shorty like a Spanish Erin Brokovich, eyy
I’m just trying to get my future right
Shame on me you got me once but you won’t ever fool me twice
I guess things ain't the way they used to be so play this at my funeral and read this at my eulogy
Never change all my homies really G
How they see me and is how I really be
Used to order dollar menu Mcd’s
Now I laugh laugh laugh silly me
I thought you was down for me silly me
Bought the same rolley twice silly me
I got lost in the sauce silly me
Now I laugh laugh laugh silly me
