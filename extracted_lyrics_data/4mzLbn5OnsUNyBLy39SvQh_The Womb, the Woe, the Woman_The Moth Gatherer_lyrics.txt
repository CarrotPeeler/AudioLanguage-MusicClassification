2 ContributorsThe Womb, The Woe, The Woman LyricsFloating in an endless crimson ocean
Through three seasons I was hidden away
Sheltered by skin and love
Maternal instincts kept me safe until everything caught flames
It's not the alcohol that kills
It's my heart, that broken thing
Head below water and a bottle of pills
The blood explodes in a circular ring
It's amazing what you can find
When you let go of your soul and skin
A life in the stream, warm and kind
The words of rebirth echoes within
A goddess, divinity in blood
Ascended, released into the wild
Left me behind in this dying world
Nothing was to be as beautiful again
Through the hollow cities I drag myself
With her love etched into my chestYou might also likeEmbed
