I want to kill all contact, slam another door
Third class substitutes, you are not welcome any more
If I leave this world today I do it for protection, for shelter
Protecting you from me, you will understand
You will understand eventually

Protecting you from me, you will understand
You will understand eventuallyYou might also likeEmbed
