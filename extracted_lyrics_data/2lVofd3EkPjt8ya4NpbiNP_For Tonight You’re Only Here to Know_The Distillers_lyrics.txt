5 ContributorsFor Tonight Youâ€™re Only Here to Know Lyrics
Really want you to sigh
Never in tune, sigh
I really want you to sigh
Never in tune, sigh

Just tonight, I would
I would lay here for you
Just tonight, I would
I would sink here for you
Just tonight, I would
I would slum here for you
Just tonight, I would
I would die

I really want you to sigh
Never in tune, sigh
I really want you to sigh
Never in tune, sigh

Where am, am I?
In the hallway, small
There's a red light
And a black sore
"Away," I say
"Away," I say
"Away," I say
"Away!"

You'll follow me 'til the end, 'til the end
(Away, yeah, yeah)
You'll swallow me 'til there is nothing left
(Away, yeah, yeah)
You'll follow me 'til the end, 'til the end
(Whoa-oh, whoa-oh, whoa-oh, whoa-oh)
You'll swallow me 'til there is nothing left
(Whoa-oh, whoa-oh, whoa-oh, whoa-oh)

Really want you to sigh
Never in tune, sigh
I really want you to sigh
Never in tune, sighEmbed
