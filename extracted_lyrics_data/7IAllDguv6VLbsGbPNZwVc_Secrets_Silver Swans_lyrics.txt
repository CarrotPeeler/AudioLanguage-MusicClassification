2 ContributorsSecrets LyricsAre you happy
I know you shiver like a stone
I know you can't be
When you have nowhere else to go
And your father came to find you here
I covered tracks to help you
And I don't think about you, anymore
I don't think about you, anymore
Maybe you're working
In a city far away
Maybe you're satisfied
With how boring life stayed
Told me you were gonna be
Really big or something
Don't know that it's everyone else
Who is disappointing
Secrets of our life
Secrets of our life
Secrets of our life
