2 ContributorsIâ€™m back and Bluer than ever LyricsI'm back and I'm bluer than ever!
Gold track with my whole life through!
I'm back and I'm bluer than ever!
You know it's true! I'm bluer than you!
I'm back and I'm a tower of power
Smoke stacks getting ready to blow
Stand back from the meteor shower
All I say is, on with the show...
Better stand back he's gonna blow!
He's back (back back back back)
He's back (back back back back)
I'm back and I'm bluer than ever!
You know it's true, I'm bluer than you!
You know it's true, I'm bluer than you!
