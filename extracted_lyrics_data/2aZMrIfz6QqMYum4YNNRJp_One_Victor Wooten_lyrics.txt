7 ContributorsRum, Women, Victory Lyrics
What should one do when darkens the sky
When in the horizon enemies’ sails arise?
What should one do when there is a need
To fool the approaching death, to do a hero's deed?

We rule the the Seven Seas - swords high for our Queen!
Shout for what we live, "Rum, women, victory!"
Shout for what we live, "Rum, women, victory!"

What should one do when the answer's not there
On the highest mountain, or the deepest sea bed?
What should one do if not fully alive?
Face looming death with a grin and the nectar of courage

We rule the Seven Seas - swords high for our Queen!
Shout for what we live, "Rum, women, victory!"
Shout for what we live, "Rum, women, victory!"

Shout! Shout! Shout! Shout!

We rule the Seven Seas - swords high for our Queen!
Shout for what we live, "Rum, women, victory!"
Shout for what we live, "Rum, women, victory!"See Ensiferum LiveGet tickets as low as $83You might also likeEmbed
