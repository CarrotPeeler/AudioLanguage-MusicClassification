1 ContributorBlack Empire LyricsHeavy rain, walking down to the sea
Hearing voices in my memories
Final piece to find the destiny
Fading sun will bring another day
In this Black Empire
Knocking at the darkest door
Take it away, do it again
It's time to make a change
In this Black Empire
Reaching for the endless dream
Aim to break the ball and chain
Never end, whispering melodies
Time to hold on, fight against the tide
Wait and see, fear is my legacy
Won't let go until I pay the price
In this Black Empire
In my heart and in my soul
Take it away, do it again
Rise up and dominate
In this Black Empire
Reaching for the endless dream
Aim to break the ball and chain

This gypsy road won't take me home
Doomed tomb
Fire your gun and walk ahead
Downbound
This gypsy road won't take me home
Doomed tomb
Look behind the reach for the end

In this Black Empire
Knocking at the darkest door
Take it away, do it again
It's time to make a change
In this Black Empire
Reaching for the endless dream
Aim to break the ball and chain
Downbound
This gypsy road won't take me home
Doomed tomb
Fire your gun and walk ahead
Downbound
This gypsy road won't take me home
Doomed tomb
Look behind the reach for the endEmbed
