Infinite subterranean abyss
All reality now crumbles
Descending through endless black pits
Pushing too far I hungered for knowledge
Wanting oneness with entities numinous
Punished for excess ambition
Tormented by evil spirits numerous
Tormented, still I push on
Why did I seek this communion chthonic?
Desire defying foreboding for death
Septic specters invading my body and spawning
A bane borne in my blood that is sapping my health
Possessed by the spirits of the underworld
Descend into madness as chaos unfurls
Lust for power of the ancients was my crime
Sentenced to eternal suffering for all time
Wanting too much, greed gets inside
Internalized sin, nowhere to hide
Internal
Nowhere to hide
The horrors inside me, haranguing, push on
Infection in my soul, all sanity is gone

Desire defying foreboding for death
Septic specters invading my body and spawning
A bane borne in my blood that is sapping my health
Possessed by the spirits of the underworld
Descend into madness as chaos unfurls
Lust for power of the ancients was my crime
Sentenced to eternal suffering for all time
Relentless, summon the Spawn
Possessed by the spirits of the underworld
Descend into madness as chaos unfurls
Lust for power of the ancients was my crime
Sentenced to eternal suffering for all time
Pitch-black passage concluding, as the portal now approaches
Red glow stings long-closed eyes, as light tendrils growing stronger
Emerge in immense cavern where foul odors lurking loathsome
And flesh melts from my frame! Skin cells functioning no longer
Magma monstrosity looming before me
Surging serpentine stream of still living flesh
Occult curiosity will finally be satisfied
What does eternity feel like, with no hope of death?
Compelled by my captors I walk to the shore
And madly fling myself into the burning waves
Melted, fragmented, physicality splintered
Yet each scattered cell to immortality enslavedEmbed
