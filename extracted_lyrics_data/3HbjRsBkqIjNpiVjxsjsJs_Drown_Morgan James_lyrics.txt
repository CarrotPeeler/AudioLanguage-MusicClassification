1 ContributorDrown Lyrics
I thought I knew how to hold my breath
I thought I had found all that I'd been left
I thought I was living close to death
I didn't know what to do

Honey, been lonely for these long days
Honey, believe in the one that stays

Go on and wade in the water
'Til it's over your head
Cause you been waiting with your heart out
Gotta go where you're led
Cause you will find me at the bottom when you come on down
Let yourself drown

I thought I would die if I lost my air
I thought if I disappeared then no one would care
I saw my salvation but there was nothing there
I didn't know about you

Honey, been lonely for these long days
Honey, believe in the one that stays
You might also like
Go on and wade in the water
'Til it's over your head
Cause you been waiting with your heart out
Gotta go where you're led
Cause you will find me at the bottom when you come on down
Let yourself drown

Won't you let me take you down?
Won't you let me take you down?

Better believe, believe in me
Better believe and breathe

Wade in the water
'Til it's over your head
Cause you been waiting with your heart out
Gotta go where you're led
Cause you will find me at the bottom when you come on down
Cause you will find me at the bottom when you come on down
Won't you let me take you down?
Let yourself drown
Won't you let me?
Won't you let me take you down?Embed
