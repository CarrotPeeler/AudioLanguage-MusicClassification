1 ContributorBirdâ€™s Eye Lyrics
Two  a day, all the way, somehow
Believe mistakes what  all the way, somehow
Somehow

Lay low when I ride by
Maybe down and out but my head high
 when I
Lay low when I
Lay low when I
Seen it all from a bird's eye
May have took a loss, it ain't the first time
Never compromise, I'ma get mine when I
Lay low when I
Lay low when I

I don't need an introduction
Don't need recognition for me to function
I believe that the work is more important
I've been putting in time, I never force it
I'm in love with the process, it's gorgeous
All the time in the world, I can't afford it
I've been running from the pain, I can't avoid it
I've been sprinting, I've been jumping
I've been ducking, I've been dodging
All the problems I can't hide from
Peace, do you got some?
Love, I can't find none
Lord, where the time gone?
Smoke till my mind gone
Sitting, I reflect thinking where it all went wrong
You might also like
Two  a day, all the way, somehow
Believe mistakes what  all the way, somehow
Somehow

Lay low when I ride by
Maybe down and out but my head high
 when I
Lay low when I
Lay low when I
Seen it all from a bird's eye
May have took a loss, it ain't the first time
Never compromise, I'ma get mine when I
Lay low when I
Lay low when I

I don't talk the talk, I'd rather show and prove
That we're here to help then I suggest you move
I control this shit, I steer, I never cruise
I don't wait around, there's plenty left to do
It's a train of thought, the way I think
I said I'm going down if the ship is sinking
Niggas jumping overboard to deeper waters
I can make them realize their plans are faulty
Never let them into my 
Wanna throw a temper tantrum, pity party
Niggas said they dedicated, that's the farthest
From the fucking truth that they could possibly be
I can't be you and you cannot be me
Anything worth having isn't free
Patience is a sickness, a disease
I pray that this perspective never leaves me
Two  a day, all the way, somehow
Believe mistakes what  all the way, somehowEmbed
