Forged in the black country
Under blood red skies
We all had our dream to realise
Driving in that Transit
Down to Holy Joe's
Used to lose our head while metal flowed

Nothing held us back or dared to try
Something in our blood won't let us die
We built our world of metal, watched it grow
Fueled the fury solid to the bone

Got to deal with the Devil
'Cause you know that it's real
Done a deal with the Devil
From a heart made of steel

Rollin' down the m-way
Took it to The Smoke
Bangin' heads there till we all went broke
When we don the leather
And the whips and chains
Nothing matters more, we can't be tamed
See Judas Priest LiveGet tickets as low as $76You might also like
Fighting through the din and accolades
Turn the phase around with razor blades
Watched the movement grow
Into one voice
Took on all the world
It had no choice

Got to deal with the Devil
'Cause you know that it's real
Done a deal with the Devil
From a heart made of steel

We hit at night, you're in our sight
Then we can feel what we've been waiting for
Let me hear you roar
Upon this stage we let it rage
And for a time we leave the world behind
To be with our own kind



Got to deal with the Devil
'Cause you know that it's real
Done a deal with the Devil
From a heart made of steel

Got to deal with the Devil
'Cause you know that it's real
Done a deal with the Devil
From a heart made of steel
Deal
Done a deal with the DevilEmbed
