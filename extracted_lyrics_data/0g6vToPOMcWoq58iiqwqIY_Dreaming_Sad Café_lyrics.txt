2 ContributorsDreaming Lyrics
You say that if you found a place in the game
How you'd be different, how you would change
Still dreamin'
Dreamin' after all these years

And if you didn't have the heartache and pain
How you'd be happy, but you'd be the same
Still lonely
Lonely after all those tears
Lonely after all these...

Years that you once had won't come back again
(Only dreamin')
Lost in your memory I just had to say

You do your best to make me think you're insane
You try and hurt me again and again
Still trying
Trying to deny those tears
Trying after all these

Years that you once had won't come back again
(Only dreamin')
Lost in your memory I just had to say
You're only dreamin'
Dreams that you once had, won't come back again
You're only dreamin'
Lost in an ocean with no one
You might also like

So if you never find a place in the game
I'll sing it to you, it's the same refrain
No crying
No more crying lonely tears
Happy after all these...

Years that you once had, won't come back again
Lost in your memory, I just had to say
You're only dreamin'
Dreams that you once had, won't come back again
Still dreamin'
Lost in an ocean with no one to say
You're only dreamin'Embed
