3 ContributorsLet Me Love You LyricsJust let me touch, let me hold
Let me feel, let me lose control
Let me taste, let me savor
What I've been so hungry for, my only flavor
Let me roar from so much pleasure
Just let me soar to heights no one can measure
With all my heart, all my mind
All my body and all my soul
Let me love you, let me love you
Please let me love you
Let me live with you please, please let me stay
Let me wake up beside you everyday
Let me treat you with kindness and  respect
Let me eradicate for your vocabulary
The words 'Abuse' and 'Neglect'
Let me bathe you at the end of your workday
And when dinner is over and the dishes are put away
Let me remove every stitch and every thread
I'll start with your feet, your toes on your head
Let me traverse your peaks and valleys
Your bright boulevards and your dark valleys
Let me play in your lush meadows
Your glistening stream, in and out of the shadows
You might also likeLet me give you the ride of your life
Even if it involves the whole night
You see, with all my heart, all my mind
All my body and all my soul
Let me love you, let me love you
Let me love you, please let me love youEmbed
