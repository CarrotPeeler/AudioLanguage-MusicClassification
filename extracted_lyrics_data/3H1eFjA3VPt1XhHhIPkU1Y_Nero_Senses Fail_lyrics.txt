6 ContributorsNero LyricsI spend my life driving without headlights
I'm running from who I am
I've got my back laid across the iron tracks
Waiting for life to pass
I hit the floor so hard
Cause I've been getting all my therapy at the bar
And this is the last time I'll try
When all the drinks are gone
And it's just me and the odyssey of the dawn
My shadow shows someone
(Who's afraid of the morning sun)

Just when I thought that it couldn't get much worse
I turned around and I saw you there tonight
So when will I get a break from life?
It's driving me to drink tonight
You know that you were my worst addiction
Now you're here after two years of being clean
So when will I learn to break routine
And forget you like a dream
I'm gonna say this sober so I have no excuse
I need you in my life like my neck needs a noose

You know that you were my worst addiction
Now you're here after two years of being clean
So when will I learn to break routine
And forget you like a dream
I set the fire
As I play my violin
I spend my life driving without headlights
I'm running from myself

You know that you were my worst addiction
Now you're here after two years of being clean
So when will I learn to break routine
And forget you like a dream
You know that you were my worst addiction
Now you're here after two years of being clean
So when will I learn to break routine
And forget you like a dreamEmbed
