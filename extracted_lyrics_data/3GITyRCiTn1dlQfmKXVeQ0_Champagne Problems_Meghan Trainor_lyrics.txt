22 ContributorsChampagne Problems Lyrics
I got champagne problems, champagne problems
So pour a glass and let's drink up all my champagne problems
I got champagne problems, champagne problems
So pour a glass and let's drink up all my champagne problems

Can't believe my Uber's late again (Oh, no, no, no)
Gon' be late for dinner with my friends (Oh, no, no, no)
These shoes hurt bad, can't feel my toes (Oh, no, no, no)
And I forgot my jacket back at home (Oh, no, no, no)

But I can't complain at all
(Life's too short for that, life's too short for that)
No, I can't complain at all (Life's too short for that)

I got champagne problems (Oh), champagne problems
So pour a glass and let's drink up all my champagne problems
I got champagne problems (Champagne), champagne problems
So pour a glass and let's drink up all my champagne problems

My new Wi-Fi doesn't seem to work (Oh, no, no, no)
No, no internet, that's the worst (Oh, no, no, no)
And my iPhone always seems to die (Die) (Oh, no, no, no)
Right before I hit reply (Oh, no, no, no)

But I can't complain at all
No no, life's too short for that (Life's too short for that)
No, I can't complain at all (Life's too short for that)

I got champagne problems, champagne problems
So pour a glass and let's drink up all my champagne problems
I got champagne problems (Yes, I got 'em), champagne problems
So pour a glass and let's drink up all my champagne problems

If you got champagne problems, drink them up
If you got champagne problems, drink them up
If you got champagne problems, drink them up
If you got champagne problems, drink them up

I got champagne problems, champagne problems
So pour a glass and let's drink up all my champagne problems
I got champagne problems, champagne problems
So pour a glass and let's drink up all my champagne problems
I got champagne problems, champagne problems
So pour a glass and let's drink up all my champagne problems
I got champagne problems, champagne problems
So pour a glass and let's drink up all my champagne problems
Oh, oh
Let's drink up all my champagne problems
My champagne problems
My champagne problems, hey
My champagne problems
Mmm, mmm3Embed
