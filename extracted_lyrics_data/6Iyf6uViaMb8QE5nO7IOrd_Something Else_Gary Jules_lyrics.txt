3 ContributorsSomething Else Lyrics
They never tell you
"Truth is subjective"
They only tell you
Not to lie

They never tell you
"There's strength in vulnerability"
They only tell you
Not to cry

But I've
Been living underground
Sleeping on the way
And finding something else
To say
Is like walking on the freeway

They never tell you
"You don't need to be ashamed"
They only tell you
To deny
You might also like
So is it true?
That only good girls go to Heaven?
They only sell you
What you buy

And I've
Been living underground
Sleeping on the way
And finding something else
To say
Is like walking on the freeway


Oh, I've
Been living underground
Trying not to burn
And finding something else
To learn
At Hollywood and WesternEmbed
