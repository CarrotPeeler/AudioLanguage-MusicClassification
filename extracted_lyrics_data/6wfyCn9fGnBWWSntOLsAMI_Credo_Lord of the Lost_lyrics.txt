Come on raise your hands

We give our hearts to the Lord Of The Lost
We live in the dark
Not in heaven we trust
We give our hearts to the Lord Of The Lost
We're ready to depart
Not in hell we do trust

Love is patient
Love is kind
It keeps no record of wrongs
Love doesn't boast
It isn't proud
It's light when all hope is gone
(We give our hearts to the Lord Of The Lost)

We give our hearts to the Lord Of The Lost
We live in the dark
Not in heaven we trust
We give our hearts to the Lord Of The Lost
We're ready to depart
Not in hell we do trust
We give our hearts to the Lord Of The Lost
You might also like
Love always trusts
Love always hopes
It always perseveres
Love isn't rude
It's coming for you
The hand to dry your tears
(We give our hearts to the Lord Of The Lost)

Come on raise your hands

We give our hearts to the Lord Of The Lost
We live in the dark
Not in heaven we trust
We give our hearts to the Lord Of The Lost
We're ready to depart
Not in hell we do trust
We give our hearts to the Lord Of The Lost

Do you know why I love walking in the rain?
'Cause no one sees that I am crying here all day
I love to sleep in the fields between the dead
'Cause no one sees that I am dying here instead

We give our hearts to the Lord Of The Lost
We live in the dark
Not in heaven we trust
We give our hearts to the Lord Of The Lost
We're ready to depart
Not in hell we do trust
We give our hearts to the Lord Of The Lost
We live in the dark
Not in heaven we trust
We give our hearts to the Lord Of The Lost
We're ready to depart
Not in hell we do trust
We give our heartsEmbed
