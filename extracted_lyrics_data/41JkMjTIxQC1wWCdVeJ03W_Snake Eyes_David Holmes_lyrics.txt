8 Contributors80 Bars Lyrics
80 bars, 80 scars
Yo, engineer turn me up, yo

I started off in the underground
From mono to stereo, now I'm surround sound
Blowing through your tubes, leaving holes through your speakers
Cracking through your tweeters, my frequency's off the meter
Jam pack arenas from here to Bangkok
I'm ahead of my time like Jimi Hendrix playing Woodstock
Me, I'm playing Hoodstock. Before I had the dreadlocks
I used to reminisce "Should I do music or sell rocks?"
Growed my own crops, living in the PJ's
That's when the Angel Gabriel said "It's all a Masquerade"
Eyes with no face, sneakers with no lace
I feel the Earth spinnin, but I'm standin in the same space
With no trace of what happened last night
I seen two fiends fighting over a crack pipe
Now I'm watching TV, my antenna was a clothes hanger
Blurry vision, Mister McGee Hunn, David Banner
Flip the data, the kids were wearing bandanas
Toting hammers aiming at your medulla oblongata
Blaow blaow, a young thug with a slim figure
Romantic type like the movie "Casablanca"
Herb seller once, got busted by undercover
Buyer, my supplier was a gypsy cab driver
That's when I realize I need to find a new hustle
Living in the jungle the guitar became my muscle
I strive through snake eyes that wanted me crucified
I thought that I was drowning but I was getting baptized
Now behold, I heard you sold 20 mill'
But with no street credibility, you're overkill
You ain't real, talkin bout keep it gangsta
Only if you knew the gangstas sent me to shank you
Gank you, yank you, tie up your ankles
And if that ain't enough, I call Henchmens to lynch you
Now, at the funeral, I can see the Priest bless you
But in the afterlife, I'mma still touch you
Knockin on heavens door, you're begging to get in
That's when the Son of Man greets you with the face of Satan
Now you look frightened in the belly of the whale
That's when the warden say "I wanna welcome you to hell"
Bones is 5 bucks, get off the phone, time's up
I seen him cut from his head to his (nuts)
You wish you wouldn't, wish you couldn't, wish it got to me
Cause you screamin so loud that a deaf man can hear
Back to the silence, no more droppin science
Er'body rappin about diamonds and violence
And A&Rs, all they do is charge credit cards
And when the bill comes, they blame it on the rap stars
Now how you figure? I ain't rent a car
I wasn't at the spa, I ain't buy the bar
Now here's a jewel when you get your first record deal
Don't subject yourself to the mass appeal
First Class, caviar in the ville
In the new S Class with the Jordan wheels
Remember, the music in the streets like the streets
You know the code of the streets, er'body tryin to eat
The evidence is concrete, I'm tired of the same song
You take me out, you must be high off heroin
Sharper than I ever been, this one gon get a 10
Rappers, I'mma murder y'all with your own medicine
I move with faith, I never have doubt
I'm so hungry you would think I'm just coming out
But I been here before, from Blunted to The Score
To The Carnival, Eclectic World Tour
I'm causin whores, waitin in the back doors
They want me to rock they boat and shift them onshore
That's when the Father said "Take me to this lesson"
They wanna cut your hair like Delilah did Sampson
I felt that, so I went back to my format
Raps and backpack, gats for carjacks
Hats for pussycats, cause Aids, I don't want that
And for the DJ's, here's something y'all can scratch
Technique 12, Benito hits the wax
Hypnotize the crowd, the dance floor is jam packed
Now sing along like a negro spiritual
No one got shot tonight, it's a miracle
But what's this I hear, y'all wanna take my spot?
You got a better chance putting a gorilla in a headlock
I'm too focused, I can see through your lens
You ain't a G, just a wannabe kingpin
So the next time, y'all wanna pay for protection
I suggest that you hit up the Haitian Sicilians
