1 ContributorHands Up Lyrics
Don't, don't, don't know
Like it's never gonna change
Don't, don't know

I can't find, I can't find my words right now
To describe what is really goin' on
I can't mind, I can't mind my own right now
And it's a world of insanity but it's my home

And I can't change it
But I can change myself
No, I can't change it
But I can change myself

Got so caught up in the world
Seems like it's never gonna change at all, no no
I just gotta throw up my hands
Some things I'm never gonna understand, oh no
Got so caught up in the world
Seems like it's never gonna change at all, no no
I just gotta throw up my hands
Some things I'm never gonna understand, oh no

Like it's never gonna change
Don't, don't know

I can't find, I can't find my peace of mind (I can't find it)
But I can close, I can close my eyes and see (I can close my eyes and see)
I can try, I can try to read between these lines (hey, hey, hey)
All I know is this is some 

But I can't change it
But I can change myself
No I can't change it
But I can change myself

Got so caught up in the world
Seems like it's never gonna change at all, no no
I just gotta throw up my hands
Some things I'm never gonna understand, oh no
Got so caught up in the world (got caught up)
Seems like it's never gonna change at all, no no (no no, no no, oh)
I just gotta throw up my hands
Some things I'm never gonna understand, oh no (I wonder if it's ever gonna change)
Got so caught up in the world
Seems like it's never gonna change at all, no no (ooh, baby, we can make it better)
I just gotta throw up my hands
Some things I'm never gonna understand, oh no (we can make it better, hey)
Don't, don't know
Like it's never gonna change (we can make it better, we can make it better)
Don't, don't know
Don't, don't, don't know
Like it's never gonna change (we can make it better, we can make it better)
Don't, don't knowEmbed
