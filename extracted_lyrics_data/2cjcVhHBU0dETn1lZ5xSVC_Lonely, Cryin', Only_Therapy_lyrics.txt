2 ContributorsLonely, Cryinâ€™, Only Lyrics
(Leave a message or leave me alone)

What if the sky falls? And shoves me into the ground
Would you pray for me? Or would you pull me out?
Yeah, I know you're no angel, but I'm stuck right now
Don't walk away, pretendin' you don't know how

Like a fat kid suicide, believing they're wrong
And you were givin' up early and goin' alone
Yeah, I know you're no angel, but I'm stuck for friends
And once I'm out, I won't be back there again

And if you're lonely (You're lonely), and you're cryin' all the time (You're cryin')
Heaven help me (Heaven help me), 'cos your heart's as dead as mine
We all go slowly (Go slowly) and time is catchin' up (Time is catchin' up)
If you would only (Only) give me two more minutes of your twisted love

Every day it gets much better
Everyone's on your side
Skies colliding in your name
Strike it up and lights and step outside, 'cos you know what's goin' on
You might also like
But if you're lonely (You're lonely), and you're cryin' all the time (You're cryin')
Heaven help me (Heaven help me), 'cos your heart's as dead as mine
We all go slowly (Go slowly) and time is catchin' up (Time is catchin' up)
If you would only (Only) give me two more minutes of your twisted love

(Your twisted) Your twisted love
(Your twisted) Your twisted love
(Your twisted) Your twisted loveEmbed
