Bounce
Rock, skate
Roll, bounce
Rock, skate
Roll, bounce
Rock, skate
Roll, bounce
Rock, skate
Roll, bounce

Roll, bounce
Rock, skate

Rollerskaters celebrate the disco way
Give your feet the freedom, let's bounce today
Rollerskaters, one in front and one behind
Bounce left, bounce right, it’s disco time
There ain't no stoppin', keep on rockin’, you're in the groove
This funky kinda music simply makes you wanna move
Rollerskaters, one in front and one bеhind
Bounce left, go on and

Bounce! (mmm) Rock, skatе (ro-o-ol)
Roll, bounce (gooo-oo-whoa-oo whoa)
Rock, skate (and do your thing, yeah)
Roll, bounce (boooounce, whoo!)
Rock, skate (ro-o-o-o-ol-o-o-o-ol)
Roll, bounce (yea-a-e-e-ah, whoa)
Rock, skate (doin' it!)
Roll, bounce

Disco dancers dancing to the disco beat
It ain't nothin' but a party so stay on your feet
Rock left, rock right, stay in the groove
Music is the answer, it really makes you move
Sexy ladies strutting their stuff so well
Laid out in the ladies' styles casting a spell
Watch them rock to the beat, feel the body heat
Come on, go on and get down

Rollerskaters celebrate the disco way
Everybody needs hot stuff, let's bounce today
Rollerskaters, one in front and one behind
Bounce left, bounce right, it's disco time
There ain’t no stoppin’, keep on rockin', you’re in the groove
This funky kinda music, oh, it makes you wanna move
Rollerskaters, one in front and one behind
Bounce left, go on

Bounce
Rock, skate
Roll, bounce (bounce)
Rock, skate (ska-a-ate)
Roll, bounce (booooooouuuuunce)
Rock, skate (bounce)
Roll, bounce (skate your thing, right on)
Rock, skate (skate)
Roll, bounce
Rock, skate (ska-a-a-a-ate)
Roll, bounce (bounce, bounce)
Rock, skate (rock, rock, skate, skate)
Roll, bounce (roll, roll, bounce, bounce)
Rock, skate (rock, rock, skate, skate)
Roll, bounce (roll, roll, bounce, bounce)
Rock, skate (rock, rock, skate, skate)
Roll, bounce (roll, roll, bounce)
Rock, skate (ska-a-a-a-ate)
Roll, bounce (bounce)
Rock, skate (oh, you're looking so good)
Roll, bounce (bounce)
Rock, skateEmbed
