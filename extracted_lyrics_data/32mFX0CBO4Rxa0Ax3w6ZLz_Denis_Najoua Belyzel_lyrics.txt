1 ContributorDenis LyricsDenis
Tell me what's in your head
I want to know what's going wrong
I need to understand
You treat me bad
You drag me down, down
Darling, you behave like a creep
I want your love right now
Return to me, don't let me down
I need you by my side
My love for you is strong enough
To never say good-bye
'Cause Denis you're the one who touched my heart
Who touched my soul
But I don't want to let you go
Away from me, I'll miss you so
That's why I don't want you to go
Denis, don't go, Denis
Denis, you know you better stop
The little pills you used to take
Before you go insane
And because I know you're just a man
I'll forgive you if you're lying, so promise me again
Return to me, don't let me down
I need you by my side
My love for you is strong enough to never say good-bye
You might also like'Cause Denis you're the one who touched my heart
Who touched my soul
But I don't want to let you go
Away from me, I'll miss you so
That's why I don't want you to go
Denis, don't go, Denis
Denis, don't go, Denis
Listen to me
'Cause Denis you're the one who touched my heart
Who touched my soul
But I don't want to let you go
Away from me, I'll miss you so
That's why I don't want you to go
Denis, don't go, Denis
Denis, don't go, Denis
Denis, Denis, Denis, Denis, Denis
Denis, Denis, Denis, Denis, Denis
Denis, Denis, Denis, Denis, Denis
Denis, Denis, Denis, Denis, Denis
