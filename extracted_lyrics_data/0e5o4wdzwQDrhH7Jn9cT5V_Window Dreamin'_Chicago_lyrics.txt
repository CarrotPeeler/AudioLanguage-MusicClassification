5 ContributorsWindow Dreaminâ€™ Lyrics
Hey hey hey yeah

Looking out by my window, now
Thinking about you all the time
Wish you were here with me
Right here by my side

Because I'm window, window dreaming
Because I'm window, window dreaming

Every time I find myself on the road
Miss you holding me tight
Flop down in my easy chair
Makes me feel alright

Because I'm window, window dreaming
Because I'm window, window dreaming, oh

Gigs are fun
When they're done
Feel so down
Act like a clown
Company's great
But when it's late
I'm looking for the phone
I feel so alone, so alone
You might also like
Knowing the way we both feel
O know you're always gonna be my friend
Dig, your face, Lord, it's real
Someday I'm never going to go again

Because I'm window, window dreaming
Because I'm window, window dreaming, oh

Gigs are fun
When they're done
Feel so down
Act like a clown
Company's great
But when it's late
I'm looking for the phone
I feel so alone, so alone

Window dreaming
Window dreaming, uh huhEmbed
