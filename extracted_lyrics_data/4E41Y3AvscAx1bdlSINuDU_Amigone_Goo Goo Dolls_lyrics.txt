Everytime you point your finger
Three more point right back at you
I'm not saying that there's something wrong with life
Cause that's a sad excuse

An age old game of rat and mouse
Is chasing us from house to house
I'm not saying that there's something wrong with you
It's wrong with me as well

Are you alive?
Amigone
(Miracles gone wrong)
Is it too late to call and tell you to be strong?
Are you alive?
Amigone
(Miracles gone wrong)
Was the poison in our blood there all along?
Amigone

Heavenly intoxication
Love's been marred by medication
Ain't it funny how a life can take a turn
When the end is near

Are you alive?
Amigone
(Miracles gone wrong)
Is it too late to call and tell you to be strong?
Are you alive?
Amigone
(Miracles gone wrong)
Is it too late to face the truth that it was wrong?
Amigone

I'm not saying that it's nothing
I ain't gonna play along
I ain't wishing for a miracle
That miracle's gone wrong
And you're too strong

Amigone
(Miracles gone wrong)
Is it too late to call and tell you to be strong?
Are you alive?
Amigone
(Is it wrong?)
Was the poison in our blood there all along?
Are you alive?
Amigone
(Miracles gone wrong)
Is it too late to call and tell you to be strong?
Are you alive?
Amigone
(Is it wrong?)
Was the poison in our blood there all along?
