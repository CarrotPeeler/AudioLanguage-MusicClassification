1 ContributorWorld1Day / Drown n n n LyricsPart 1: "World1Day"
Intro: JRetta
'Cause if I got God and my dreams on my side, I'll go anywhere (I'll go anywhere)
And of course there'll be people who don't believe, but who gives a fuck anyway ? (Gives a fuck anyway)
You see this life is mine
God by my side
And failure's not an option so we wave goodbye
And so we just get high
So we can get closer to the sky
These hopes and dreams are mine, soul's fine, listen up...
Chorus: JRetta
And I'ma take over the world one day
I'ma take over the world one day
(Na na na)
I'ma take over the world one day
I'ma take over the world one day
(Na na na)
And I'ma take all'a your girls one day
I'ma take all'a your girls one day
(Na na na)
But first I gotta take over the world one day
Gotta take over the world one day
I believe in me, I believe in me
(God, friends, family, and love) x2
I believe in me, I believe in me
(Mind, heart, body, and soul) x2
Verse: JRetta
I'm just a young Black boy trying to dream
Life's a nightmare, I never scream
'Cause I taught myself not to fear if I got, God on my team
What I mean, is your fears don't scare you if you're a fiend
Man it's funny the broken ones always craving for a fix
And that's that lean
That's that potent drug when you feeling weak
You're made of steel
You don't need potent drugs to help you heal
Hear me speak, man these verses are holy so hear me preach
I'm just lucky I get to rap about all the pain I feel
Go on and kneel
And ask God to guide you
And while you're on your journey, work hard to find you
Accept that you will fail, that's life, the cycle
And when they say you're bright, don't let your vanity blind you (blind you)
Don't ever focus on what's behind you
And know a couple of things in life will be beyond you
And know you're not alone, man just look beside you
Just dream big, work harder, and your dreams will find you, find you
(Find you)

Bridge: JRetta
Is your soul even really at peace ?
Don't mean you're living if you hear your heart...beat
(And that's real)
So work hard, and follow your dreams
See you can make it if you just believe
(Just believe)
Verse: JRetta
So don't be discouraged by failure
It's the losses that make ya
Shout out to Grandmama, she taught me the power of prayer
Don't be hungry for favours
Don't be thirsty for paper
And don't procrastinate. and don't pay no mind to the haters

Pre-Hook: JRetta
'Cause we grind, we shine, your mind's your biggest weapon
Be nice, and find your fire and keep it burning
In time, ignite your light and wait your turn
Live right, you'll be fine, don't be afraid to learn
Chorus: JRetta
And I'ma take over the world one day
I'ma take over the world one day
(Na na na)
I'ma take over the world one day
I'ma take over the world one day
(Na na na)
And I'ma take all'a your girls one day
I'ma take all'a your girls one day
(Na na na)
But first I gotta take over the world one day
Gotta take over the world one day
I believe in me, I believe in me
(God, friends, family, and love) x2
I believe in me, I believe in me
(Mind, heart, body, and soul) x2
Part 2: "Drown n n n"
Intro Verse: JRetta
Your last man did you wrong, so I write this song
To tell you, you ain't gotta worry 'bout finding your home
So I open my door, and you find me alone
And I won't ever press ignore when you call for my soul
So tears fall while you listening to, 'Cry Me A River'
Puddles form, I just hope that you don't, drown in your bitter
'Cause I promise girl i'm better, I will never let you down
While I resuscitate your heart, 'cause I will never let you drown
Chorus: JRetta
I'll never let you drown
I'll never let you drown
I'll never let you drown, baby
I'll never let you down
I'll never let you down
I'll never let you down, baby
I'll never let you drown
I'll never let you down
Verse: JRetta
Don't let the past get the best of you, it bettered you
See that was just an interlude
I get a peek at you, I just stare at you, you're beautiful
You feel invisible, funny, I only see myself with you
So feel invincible, let's just wing it, I'll only fly with you
Amazing, ain't it? Here's a chance, I pray you take it
You were always in the picture, all I had to do was paint it
And, maybe I'm crazy, but I don't care what they're saying
Only time I feel at home is when I hear you say you're staying
Girl you so beautiful, I hope you know I mean it
Your love has rocked my world, I can't shake this funny feeling
Promise you won't give up, I will always hold you down
I lick your other tongue, your water falls, I'll never let you drown
Chorus: JRetta
I'll never let you drown
I'll never let you drown
I'll never let you drown, baby
I'll never let you down
I'll never let you down
I'll never let you down, baby
I'll never let you drown
I'll never let you downEmbed
