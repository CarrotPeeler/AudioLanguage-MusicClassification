5 ContributorsHaunts of Ancient Peace Lyrics
Beside the garden walls
We walk in haunts of ancient peace
At night we rest and go to sleep
In haunts of ancient peace

The love and light we seek
The words we do not need to speak
Here in this wondrous way we keep
These haunts of ancient peace

Let us go there again
Oh, when we need some relief
Oh, when I, I can't find my feet
When I need rest and sleep

The Sunday bells they chime
Around the countryside and towns
A song of harmony and rhyme
In haunts of ancient peace (Alright)

You might also like
The holy grail we seek
On down by haunts of ancient peace
We see the new Jerusalem
In haunts of ancient peace
(I'll sing a solo)

Oh, when I can't find my feet (Yeah)
Oh, when I need, I need some relief
I'm gonna go there one more time again
You know I want to go there one more time again
Be still in haunts of ancient peace
Be stillEmbed
