If only I could your mind love
If you could read my mind love, what a tale my thoughts could tell
Just like an old time movie 'bout a ghost from a wishing well
In a castle dark or a fortress strong with chains upon my feet
You know that ghost is me
And I will never be set free as long as I'm a ghost that you can't see
(If only)
If I could read your mind love, what a tale your thoughts could tell
Just like a paperback novel, the kind the drugstores sell
And when you reached the part where the heartaches come, the heroin would be me
But heroins often fail
And you won't read that book again because the ending's just too hard to take
(If only I could your mind love)
(If only I could your mind love)
I'd walk away like a movie star who gets burned in a three way script
And enter number two
A movie king to play the scene of bringing all the good things out in me
But for now love, let's be real
I never thought I could feel this way and I've got to say that I just don't get it
I don't know where we went wrong but the feeling's gone and I just can't get it back
Ooh baby
(If only, if only you could my mind love)
(If only, if only I could your mind love)
Ooh baby, you see
I'd walk away like a movie star who gets burned in a three way script
And enter number two
A movie king to play the scene of bringing all the good things out in me
But now, let's be real
I never thought I could feel this way and I've got to say, I just don't get it
I don't know where we went wrong but the feeling's gone and I just can't get it back
(If only, if only, if only I could your mind love)
(If only, if only, if only I could your mind love) If I could red your mnd
(If only, if only, if only I could your mind love) Ooh, what a tale your thoughts could tell
(If only, if only, if only I could your mind love) Come on baby, come on baby, won't you let me read your mind
(If only, if only, if only I could your mind love) Wanna read, read your mind
(If only, if only, if only I could your mind love)You might also likeEmbed
