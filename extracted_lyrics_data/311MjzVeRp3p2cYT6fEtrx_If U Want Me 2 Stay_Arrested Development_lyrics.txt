3 ContributorsWORK FOR ALEISTER CROWLEY Lyrics{JUV3Y}
All salute
KirbLaGoop
Got respect for OGs
Heard they was planning coupe
Can't recoup, trigger squeeze
You on blocks, bitch please
You on Roblox
Me and the gang causing roadblocks
Gra Gra (Wet)
Don't you ever ask me for a fucking front (Never)
Bitch the shit I'm smokin on ain't a fucking blunt
Yeah I think it Motocross, the way i stunt(Stunt)
Arrested Development, the way my brain stunted
Capn' Crunch
Got a buncha hoes
Sailin' in a boat
It got buncha holes
Purple drank got me movin slo-mo
Got refills from the doc, so I'm bout to pop mo
It's a shock, when they see my mouth filled to top with that foam
Went to WalMart with mask, just to get a trap phone
Feds got that wiretap
Honeypot still hittin' that
Fuck act quick, equip the gat
Tell me Kirb, what you think bout' dat?

Woadie I boom

Woadie you
You know who i am in the game
Im be zoomin
Been boomin
Mister Goop
I am the truest (i'm the truest)

I got prada designer sneakers while im covered in stains
Heavy metal in my jacket i got black tar in my veins
Me juvey n kirb be smoking on toxins like propane
Lace the blunt with pcp and then take it str8 2 the face
Body in the trunk catch me swervin  str8 off the backroads
Lights up in the sky are blinking my full name in morse code
Lookin out the window waiting 4 the feds 2 storm im my home
Everything comes with a price  struck a deal at the crossroads
Pseudo get the bag by any fuckin means
Feel like walter white im sellin packs they weighin down my jeans
Fuck the world if u dont got my money stompin out a fiend
I aunt no charity im tryna make my neck gleam
You know we b countin we b countin hella dough
We stay tweakin u know we b snortin hella blow
Run thru 3 packs inna a day im smokin ciggies 2 the dome
Fuck my life we be tweaking off that AdrenochromeEmbed
