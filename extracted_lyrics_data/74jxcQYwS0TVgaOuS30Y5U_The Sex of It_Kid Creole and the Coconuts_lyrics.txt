1 ContributorThe Sex of It Lyrics
You say you want simplicity
You don't like love complex
I got a spooky feeling
You just want me for the sex

The thrills of it
The chills of it
The spills of it
You just want me for the sex
The sex of it
The sex of it

I gave for a diamond ring, my friend
That didn't get for off
French cologne a hundred bucks an ounce
(Ooh)
All you did was cough
You say you want simplicity
You don't like love complex
But I got a spooky feeling
You just want me for the sex

The thrills of it
The chills of it
The spills of it
Baby, baby, you just want me for the sex
Just want me for the sex
The sex of it
The sex of it
You might also like
Uh, excuse me darling, but uh, do you think you could put some clothes on?
The sex of it
The sex of it

How can I make you understand that's all I wanna do?
Damn my life, I'd rather spend it all with you
I couldn't love you anymore, I guess I'll hate you next
Confess you witch!
(What?)
You just want me for my sex

The thrills of it
The chills of it
The spills of it
You just want me for the sex
The thrills of it
The chills of it
The spills of it
You just want me for the sex

The sex of it
The sex of it
Excuse me, darling, do you think it's possible that you could cover your outer extremities?
Because I am expecting some people to come over to the house
The sex of it
The sex of it
The sex of it
The sex of itEmbed
