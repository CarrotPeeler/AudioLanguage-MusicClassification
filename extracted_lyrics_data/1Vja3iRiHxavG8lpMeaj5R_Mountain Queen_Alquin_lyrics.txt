2 ContributorsLiving Proof Lyrics
Its Paydae nigga!

I can't do no wrong
I've been killin' these clowns
Im not even a rapper
I sing on my songs
Got a lot of things to say
But you better pray
'cause I just came for the crown (whoa)
You ain't really poppin'
You bittin' all my shit and all the things that I'm rocking
Triple X-L we do it big, we the truth
I've been running this shit boy I'm living proof
5 years and countin' they don't credit me for shit
But I'm at the top of this mountain
Don't really give a fuck I y'all get it or nah
From the bottom to the top Ima get it like that
Yous a clown in the game they've been gassin your shit
But it's not a big deal to me, este canario no pierde
Sin copiarme de Drake siempre original, lo sabe hasta tu baby
*Bridge*
35109 Southside we gon' get it (Southside)
Young dropout but I'm the boy with the clout
Ima always gon' get it like whoooa
They up in my phone, hating on the low
No se ni pa' que vienen, quien gana aquí soy yo
You might also like
I am the truth, Im living proof
They know I got it, they know I
I'm bullshit proof, I'm living proof
I'm living proof

Stacking the amount, you creepin' around
What the fuck is you talking about?
I ain't gotta do much just to prove my talent
I'm sure I'm gon die rich
You probably mad cause I fucked yo bitch
My shit on fleek, you still ain't shit
Been gettin' shit on my own, still in my zone
Gotta get it that dough, I'm ill (The G.O.A.T.)
Still fucking all of these hoes, got a million dollar plan
And I ain't even move dope
Yeah thats how we living, don't ask me for no favors
I don't feel like giving
Shout out Live Illegal from the 305
Lil' Henny on my cup thats how we ride
Y'all rappers ain't sellin'
My rhymes are so hard Im Dae-K47 (Like BANG)
I run all this market
Este Canario se queda con tó y no reparte
I'm a young player from the south headed to the top
All I need is money, all I know is cash
35109 Southside we gon' get it (Southside)
Young dropout but I'm the boy with the clout
Ima always gon' get it like whoooa
They up in my phone, hating on the low
No se ni pa' que vienen, quien gana aquí soy yo

I am the truth, Im living proof
They know I got it, they know I
I'm bullshit proof, I'm living proof
I'm living proof
I'm living proof
Fuck your favorite rapperEmbed
