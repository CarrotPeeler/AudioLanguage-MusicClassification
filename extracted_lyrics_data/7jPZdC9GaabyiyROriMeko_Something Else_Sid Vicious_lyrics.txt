4 ContributorsSomething Else LyricsLook at that
Here she comes
Here comes that girl again
One of the cutest since I don't know when
But she don't notice me when I pass
She goes with all the guys from outta my class
But that can't stop me from thinkin' to myself
"She's sure fine lookin', man, she's something else"
Look at that
'Cross the street
There's a car built just for me
To own a car would be a luxury
But right now I can't afford the gas
A brand new convertible is out of my class
But that can't stop me from thinkin' to myself
"That car's fine lookin', man, it's something else"
Hey, look at that
Just wait and see
Worked hard and saved my dough
I buy that car and then I roll up with Joe
Get me that girl and we go ridin' around
We look real sharp with the wide top down
I keep on dreamin' and thinkin' to myself
"When it all comes true, man, well that's something else"

Watch out this
Never thought I'd do this before
But here I am a-knockin' on her door
My car's out front and it's all mine
It's a '41 job not a '59
I got that girl and I'm thinkin' to myself
"She's sure fine lookin', man, well she's something else"1Embed
