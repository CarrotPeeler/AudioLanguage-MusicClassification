Gonna leave Fort Worth, Texas and go to Texarkana
And double back to Fort Worth
Come on down to Dallas, change cars on the Katy
Coming through the Territory to Kansas City
And from Kansas City to St. Louis, St. Louis to Chicago
I'm on my way but I don't know where

Change cars on the TP
Leaving Fort Worth, Texas, going through Dallas
Hello, Terrell, Grand Saline, Silver Lake, Mineola
Tyler, Longview, Jefferson, Marshall, Little Sandy, Big Sandy
Texarkana and double back to Fort Worth

Change cars on the Katy
Leaving Dallas, Texas, going through Rockwall
Hello Greenville, Celeste, Denison, South McAlester
Territory, Muskogee, Wagner, Parsons, Kansas
Kansas City, Sedalia, then I change cars and jump into St Louis

Hello Springfield, I'm on my way, Chicago
Bloomington
Joliet
Can the High Boiler pass on through?
High Boiler on through, sir
