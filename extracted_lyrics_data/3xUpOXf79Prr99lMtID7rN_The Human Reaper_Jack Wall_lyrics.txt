6 ContributorsResident Evil Rap Cypher Lyrics
Slash, get checked by the blade
It's not a homie when it's zombies, catch a tech to the face
I'm way more than player one, I'm the best in the game
I punch boulders using strength, I'll kill Wesker today
Mess with, Claire or Jill, I'll leave the scene, like my last name
B.O.W., say bow when the gat sprays
Bazooka to a Tyrant, I saved the day in the first game
Marvel vs Capcom 3, I got the best aim

I got the antibodies, these hands are for any body
Alive or undead pop off, I'm poppin off the semi Audi
Petty shawty, fine ass downin' twenty zombies
Ain't afraid to "buck", so I'm sluggin' with the shotty
Jill Valentine, pocket checking every friend of mine
You wanna drop bombs, well I keep the fuckin' time
Highest tier, still in my prime, try n' test me, best rewind
And tell that mother fucker Wesker, I'mma take his fuckin' spine

Albert Wesker, I'll confess I'm
Not really one to be down with lectures
Power flexer, now surrender
Relieve that pain like Alka-Seltzer
Scouted member, found by Spencer
'Bout to make them all bow with pressure
Now your left without a head
Profound and the best, these louts are lesser
I run this shit, captain, leader, tyrant, call me all them
The human race is pathetic, this strain's a cure for boredom
No more games, you'll be extinct like the Mastodon
It's all shade when this boss, puts his glasses on
You might also like
No Steakfries, yet Barry catching air
And ya know I got a clip or two to spare
Nah, you'll be the one who's scared
When you catch a round from me, in my underwear
Leave you red cuz I'm invested, so you'll also be disarmed
Right to the nose like you're congested, I guess I'll leave you seeing S.T.A.R.S
Let me take care of this, unload the mag like a newsstand
And I did help beat Nemesis, don't care if it ain't cannon man
B.S. double A., like your lies were charged, and I'm rapping it up like a bandage
Raise the roof, and drop it hot like, it was almost a "Jill Sandwich"

Don't leech on me, if you're not prepared
I've seen more shit, that I don't need to share
Don't overlook me because my young age
You won't make it farm, without my brains
Defeating these beasts, that's my analysis
Not scared of this virus, I'm getting out of it
Put on the case by S.T.A.R.S., I'm dodging death
Officer Chambers at your service

It's the kid surviving death row, and then you're next bro
Lieutenant on the scene, fulfilling missions, loaded, let's go
I ain't taking out the innocents, marine down, to my hardened core
Ain't part of the participants, get more than what you bargained for
Simply a survivor, the stars got my back
The king, I'm the provider, damn this world is out of wack
See me handling my business, cause the fire still be burning
I'm the madman in the shadows, so who knows if I'm returning
What up, Claire? Time to get out of here
My first day on the job, and it's filled with fear
But together we will survive, and then proceed
As we avoid Mr. X in the RPD
Raccoon City I'm stuck, like I'm caught in the snow
A zombie run up, I'mma bag him, no grocery store
Even though I'm a rookie, I shoot like a pro
You like me in the 2nd game? Shoulda seen me in 4

Who's near? Don't shoot I'm human!
Don't keep on with what you're doin
With my skills I make 'em lose it
No, don't got the time for screwin'
Around the time is tickin', hitting crits, I never miss
See the mastery of aimin', don't believe?
I'll make it lit, like the factory
Fight or flight it ain't an option
Human race ain't up for auction
Won't be prey with predators watchin
Me and Leon won't be in a coffin
Don't trust you, and the heart you crossin
One wrong move? My aim is locked in
Shot taken, on point your skull's crushed in
Guns up in the red dress, blood won't even leave a mark
Bullets make a red field, guess they would be seeing S.T.A.R.S
I bear arms with bare arms, and stop their beating hearts
I keep my next move hidden, like a secret art
Undercover, sneak beneath umbrella
I misdirected Mr. X, and got to know Leon better
G-Virus, get it and jet
I'm the highest level of threat
To these biters, getting that lead
I'll send them over the edge like Annette

Call me Mr. Reaper, I'm bringing death to all the mutant people
Staying calm collective, more perceptive all my shots are lethal
Switching guns like GTA, I might just stab you with a shank
Maneuver through the sewers, when the mission's done, I get hazard pay
Umbrella forces know to call me, but I'm not here for the rain
William probably think he got away, the job was done that day
Death cannot die, but I can make you live your life in vain
So please don't make yourself a target
Your life is nothing if I'm marching

The big homie in the trenches, breaking down defenses
Call me 103, that's to a T, don't ever mention
Me you got a problem, motherfucker, we can end this
Taking hella ish, you better come right to ya senses
The best man, not Undertaker, but a Deadman
Virus I'ma G, you getting left like you was less than
Breaking down the wall, about to make a mess
And better run for cover, when onslaught like a X-Man

Ok now this is my moment
I'll save these people from rodents
The undead lurking and roaming
But my shots quick and they potent
Enemies see my Glock, and I see they fear when I cock it
Unless they dead and brainless, then I blow they flesh on the pavement
I'm a combat exceller, I'm swiftly palming Beretta's
It's raining blood when I hit ya, you better grab an umbrella
No bite is piercing through this, now see I won't even miss
Adios puta, watch me as I'm draining the clip

Walk up in the spot, in the field, call me Nemesis
If you think you ill, I'mma show you where the metal is
Busting through your walls, on god, we gonna settle this
Your head around my neck, gon have me looking like a medalist
I'm a living terror threat, you better get out of my way
You can get the whole army, that don't mean that you're safe
If they ever come at me, they don't just leave with some scars
Nah I send them right to heaven, up to hang with the stars

Might be short, but like this list, know that I'm stacked
Dead men tell no tales, Salazar is on attack
I'm a prophet not a hobbit, had enough, of that
I'm a cultist, the result is, you're about to get smacked
8th in the line, last one to make claim
Be the last time, that you see this face
This Castellan, will cast a hand, a cultist but I don't cultivate
Aim is the US president, means you're my enemy
Shouldn't be a shock, I tried to kill off a Kennedy

Sheva with the shiv, but I'm deadly with the grip
A fighter 'til the end, how I grew up as a kid
I let the bullets rain, not a chance for an umbrella
Good with instruments, but I'll chop them up, acapella
Don't think I'm role-playing, with that RPG-7
Ain't a game boy, sins will send you to hell or heaven
Welcome to Africa, this ain't a comedy or romance
A tragedy, but loyalty will decide this slim chance

Not a regular day in the Baker's residence
Put the evil on a display, and I'm feeling hesitant
Welcome to the family, it's menacing just like Nemesis
Looking for some answers, with nothing but my adrenaline
I am only here because my girl is M.I.A., yuh
The secrets running deeper, this was due to child's play, yuh
Is there a birthday party, man I don't know jack
I thank the stars, but I don't really need a zodiac

Eveline, Eveline, devil is revelin'
Why couldn't you stay away
I'm filled with adrenaline, for Ethan endless endeavors in
Trying to see a new day
From the Annabelle, our tale I'll tell, of "gifts" that you're giving us all
Weave a spell into the hell, you've molded making me enthralled
Swimming in the maze, that you have made with my head
I fight through it to warn him, now that daddy's comin

Welcome to the family, son, come in and take a seat
You look famished, but you panic, cause we made you something to eat?
Like I'm the head of the Bakers, of, don't you mind the mold
Dammit woman! What're you doin? Now these hearts are too cold
Don't you run away, it's fun to play, with us, so don't you want to stay?
You won't escape, cause once you take, a step outside, the swamp thing will know
My head won't straighten, regeneration, so take you weapon and aim it
What're you sayin? Nothing you idiot, cause you get locked in the basementEmbed
