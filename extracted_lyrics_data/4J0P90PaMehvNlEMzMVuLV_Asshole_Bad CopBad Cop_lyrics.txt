3 ContributorsAsshole Lyrics
Well, I see you got yourself a little haircut
You look like an asshole, at least to me
Good to see that you've been flyin' your true colors these days
These days

The only things I want back from you
Are my time and my bass guitar (Hey, fuck you!)
Other than that, I'm satisfied to see you walk around
Lookin' like the asshole I know you are

Well, I know that you've been fuckin' my friend Dani
Not much of a friend, but a pretty good lay, I heard
And if you two weren't such a perfect pair of jackoffs, I might feel bad
Take it the wrong way

The only things I want back from you
Are my time and my bass guitar (Hey, fuck you!)
Other than that, I'm satisfied to see you walk around
Lookin' like the asshole I know you are
Lookin' like the asshole I know you are
Lookin' like the asshole I know you areYou might also likeEmbed
