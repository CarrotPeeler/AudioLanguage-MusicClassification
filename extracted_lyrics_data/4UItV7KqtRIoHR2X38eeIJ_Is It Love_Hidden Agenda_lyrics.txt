2 ContributorsBurners & Bust Downs Lyrics
It's never enough
You gotta keep goin'
That energy don't cease to exist
It goes through reforming
Rainy nights symbolize the pain the world hold dormant
Many lies that separate our minds
We need a new doorman
Open up a glitch and see the truth
Don't put no noose on it
Once you face a problem at its root, could grow to new stories
Always think it through
Got shit to lose, them days are few on us
Tune into the news homie
You could learn a lot if you sit back and let me teach ya
Came up from the bottom
On my way up, fought some demons
Yusuke, I red dot 'em
And I spray 'em when I see 'em
Steady schemin' just like Ross
But I was trained to slay like Hiei
The game we play like relay
Ain't focus on that he say
My eyes on the vault and I unlock it like a young Aang
A nigga got sick and tired of walkin'
Now I run things
I hit the block, tell 'em what it costs
And then it's "cha-ching"
In any circumstance don't take your chances
Or we on your head like dandruff
Throw a tantrum with the Glock
If your aura unbalanced, it's apparent
There's a hidden agenda, still not fearin'
I work better when my back to the wall
No one near me, uh
I follow my gut and shit feel weird like I had dairy, uh
Some might call it luck, but I know that my angels hear me, uh
Is it love or lust? Who can I trust? Somebody tell me
But that person be yourself
Learn to love you on the daily, uh
Had to take a pause, let it breathe
Got the tendency to always spill the sauce when I eat
Got bad memory, but I remember y'all didn't believe
It's funny when the tables turn and now your plate is underneath, uh
Some switched sides, no hard feelings
Just don't hit me when shit get realer, uh
Take that to heart if it sound familiar
Took my kindness for my weakness
But ain't know I was a killer
If they come and get me, middle finger on my way out
'Til the day I'm gone, man this Earth gon' be my playground
Take a hit and zone, I'm on my goals soon as I touch down
Never leave my home without the burner and a bust downYou might also likeEmbed
