7 ContributorsDo What You Do Lyrics
When you say the things you say
You got to mean it
And when you do the things you do
It's gotta come from the heart

Something's gone, I can't explain
The heat is missing from the flame
Can't deny it, there's a link missing from the chain, uh-huh
There's something wrong with you and me
When one and one adds up to three
Don't know the reason, but the fact is plain to see, uh-huh

It's the touch that you lose, and the words you don't say
It's the love you refuse, don't you throw it away

When you do what you do that like you to me
Don't you know that it ain't enough
When you do what you do it don't mean a thing
When you do what you do without love
Without love

I'm gonna paint a picture of you
The only color I need is blue
You're out of love, baby you know it's true, uh-huh
You might also like
Tell me why and I'll try to understand

'Cause I could cry when you do what you do to me
Don't you know that it ain't enough
When you do what you do it don't mean a thing
When you do what you do without love, ah


It's the touch that you lose, and the words you don't say
It's the love you refuse, don't you throw it away

When you do what you do that like you to me
Don't you know that it ain't enough
When you do what you do it don't mean a thing
When you do what you do without love
Without love

When you do what you it don't mean a thing
(Don't mean a thing, do, got to do it with love)
When you do what you it don't mean a thing
(Don't mean a thing, do, got to do it with love)
When you do what you it don't mean a thing
(Don't mean a thing, do, got to do it with love)Embed
