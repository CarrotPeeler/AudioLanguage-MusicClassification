3 ContributorsOn and On LyricsBy now you think it's over
Countdown it's getting colder
Come on - tell me it's over
It goes on and on and on and on again
Tell me everything this time
I'll tell you everything is fine
Give me something I already know
I heard you had too much inside
And you won't let me ask you why
Come on let me tell you all we know
Someone tell me that I'm right
Tell me it's too late tonight
Tell me that I have a ways to go
I can see it in your eyes
I don't want the next surprise
Come on let me tell you all we knowYou might also likeEmbed
