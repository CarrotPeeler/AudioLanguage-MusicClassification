1 ContributorI’m Gonna Stop You From Givin’ Me the Blues Lyrics
You know I tried to treat you right
But you stayed out all night
Keep telling me, oh it ain’t my business
What you’re doing with your line
But I did some searching for myself
And I found out you’ve been sleeping with someone else
You know it feels so bad being accused
And I’m gonna stop you from givin’ me the blues

I gave you money, brought you a brand new car
But I’m only human, a man can only go so far
You see there’s so many women in the streets from which to choose
So I’m gonna stop you from givin’ me the blues

You see I did some searching in my mind
And I found out I’ve been wasting my time
Cos there’s so many women in the streets from which to choose
And I’m gonna stop you from givin’ me the blues

Cos ain’t nobody’s perfect on this god’s earth
I tried to do my best, I thought it would work
When you come home
Smelling like some other man’s cologne
It’d take a fool not to know
What’s been goin’ on
You might also like
I did some thinking late last night
I don’t wanna holler, I ain’t gon’ fuss and fight
Cos there’s so many women in the streets from which to choose
I’m gonna stop you from givin’ me the blues

Cos ain’t nobody’s perfect on this god’s earth
But.I tried to do my best, I thought it would work
But when you come home
Smelling like some other man’s cologne
It’d take a fool not to know
What’s been goin’ on

I did some thinking late last night
I don’t wanna holler, I ain’t gon’ fuss and fight
Cos there’s so many women in the streets from which to choose
I’m gonna stop you from givin’ me the blues

Cos there’s so many women out there from which to choose
I’m gonna stop you from givin’ me the blues
Cos there’s so many women in the streets from which to choose…Embed
