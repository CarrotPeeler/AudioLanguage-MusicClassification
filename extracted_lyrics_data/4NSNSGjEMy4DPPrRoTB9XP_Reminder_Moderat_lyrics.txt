16 ContributorsReminder LyricsI steal from the beggar's empty plate
And give to the fat man
I dance in the halls of the newly insane
And pray to a god that is vacant again
Dark is the shadow
Filled with prejudice no pride
Worn out unwelcome
His truth birthing lies
A whisper now speaks
What words used to say
Fallen from grace
Luster this way
(Burning)
Burning bridges light my way
Burning bridges light my way
(Burning bridges light my..)
And while the rain keeps coming down
A rope of hope's too thin to climb
The night is closing in
We're down the bottom of the well
(Burning)
Burning bridges light my way
Burning bridges light my way
Burning bridges light my way
(Burning)
Burning bridges light my way
(Burning bridges light my..)

(Ohh)
Burning bridges light my way
(Ohh)(Burning)
