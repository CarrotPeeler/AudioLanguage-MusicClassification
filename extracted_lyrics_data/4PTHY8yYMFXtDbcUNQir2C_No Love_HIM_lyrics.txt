3 ContributorsNo Love Lyrics
Forever and ever

Shadows grow taller
And I'm sleeping off my scars
Lonely, I hold her
And crave for your warmth
And it hurts hard

There's no love
No love will be enough
For what I'm feeling
No love
No love will be the end
Of this dreaming of you

Hell is freezing over
And the light is long gone
And I wonder where you are

There's no love
No love will be enough
For what I'm feeling
No love
No love will be the end
Of this dreaming of you
You might also like
We're the stars
In the drama of the flame
Making love to the rain

There's no love
No love will be enough
For what I'm feeling
No love
No love will be the end
Of this dreaming of you
This dreaming of you
Forever and everEmbed
