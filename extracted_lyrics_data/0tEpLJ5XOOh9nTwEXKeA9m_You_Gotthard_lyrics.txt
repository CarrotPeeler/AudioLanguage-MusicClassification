1 ContributorLooking At You Lyrics
In all the games I've played
It seems the dice were always wrong
Never stood a chance, and I know
But I found a love so good
That I wanna hold it
It's something that I'll have to see through

Looking at you, looking at me
What a solid gold love, this could be
Something that I'll never know
Looking at you, looking at me
I see a bird of love, to set me free
We can make it, on our own

I came up the hard way
Just alive on one night stands
I was never looking for another kind
And I'll bet you one night
Ooh, when we were holding hands
I knew that I've found my peace of mind

So don't let me wait too long
Cuz' I can't live another day without your love
I need to know baby...

Looking at you, looking at me
What a solid gold love, this could be
Something that I'll never know
Looking at you, looking at me
I see a bird of love, to set me free
We can make it, on our own

Looking at you, looking at me
What a solid gold love, this could be
Something that I'll never know
Looking at you, looking at me
I see a bird of love, to set me free
We can make it, on our ownEmbed
