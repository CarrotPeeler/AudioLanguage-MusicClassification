2 ContributorsNever Go Back LyricsMake space
I can't breath for the smell of fear
I had a vision of the future
And the future
Wasn't there...
Erase
Everything that you thought you knew
I had a dream
A dream about the future and I wasn't there
Neither were you
You can never go back
Never go back
You can never go back
No home
Wear your failure like a brand new badge
No soul
No right to a soul
Pick the bones clean
No hope
Wear your failure like a shiny new pin
No soul
No right to a soul
Pick the bones clean
You might also likeYou can never go back
Never go back
You can never go back
Make space
I can't breath for the smell of fear
Make space
I can't breath for the smell of fear
Make space
I can't breath for the smell of fear
Make space
I can't breath for the smell of fear
I had a dream about the future
And the future wasn't there
And neither were you...
You can never go backEmbed
