2 ContributorsBite The Bullet/The Chase Is Better Than The Catch  LyricsStepping out, I'm leaving here
No use crying, crying in my beer
Enough's enough, believe it's true
Bite The Bullet, I'm leaving you
Said goodbye, I left a note
But I don't remember, just what I wrote
The same old words, to say we're through
Bite The Bullet, I'm leaving you
So that's the way it always ends
Get sympathy from all your friends
Seems there's nothing, nothing else to do
Bite The Bullet, I'm leaving you

You know I'm bad, the times I've had
I've got a bad reputation
I don't care, I get my share
Don't feel no deprivation
The more I get the better it is
I like it fine, like a little whizz
Treat 'em like ladies, that's a fact
You know The Chase Is Better Than The Catch
You might also like
Silver-tongued devil, demon lech
You know just what I'm doing
I like a little innocent b****
You know I ain't just s*******
I love you baby, love you too much
I like it fine, I feel your touch
But your appearance don't hold no class
You know The Chase Is Better Than The Catch
A little beauty, I love you madly
Come on home with me
I know you're hot, I know what you've got
You know I want to shake your tree
Come on honey, touch me right there
Come on honey, don't you get scared
Come on honey, let me get you in the sack
You know The Chase Is Better Than The Catch
All right! Let me hear ya!
I can't hear ya!Embed
