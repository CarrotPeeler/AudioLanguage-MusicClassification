4 ContributorsYour Eyes Lyrics
I wanna look into your eyes again
I wanna look into the windows of your soul
Again, again

Who's to know where time will lead us now?
I can't believe this is happening now
I'm not scared, I'm just wondering how
I wanna see your eyes
All the time we've shared between us now
The feeling I have needs me to make a vow
Now as I leave I must return somehow
Cause I wanna see your eyes

I wanna look into your eyes again
I wanna look into the window of your soul

When I look at you I fumble
My confidence takes a tumble
But when I look into your eyes, I just crumble
'Cause I know that it's you that my heart burns for
That it's you that I'm yearning for

I wanna look into your eyes again
I wanna look into the window of your soul
Look into your eyes again
Look into your eyes again
Look into your eyes again
Look into your eyes again
Look into your eyes again

Who's to know where time will lead us now
I can't believe this is happening now
Well I'm not scared, I'm just wondering how
I wanna see your eyes, I wanna make it right

I wanna look into your eyes again
I wanna look into the window of your soul
Again, again
Look into your eyes
Look into your eyesEmbed
