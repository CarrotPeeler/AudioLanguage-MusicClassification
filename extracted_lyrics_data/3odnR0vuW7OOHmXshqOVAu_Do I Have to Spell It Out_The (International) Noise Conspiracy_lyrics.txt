Hey I've got just one little thing to say
I've got a little secret if you want to come my way
Do I have to spell it out?
Yeah I've got you under my thumb
I've got my desires free to grab for everyone
'Cause you know that I wanted you
So please be careful with the words you choose
There is so much that we can do
Yeah I wanted you to be by my side
Everyone in here all of the time
Do I have to spell it out?
And you know that I always wanted you
And you know there is so much that we can do
And you know something about the words we choose
And if you ever think about loving
Please consider me
Yeah I've got just a little thing to say
An insurrection, a new direction coming our way
Do I have to spell it out?
And you know that I always wanted to be with you
And you know that together were no fools
And you know there is nothing that we can't do
And if you ever think about lovingYou might also likeEmbed
