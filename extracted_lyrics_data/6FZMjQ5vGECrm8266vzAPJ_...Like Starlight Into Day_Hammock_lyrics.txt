1 Contributor...Like Starlight into Day LyricsYou say your time is over
You seek but never find
And the cold wind on your shoulder
A storm inside your mind
You say you’re tired of waiting
You’re weak and so ashamed
And your faith is finally fading
Like starlight into day...
So you throw yourself away
No more time for waiting
So you throw yourself away
You threw yourself away
You threw yourself awayYou might also likeEmbed
