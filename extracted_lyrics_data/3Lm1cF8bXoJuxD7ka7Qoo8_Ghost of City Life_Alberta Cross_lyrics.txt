1 ContributorGhost of City Life LyricsHow about believing? How about some faith?
I'm tired of remorse. How about some truth now honey, oh?
I've tried to wait for the sea to come up, I've tried to wait to be home you know
You know I, I'm the city ghost, now tired of city life, now I'm the ghost of ghost of city life
So working in the mornin' There's no heaven on the field
I'm tired of this void. How about some truth now honey, oh?
I've tried to wait to be home, you know
I've tried to wait to for the sea to come up
You know I, I'm the city ghost, now tired of city life, now I'm the ghost of ghost of city life
How about some dreams now?
I'm tired enough to fade
How about some dreams now, hunny?
I'm tired enough to fadeYou might also likeEmbed
