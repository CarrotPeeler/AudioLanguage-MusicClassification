3 ContributorsIce Cream Man LyricsClicking by your house about two forty-five
Sidewalk sundae, strawberry surprise
Got a cherry popsicle right on time
I got a big stick, mama, that'll blow your mind
Well, I'm your ice cream man
I'm your one-man band
Your ice cream man
Baby, I'll be good to you
If you missed me in the alley, baby, don't you fret
I'll be coming back around and don't forget
When you're tired and you're hungry and you want something cool
I got something better than a swimming pool
I'm your ice cream man
I'm your one-man band
I'm your ice cream man
Baby, I'll be good to you
If you see me coming and you ain't got no change
Don't worry, baby, it can be arranged
Show me a smile, just for me
I'll fix you with a drumstick and I'll do it for free
I'm your ice cream man
I'm your one-man band
I'm your ice cream man
And baby, I'll be good to you
You might also like
If you missed me in the alley, baby, don't you fret
I'll be coming back around and don't forget
When you're tired and you're hungry and you want something cool
I got something better than a swimming pool
I'm your ice cream man
I'm your one-man band
I'm your ice cream man
And baby, I'll be good to you
I'm your ice cream man
I'm your one-man band
I'm your ice cream man
Baby, I'll be good to you
I'm your ice cream man
Chocolate and vanilla
I'm your ice cream man
Strawberry fella
I'm your ice cream man
I'm your chocolate man
I'm your black walnuts
Hanging from a can
Ice cream
Sweet dreams
Butterscotch
Pecan cherry
Blackberries
Yeah, I'm full of them blackberries
I'm your ice cream
Somthin' you only dream
