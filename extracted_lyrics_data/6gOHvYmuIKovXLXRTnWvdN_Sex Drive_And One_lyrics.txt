She's waiting for the moment on the water bed
Sex drive, the night is near
It feels like home but something's going wrong here
'Cause I am alone, there's nothing to moan
Pop pop pop!
Flying over your head now
'Cause I am alone, there's nothing to moan
Pop pop pop!
Flying over your head now
Sex drive, slut ahead
She's waiting for the moment on the water bed
Sex drive, the night is near
It feels like home but something's going wrong here
'Cause I am alone there's nothing to moan
Pop pop pop!
Flying over your head now
'Cause I am alone there's nothing to moan
Pop pop pop!
Flying over your head now
Flying over your head now
You might also like'Cause I am alone there's nothing to moan
Pop pop pop!
Flying over your head now
'Cause I am alone there's nothing to moan
Pop pop pop!
Flying over your head now
Flying over your head now
Flying over your head nowEmbed
