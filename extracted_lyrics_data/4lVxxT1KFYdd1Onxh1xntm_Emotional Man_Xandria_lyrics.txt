2 ContributorsEmotional Man LyricsWatch my poster on the wall
View my pictures on the magazines you store to have them all
Let me be your guiding light
Be the salt inside the wounds of your most ordinary life
Come closer - what you want is what you see
Desire - but you won't dare talk to me
So pure a lie - a hymn for the emotional man
So clean and shy - get it while you can
And yes, what I am is not what you see
Your interest's somewhere else
Your carnal longings make you all the same
Writing letters, sending mails
Offering me your honest interest in what's inside of me
No sins on your mind, of course
Pretend to intellectualize another wasted girl resource
You tell me - you knew what I need
So sorry - for the hypocrit I feed
So pure a lie - a hymn for the emotional man
So clean and shy - get it while you can
And yes, what I am is not what you see
Your interest's somewhere else
Your carnal longings make you all the same
 - you tell me I had a name
 - and not what you might think to see
 - whose image of me is not mine
 - tell you you may kiss...
So pure a lie - a hymn for the emotional man
So clean and shy - get it while you can
And yes, what I am is not what you see
So pure a lie - a hymn for the emotional man
So clean and shy - get it while you can
And yes, what I am is not what you see
Your interest's somewhere else
Your carnal longings make you all the sameYou might also likeEmbed
