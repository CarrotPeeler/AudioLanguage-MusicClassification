7 ContributorsOur Anniversary LyricsIt's our anniversary
I leave it ajar
And go outside
To look at the driveway stars
The crickets are chirping
They stop at my step
I stop my step
And they start up again
It's our anniversary and the bullfrogs
And everything that can sing is singing
Its mating song
The soil is steaming, grass is swooning
Guns or fireworks are popping
Down in the town, a woman is running
A man jumps up and down
It's our anniversary and you've hidden my keys
This is one anniversary you're spending with me
I slide in the front seat, the driver's side
To hotwire and hightail crosses my mind
But still in the driveway fixed like the stars
You might also likeI flip on the headlights and go back inside
The climate's controlled while the battery dies
Clipping the wings of your morning flight
The night will end
In some form of excess
Pants around ankles
Too weak to fully undress
It's our anniversary
A celebration of and here's to next year
Maybe you'll join me in my car
We'll drive together, but not too far
We are far from flowers cut and dried
So let us thrive, let us thrive
Let us thrive, let us thrive
Just like the weeds we curse sometimesEmbed
