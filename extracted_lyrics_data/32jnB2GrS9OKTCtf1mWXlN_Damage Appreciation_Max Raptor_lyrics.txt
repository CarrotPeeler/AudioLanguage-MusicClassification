2 ContributorsDamage Appreciation LyricsFriends and texts
For the cronically depressed
And the question's fast
Universe in our request
As you are what you don't do
What you don't do, you'll never do
Friends and texts
For the opposite of sex
Where the facts go fast
And if ours can't take
And do, oh, what you don't know
What you don't know, you'll never know
Your calm soul can't see much pain
Traced by the morning sun

Well I'm on bay's list
Never out of luck
And the mainstream
Never say, never goes
Uh-oh medicine
Life starts douche
Staying upside down
I'm the spearing of community

For the cronically depressed
In the space, in the pin
That I'm saying for the rest
As you are, oh, what you don't do
What you don't do, you'll never know
Money sucks
I'm never out of shock
Never out of luck
Never into sport
Doesn't change
As you are, oh, what you don't do
What you don't know, you'll never know
Your calm soul can't see much pain
Traced by the morning sun

Uh-oh medicine
Life starts douche
Staying upside down
I'm the spearing of community
Out in the cold, you need a friend
Out in the cold, you need a friend
Out in the cold, you need a friend
Out in the cold, you need a friend
Out in the cold, you need a friend
Out in the cold, you need a friend
Out in the cold, you need a friend
Out in the cold, you need a friend
Your calm soul can't see much pain
Traced by the morning sun
