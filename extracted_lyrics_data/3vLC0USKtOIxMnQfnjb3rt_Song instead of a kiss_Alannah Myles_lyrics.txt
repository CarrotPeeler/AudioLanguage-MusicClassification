Baby, this is a song instead of a kiss
For all of you who ache, who long
For nights like this
Song instead of a touch
Darlin', this is a song instead of a touch
To all of you who wait so long
And need so much
It is for those who like to cling
It is to those, to those I sing
Here is a song instead of a clutch, instead of a moon
Instead of a soothing touch in the afternoon
It is for those who like to cling
It is to those, to those I sing
Here is a song instead of a clutch, instead of a moon
Instead of a soothing touch in the afternoonYou might also likeEmbed
