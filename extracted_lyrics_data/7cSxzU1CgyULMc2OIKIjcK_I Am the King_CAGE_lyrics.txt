2 ContributorsI Am The King LyricsBorn into fire, die by the blade
This is the life I have made
Now the war's coming on again
Treacherous dog end this charade
I'm coming to put you away
I put fear in the hearts of men
Legions are gathering deep in the night
Prepare for the end of your reign
Might and magic will finally collide
The heavens will tremble and shake
Hail! Hail! Born to be king!
Hail! Hail! Rule everything!
Hail! Hail! Stand by my side
As a legend is born tonight!
I've been to hell and back to overtake the throne
I am the king!
This wicked legacy is mine and mine alone
I am the king!
Your twisted treachery, this bloodbath has been settled
I am the king!
Bow down and kiss the ring, I wear the crown of metal
The king!
You might also likeSinew and steel will carry the day
Slashing and blasting away
No more will you claim this land
Sick is your sorcery, ill is your mind
No mercy from me you will find
I'll strike you down where you stand
Legions are gathering deep in the night
Prepare for the end of your reign
Might and magic will finally collide
The heavens will tremble and shake
Hail! Hail! Born to be king!
Hail! Hail! Rule everything!
Hail! Hail! Stand by my side
As a legend is born tonight!
I've been to hell and back to overtake the throne
I am the king!
This wicked legacy is mine and mine alone
I am the king!
Your twisted treachery, this bloodbath has been settled
I am the king!
Bow down and kiss the ring, I wear the crown of metal
The king!Embed
