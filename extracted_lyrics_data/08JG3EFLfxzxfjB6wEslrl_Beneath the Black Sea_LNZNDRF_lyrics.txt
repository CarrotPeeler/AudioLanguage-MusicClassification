4 ContributorsBeneath the Black Sea LyricsIt all smells like rubber gumshoes
Radar bleeps blood red sugar, and we lose
And time, time, time, time, time’s a moving, in twos
And time, time, time, time, time’s a moving, in twos
The Right hits like water and bold moves
Deformative and discipled, and we lose
Time, time, time, time, time’s a moving, in twos
Time, time, time, time, time’s a moving, in twos
You watch another slip away, it’s you
You watch another slip away, it’s you
You watch another slip away, it’s you
You watch another slip away, it’s you
Way beneath the black sea, there’s no sound
And time, time, time, time, time’s a moving, in twos
And time, time, time, time, time’s a moving, in twos
You watch another slip away, it’s you
You watch another slip away, it’s you
You watch another slip away, it’s you
You watch another slip away, it’s youYou might also likeEmbed
