3 ContributorsCrazy in Love LyricsAin't funny how time
Steals the feelings from a love affair
And there's no place to lay the blame
And it ain't a case of no one cares
Helplessly we watch it fade away
Neither will admit it
But we're both aching to say
Weeooh I miss the days when we were crazy in love
When you weren't so sure of me
And I had my little jealousies
Weeooh bring back the days when we were crazy in love
I want to feel that way again
Remember when
We were crazy in love
It used to be so easy
One kiss and I was high
I could get intoxicated
Just by looking in your eyes
Baby is there nothing we can do
Cause you know I'm missing you
Pray to God you miss me too
Weeooh I miss the days when we were crazy in love
When you weren't so sure of me
And I had my little jealousies
Weeooh bring back the days when we were crazy in love
I want to feel that way again
Remember when
We were crazy in love
