3 ContributorsRussian Roulette Lyrics
Take it or leave it I've heard it been said
All this spring fever's just way over my head
Stealing my moments, taking up all my time
It's playing Russian roulette with my mind

None of my business baby just what's going on
I'm not gonna wait till somebody throw me a bone
I'm way out on a limb now, and nothing seems to rhyme
It's playing Russian roulette with my mind

I think that you've caught on, that you've been used and all
I'm going down New Orleans, I've got to see Dr. John
Got my mojo working, everything will be fine
Stop playing Russian roulette with my mind

It's not easy baby when everything starts getting out of control
Hang on to your hat now, hang on to your soul
Don't worry baby, I wanna throw you the line
They're playing Russian roulette with your mind

There's too many hustlers and I've been here before
None of them really know just who that you are
Everything gets contracted and space gets confined
They're playing Russian roulette with your mind
You might also like
They're playing Russian roulette
They're playing Russian roulette
They're playing Russian roulette with your mind
They're playing Russian roulette
They're playing Russian roulette
They're playing Russian roulette with your mind (Harp solo)
