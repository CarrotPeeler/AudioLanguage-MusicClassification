3 ContributorsEleven LyricsEleven is the luck most people haven't
Eleven is the navel of ideas
Eleven is like a light in a gloomy cavern
Eleven is the haven of your fears
Eleven – more can never come
You ask what is there to be done?
It's up to you when it will run
Eleven is all I can and can't imagine
Eleven is a hint of destiny
Eleven – you got it, well I never
Elеven – a lucky number you will see
Elevеn – more can never come
It's up to you when it will run
Don't ask what is there to be doneYou might also likeEmbed
