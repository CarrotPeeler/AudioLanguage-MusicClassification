5 ContributorsSex (Iâ€™m a) LyricsDan, I need you now
OK Mikey, come
Feel the fire
Feel my love inside you so bright
There's a sound
And the smell of love on my mind
I'm the toy
Come and play with me, say work now
Wrap your legs
Around me, ride me tonight
Sex, sex, sex
I'm a man
I'm a goddess
I'm a man
I'm a virgin
I'm a man
I'm a blue movie
I'm a man
I'm a bitch
I'm a man
I'm a geisha
I'm a man
I'm a little girl
I'm a man
And we'll make love together
You might also likeWhy does man go to hooker
First of all because
He quite often is not all that happy and sexual satisfied at home
His wife won't perform all the activities that he has in mind
And most of all, oral sex is a taboo
The woman would say "What do you think I am, a whore?
I don't want to do that!"
Slip and slide
When you're where you like to feel the blood flow
Not too fast
Don't be slow, my love's in your hands
I'm a man
I'm a boy
I'm a man
I'm your mother
I'm a man
I'm a one night stand
I'm a man
I'm a bi
I'm a man
I'm your slave
Well, I'm a man
I'm a little girl
I'm a man
And we'll make love together
Most of them come to a hooker, say
"My wife, oh my wife. Is she dead in bed
She's frigid, cold as a starfish!"
They take off the pants
And their underpants
There's nothing more ridiculous than a guy with his party socks on
He dives into the bedroom
He says, "Do me. Suck it."
Skin to skin
Honey hold tight
Come inside it's a passion play just for you
Let's get lost in the magic place alone now
Drink your fill from a fountain of love wet your lips
I'm a man
I'm a teaser
I'm a man
I'm a virgin
I'm man
I'm a one night stand
I'm a man
I'm a drug
I'm a man
I'm your slave
I'm a man
I'm a dream to find
I'm a man
And we'll make love together
I'm a man
I'm a goddess
I'm a man
I'm a hooker
I'm a man
I'm a blue movie
I'm a man
I'm a slut
I'm a man
Well, I'm your babe
I'm a man
I'm a dream to find
I'm a man
And we'll make love together
We'll make love together
We'll make love together
We'll make love together
We'll make love together
Fucking piece of shit
One little, two little, three little indians
Suck it, firehoseEmbed
