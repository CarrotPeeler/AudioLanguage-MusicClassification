Well, have you ever seen a girl for whom your soul you'd give
For who you'd fight for, die for, pray to God to live?
'Cause she's so fine, she's so fine
She's really sweet, the finest girl you ever wanna meet
Well, she really fills her clothes from head to toe
I want the world to know I love her, love her so
She's all right, she's all right
She's all right, she loves me day and night
Ohh, ohh, ohh, ohh
Ohh, ohh, ohh, ohh
Reet petite, the finest girl
You ever wanna meet, ohh
Well, she's like honey from a bee, like peaches from a tree
I love her, need her, she means so much to me
She's all right, she's got what it takes
She's got what it takes and with me she really rates
Well, ohh, now, she's my cutie, my tutti frutti
My heart, my love, my bathing beauty
She's all right, she's got just what it takes
She's got what it takes and with me she really rates
Ohh, ohh, ohh, ohh
Ohh, ohh, ohh, ohh
