I'm creepin' your way and these sheets aren't stoppin' me
Because I'm gonna meet you face to face
And I'm gonna start from your waist up through your navel
And we're approaching such a place

This is where we both get scared
This is where emotion flares
This is where we both prepare

Navigate me through your body
Navigate me
I love the way you talk on top of me
So navigate me through your body

I'm creepin' your way and these sheets aren't stoppin' me
Thats right it's quite simply
These sheets aren't stoppin' me
Cause my mind's on a mission
And a mind on a mission
Is a mind that you just set free
I'm creepin' your way
I'm creepin' your

Cause a mind on a mission
With enough ammunition
And the right proposition
Is a mind that you might set free
Cause a mind on a mission
With enough ammunition
And the proper position
Is a mind that you just set free
I love the way you talk on top me
So navigate me

I'm creepin' your way
I'm creepin' your way1Embed
