Mhm
Yo
Hoii, mon!
Yush!
Shinehead again...well me nah show you, man?
Back to back we a deal with it, enuh brother
For real, enuh
New York crew, we haffi big unuh up, see it?
We have just...step up inna life and gwan strive said way, you hear?
Yes!

Don't drink coffee, I drink roots, my dear
And I love my morning ride
You can see it in my motions when I walk
I'm a Jamaican in New York
See me walking down Church Avenue
With my hat leaned to one side
You can see it when I walk
I'm a Jamaican in New York

I'm an alien, I'm a legal alien
I'm a Jamaican in New York
I'm an alien, I'm a legal alien
I'm a Jamaican in New York
You might also like
Roughness maketh man, as someone said
He is the rude boy of the day
Takes a man to make a stand, sometimes get wild
Be yourself, no matter what they say

I'm an alien, I'm a legal alien
I'm a Jamaican in New York
I'm an alien, I'm a legal alien
I'm a Jamaican in New York

Nicing up a party can lead to notoriety
Pretty soon they'll know you as the Don
Because we live so hearty, Babylon don't like we
Still we're gonna party 'til the sun

And you don't stop, you proceed
And this is the riddim and rhyme you need
Shinehead's gonna take the lead
Me nah show no man
Settle unuh self
All yard man, put up your hand
And let the world know that you have ambition
All yardie man, put up your hand
And let the world know that you have ambition
Well a we, well a we a yardie
A weh we deh? We de a New York City
A weh se come yah fa?
No to make some money
We have to do that to feed we family
Chucking badness does not make a man
And we're not the only ones with guns
Confront your enemies, outsmart them if you can
But if all else fails, you better run
Roughness maketh man, as someone said
He is the rude boy of the day
Takes a man to make a stand, sometimes get wild
Be yourself, no matter what they say

I'm an alien, I'm a legal alien
I'm a Jamaican in New York
I'm an alien, I'm a legal alien
I'm a Jamaican in New York
I'm an alien
I'm a Jamaican in New York
I'm an alien
I'm a Jamaican in New York

Yeah mon, a so we love give it to dem, man...back to back
And even if you anuh Jamaican, I waan you step up inna life sameway
You hear?!
This is still a family affair, man...
On the strip of reality
Anyway, all crew and all massive...
Just gwan strive, you hear sah
Yes!1Embed
