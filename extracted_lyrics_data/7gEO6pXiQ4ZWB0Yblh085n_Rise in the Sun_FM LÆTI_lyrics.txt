1 ContributorRise in the sun LyricsTouching the sky
My day seems a bit brighter now
Taking a fly
I am glad and it feels so right
I won't be jaded
It won't be wasted
Go my love rise in the sun
I won't be jaded
Won't leave things fading
Let me tell you once again
I wouldn't trade a thing I gain
But in the end
Don't tell me this is just a plan
In the scheme of things
I am seeing it all clearer now
I won't be jaded
It won't be wasted
Go my love rise in the sun
I won't be jaded
Won't leave things wasted
Let me tell you once again
I wouldn't trade a thing I've gained
Caught in the race
My blues have come to fade away
In the scheme of things
I know they're sure to stay at bay
For this once time
Is this one time?
Go my love rise in the sun
For this one time
I am gonna make things alright
Let me tell you once again
I wouldn't trade a thing I gain
For this once time
Is this one time?
Go my love rise in the sun
For this one time
I am gonna make things alright
Let me tell you once again
I wouldn't trade a thing I gain
Let me tell you once again
I wouldn't trade a thing I gainYou might also likeEmbed
