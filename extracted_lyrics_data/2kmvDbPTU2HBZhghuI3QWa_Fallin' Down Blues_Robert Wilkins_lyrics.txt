1 ContributorFallinâ€™ Down Blues LyricsI'm tired of standin' on the long lonesome road
I'm tired of standin' on the long lonesome road
Thinkin' 'bout my baby and got nowhere to go
It's as far down the road, friend, as I can see
It's as far down the road, friend, as I can see
See the woman I love standin' wavin' after me
I run to her, friend, fell down at her knee
I run to her, friend, fell down at her knee
Cryin', "Take me back, baby, God knows, if you please"
If you don't believe, girl, I'll treat you right
If you don't believe, girl, I'll treat you right
Come and walk with me down to my lovin' shack tonight
I'll certainly treat you just like you was white
I'll certainly treat you just like you was white
That don't satisfy you, girl, I'll take your life
I love you, girl, I will tell the world I do
I love you, girl, I will tell the world I do
And that's the reason you treat me like you do
But go ahead, girl, that will be all right for you
But go ahead, girl, that will be all right for you
I will meet you someday when you're down in hard luck, tooYou might also likeEmbed
