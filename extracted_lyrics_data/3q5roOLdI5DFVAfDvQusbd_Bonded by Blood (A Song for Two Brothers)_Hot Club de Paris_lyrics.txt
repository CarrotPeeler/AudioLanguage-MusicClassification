Then one has fulfilled ones parent’s goal
And if one can work as a member of a team
Then one has achieved ones parent’s dream
If one can work an unsupervised role
Then one has fulfilled ones parent’s goal
And if one can work as a member of a team
Then one has achieved ones parent’s dream
So, club us into a brand new status
(Club club club club club club club hot club)
And teach us to score some sluts
(Club club club club club club club hot club)
Won't you club us into a brand new status
(Club club club club club club club hot club)
And teach us to score some sluts
(Club club club club club club club hot club)
(Won't you club us into a brand new status
And teach us to score some sluts)
I want to buy property in the dump-end of town
(Won't you club us into a brand new status
And teach us to score some sluts)
I want a job where, where I get to lie down all day
Until I’m carving cartilage and talking marriage
I can promise you pretty ones champagne fountains
And ice sculpted swans
