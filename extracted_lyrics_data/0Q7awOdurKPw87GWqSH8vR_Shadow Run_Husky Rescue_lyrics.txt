1 ContributorShadow Run LyricsHey my girl, let's run together
Shadow nights will last forever
Dark night, black light, shadow nights
Girls and boys ran out tonight
Shadow boys, dark finger snaps
Black dark alley, it's the shadow claps
Echoes whispers silent voice
Sounds of shadow, the shadow voice
Girls, get ready the night is young
Shadow girls are on the run
Girls, get ready the night is young
Shadow boys are on the run
Girls, get ready the night is young
Girls, get ready the night is young
Shadow boys are on the run
Girls, get ready the night is young
Shadow boys are on the run
Girls, get ready the night is young
Shadow boys are on the run
Girls, get ready the night is young
Shadow boys are on the run
Hey my girl, let's run together
Shadow nights will last forever
Dark night, black light, shadow nights
Girls and boys ran out tonight
Shadow boys, dark finger snaps
Black dark alley, it's the shadow claps
Echoes whispers silent voice
Sounds of shadow, the shadow voice
