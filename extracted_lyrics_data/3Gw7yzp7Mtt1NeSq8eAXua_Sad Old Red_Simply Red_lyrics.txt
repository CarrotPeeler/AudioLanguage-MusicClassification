I walk on stone, it leads me home
We don't have streets, just pure concrete
I'm not glad when I get home
I'm sad old Red, I don't wanna be alone no more

I go watering my face
My feet begin to shake
I go upstairs to that heavenly place
I'm not glad when I get home
I'm sad old Red, I don't wanna be alone no more

Sad old Red, sat at home
Sad old Red, living on his own
Sad old Red, sat at home
Sad old Red, let me take you home


It's a cubic room, two holes peep through
Shadows on the wall of trees so tall
I think of her again, the joy she used to bring
Lay there in bed two words she said
She said "Oh Red"
She said "Oh Red"
She said "Oh Red"
Every night "Oh Red"

Sad old Red, that's what I am
All the time, every night
Sad old Red, sad old Red
Sad old Red, sad old RedEmbed
