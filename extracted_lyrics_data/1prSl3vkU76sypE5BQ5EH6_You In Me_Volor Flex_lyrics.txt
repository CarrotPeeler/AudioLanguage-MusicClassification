If I had one wish, we would be best friends
Love would﻿ never end, it would just begin
If I had one wish, we would be best friends
Love would﻿ never end, it would just begin

Love would﻿ never end, it would just begin
If I had one wish, we would be best friends
Love would﻿ never end, it would just begin
Promise to love you, trust me I'll trust you
Promise to love you, trust me I'll trust you
Promise to love you, trust me I'll trust you
Promise to love you, trust me I'll trust you
Promise to love you, trust me I'll trust you
Promise to love you, trust me I'll trust you
Promise to love you, trust me I'll trust you
Promise to love you, trust me I'll trust you
