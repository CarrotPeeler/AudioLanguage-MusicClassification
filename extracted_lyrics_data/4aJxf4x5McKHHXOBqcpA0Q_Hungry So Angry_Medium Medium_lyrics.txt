4 ContributorsHungry, So Angry Lyrics
Tonight I’ve loved you
More than I’ve done for months
It made me feel so young
So hungry, so angry
Made me feel so young
So hungry, so angry

So hungry, so angry
So hungry, so angry
So hungry, so angry
So hungry, so angry
So hungry, so angry
So hungry, so angry
So hungry, so angry
So hungry, so angry

Cat looks for food
We don’t move
We don’t know what to do
We’re too scared to move

The TV blinks blue
It’s been finished for hours
And I write this down
You stare at the ground
As I write this down
We won’t make a sound
You might also like
Tonight I’ve loved you
More than I’ve done for months
It made me feel so young
So hungry, so angry
Made me feel so young
So hungry, so angry

So hungry, so angry
So hungry, so angry
So hungry, so angry
So hungry, so angry
So hungry, so angry
So hungry, so angry
So hungry, so angry
So hungry, so angry

Cat starts to preen
Blocks the screen
And it could break the spell
But the plot goes on
And I can hear people say
"Is there something wrong between you and John?"
It’ll embarrass you
'Cos you hate the way
I had to write this down
Yes you hate the way
I had to write this down

Tonight I’ve loved you
More than I’ve done for months
It made me feel so young
So hungry, so angry
Made me feel so young
So hungry, so angry

So hungry, so angry
So hungry, so angry
So hungry, so angry
So hungry, so angry
So hungry, so angry
So hungry, so angry
So hungry, so angry
So hungry, so angry

It made me feel so young
Made me feel so young
So hungry, so angry
So hungry, so angry
So hungry, so angry
So hungry, so angry
So hungry, so angry
So hungry, so angry
So hungry, so angry
So hungry, so angry
So hungry, so angry
So hungry, so angry
So hungry, so angry
So hungry, so angry
So hungry, so angry
So hungry, so angryEmbed
