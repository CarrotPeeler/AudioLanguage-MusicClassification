1 ContributorJump In The Fire LyricsLookin' down upon my cloud
The world looks worse to me
Yeah, I got lost along the way
Too late for sympathy
I peaked just fine and I held on tight
And drifted into space
We can blame it on your mattress
If that's what it takes
Headlights beam and I keep marchin' on
My head down and I'm coming on too strong
And I wonder will it be the end
I close my eyes and it all begins
I jump in the fire and it starts again
Nervous breakdown at 18
Fuck I feel the same
I'm hypnotized by the light
And melted by the pain
Bloodshot eyes and wasted time
Ridin' in the rain
Disguised as the highroad
Lies miles and miles of pain
Headlights beam and I keep marchin' on
My head down and I'm coming on too strong
And I wonder will it be the end?
I close my eyes and it all begins
I jump in the fire and it starts again
I close my eyes and it all begins
I jump in the fire and it starts again
Whoa, whoa
Headlights beam and I keep marchin' on
My head down and I'm coming on too strong
And I wonder will it be the end?
I close my eyes and it all begins
I jump in the fire and it starts again
I close my eyes and it all begins
I jump in the fire and it starts againYou might also likeEmbed
