When it's cold outside I've got the month of May
I guess you'll say what can make me feel this way?
My girl (My girl) talking about my girl (My girl)
I've got so much honey the bees envy me
I've got a sweeter song than the birds in the trees
Well, I guess you'll say what can make me feel this way?
My girl (My girl) talking about my girl (My girl)
(Hey, hey, hey)
(Hey, hey, hey)
I don't need no money, fortune or fame
I've got all the riches baby, one man can claim
Well, I guess you'll say what can make me feel this way?
My girl (My girl) talking about my girl (My girl)
I've got sunshine on a cloudy day with my girl
I've even got the month of May with my girl
Talkin' 'bout my girl (My girl)
