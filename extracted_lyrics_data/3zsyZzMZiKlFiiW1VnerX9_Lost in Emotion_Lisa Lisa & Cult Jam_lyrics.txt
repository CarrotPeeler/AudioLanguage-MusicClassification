10 ContributorsLost in Emotion Lyrics
Hit the beat now
Lost in emotion

Some guys will promise you a marriage made in heaven
But I'm gonna stick to my guns
Like waiting for that love that I might be getting
My dreams have yet begun, oh, baby

Am I a fool 'cause I don't know just how you feel?
And this love for you, oh I can't conceal, oh

I'm lost in emotion
Telling you things you really shouldn't know
I'm, baby, I'm lost in emotion
Am I a fool? At least my friends think so
Qué será, qué será

Baby, whatever will be
Qué será, qué será
Between you and me, oh-ooh
You might also like
Just how true are the rumors I am hearing
About the crush you have on me? (Ooh)
Oh, baby, I'm blind 'cause I just don't see it
But I wanna believe what they see
I find myself telling you things
I don't even tell my best friend (Ooh)
I keep showing emotions not knowing
Just where it all stems from

From time to time
I wonder what I am in your heart
(Sometimes you make me wonder, babe)
And even though I don't live there yet
I'm afraid it will be cold and dark

I'm lost in emotion
Telling you things you really shouldn't know
I'm, baby, I'm lost in emotion
Am I a fool? At least my friends think so
Qué será, qué será

Baby, whatever will be
Qué será, qué será
Between you and me, oh-ooh, no

Baby, am I a fool 'cause I don't know just how you feel?
(Just how you, just how you feel)
And this love for you, oh, I can't conceal
Hit the beat now

(Lost) With my feelings
(Lost) I hit the ceiling
(Lost) With big emotions (I, I, I, I love you, but I don't know)
(Lost) I can't be dealing
(Lost) I wanna be with you
(Lost) But I don't know how (But I don't know how)
(Lost) In my heart, babe
I can feel the beat now

(Lost in emotion)
(Lost in emotion)
(Lost in emotion)

(Lost)
My baby
You know that I'm lost
My baby
(Lost in emotion)
My-m-m-my-my baby
(Lost in emotion)
(Lost in emotion)
