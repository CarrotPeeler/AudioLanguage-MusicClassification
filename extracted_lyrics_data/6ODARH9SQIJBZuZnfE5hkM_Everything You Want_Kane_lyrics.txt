1 ContributorEverything You Want LyricsWho needs the confirmation
Everyday in observation?
Who needs the confirmation
Everyday?
Show 'm what you got, boy
Show 'm what it's not boy
Sing it
Who needs the confirmation
Every day in transformation?
Who needs the confirmation
Everyday?
But never on the run, boy
Who 'm how it's done, boy
Sing it now
It's everything I've got
Everything I own
Everything I try to remember
Everything I want
It's everything I need
Everything I trust
Everything I try to remember
It's everything you want
Who needs the confirmation
Everyday in expectation?
Who needs the confirmation
Everyday?
Step into the black, boy
Never hold it back, boy
Sing it
You might also likeWho needs the confirmation
Everyday determination?
Sorts out the players from the rest
And you will look 'm in the face, boy
Talent's not a waste boy
Sing it now
It's everything I've got
Everything I own
Everything I try to remember
Everything I want
It's everything I need
Everything I trust
Everything I try to remember
It's everything you want
It's everything you want
What you gonna do?
What you gonna do?
What you gonna do?
It's everything I've got
Everything I own
Everything I try to remember
Everything I want
It's everything I need
Everything I trust
Everything I try to remember
It's everything you want
It's everything you want
Everything you want
I'm everything you want
Everything you want
Everything you want
I'm everything you wantEmbed
