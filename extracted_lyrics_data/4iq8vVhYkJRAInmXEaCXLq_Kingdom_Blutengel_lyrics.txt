1 ContributorKingdom LyricsHey my little girl
Would you come to join me now?
I will show you then
What you've never seen before
Let me take you down
To my secret place tonight
I want to play with you
You just have to let yourself go
This is my Kingdom, these are my rules
You just have to follow me
You will be the Queen of all these pleasures eternally
Pain and sorrow, hate and fear
Everything's so far away
You will be the Queen, and I'm your King, forevermore
This is my Kingdom, these are my rules
You just have to follow me
You will be the Queen of all these pleasures eternally
Pain and sorrow, hate and fear
Everything's so far away
I will be the Queen, and you're my King, forevermore
We don't have to die
We don't have to be afraid
Nothing can do us harm
We are immortal

We're so young and we're so strong
We take what we want
We are the Lords of a new ageEmbed
