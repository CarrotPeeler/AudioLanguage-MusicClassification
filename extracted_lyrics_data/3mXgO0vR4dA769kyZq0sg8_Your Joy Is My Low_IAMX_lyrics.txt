6 ContributorsYour Joy is My Low Lyrics
Say it
Your joy, your joy is my low

He takes your face
And positions it to take your mouth
You bite
You bite to excite yourself
He wants
The colour of you to wear, and feel alive
So, you bite
And I'm awake and I'm a slave tonight (slave tonight)

You lie
You lie to spare my life
You needed it
He tasted you inside out

Say it
Your joy, your joy is my low
So, you wash yourself to start again
Say it
Your joy, your joy is my low
And when you crack the whip, I crawl again
You might also like
You shift the play
Push the curve to sit between your thighs
It's a sign
It's time to exercise the lines
You want
The double-cut through to wet
Invade and slide
So, you slide
And I'm awake
And I'm the slave tonight (slave tonight)

You lie
You lie to spare my life
You needed it
He tasted you inside out

Say it
Your joy, your joy is my low
So, you wash yourself to start again
Say it
Your joy, your joy is my low
And when you crack the whip, I crawl again
Say it
Your joy, your joy is my low
So, you wash yourself to start again
Say it
Your joy, your joy is my low
When you crack the whip, I crawl again
Say it
Your joy, your joy is my low
So, you wash yourself to start again
Say it
Your joy, your joy is my low

Your joy is my low
You wash yourself to start again
Ah, ah, ah

Say it
Your joy, your joy is my low
So, you wash yourself to start again
Say it
Your joy, your joy is my low
When you crack the whip, I crawl again
Say it
Your joy, your joy is my low
So, you wash yourself to start again
Say it
Your joy, your joy is my low
Your joy is my lowEmbed
