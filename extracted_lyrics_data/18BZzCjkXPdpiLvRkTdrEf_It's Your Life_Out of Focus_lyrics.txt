2 ContributorsSo What Lyrics
I don't care what you do, yeah, it's your life
We were walking around on a late night
And the bar played that song from the movie
I don't know what you said, could you repeat?
Lot of people around that I don't know
It's a comforting thought in the front row
Sitting on the sidewalk out of focus
Put my heart on my sleeve, have you noticed?

So what? I'm done, found another problem
Don't care enough, everything just went numb
So what? I'm done, found another problem
Don't care enough, everything just went—

What you want is to find, terrified to fall behind
That's okay, never mind, I will make the sacrifice
Bleeding out 'til I'm dry, failure by my own design
And at this point, it feels like I'll never be satisfied

So what? I'm done, found another problem
Don't care enough, everything just went numb
So what? I'm done, what's another problem?
Don't care enough, everything just went numb
So what? I'm done, found another problem
Don't care enough, everything just went numb
So what? I'm done, found another problem
Don't care enough, everything just went—You might also likeEmbed
