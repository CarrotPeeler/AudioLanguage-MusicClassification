Jeepers, creepers, where'd you get those peepers?
Jeepers, creepers, where'd you get those eyes?
Gosh all, giddum, how'd they get so liddum?
Gosh all, giddum, how'd they get that size?
Golly gee, when you turn those heaters on
Woe is me, got to put my cheaters on
Jeepers, creepers, where'd you get those peepers?
Oh, those weepers, how they hypnotize
Where'd you get those eyes?
And now the author, Johnny Mercer

Jeepers, creepers, where'd you get those peepers?
Oh, those weepers, how they hypnotize
Gosh all, get up, how'd they get so lit up?
Gosh all, get up, how'd they get that size?
Golly gee, when you turn those heaters on
Woe is me, got to put my cheaters on
Jeepers, creepers, where'd you get those peepers?
Oh, those weepers, how they hypnotize
Where'd you get those eyes?
Miss Billie Holiday

Jeepers, creepers, where'd you get those peepers?
Jeepers, creepers, where'd you get those eyes?
Gosh all, get up, how'd you get so lit up?
Gosh all, get up, where'd you get that size?
Golly gee, when you turn those heaters on
Woe is me, got to put my cheaters on
Jeepers, creepers, where'd you get those peepers?
Oh, those weepers, how they hypnotize, boy
Where'd you get those eyes?
