Are you made of love sent from above to me
Can this really be
Oh dragonfly now you’re in my dreams
And though you seem so far
You’re my shining star
Dragonfly can you be for real
Every glimpse I steal leads me on
Dragonfly your kiss devours
I’m dying so sweetly
Dragonfly where can I find you
I’ve searched everywhere but still no sign of you
This just can’t be true
Dragonfly so veiled in mystery
You’re a work of art that breaks my heart in two
What am I to do
Dragonfly can you be for real
Every glimpse I steal leads me on
Dragonfly your kiss devours
I’m dying so sweetly
You might also likeBeware how they warned
A guy could fall for you
Something a spy should never do
So release me from your arms
I insist you set me free
Dragonfly can you be for real
Every glimpse I steal leads me on
Dragonfly your kiss devours
I’m dying so sweetly
All hope’s lost I fear
I’m in love its true
I’d betray the world for you
So darling tell me why
Do we have to say goodbye
Please untie me nowEmbed
