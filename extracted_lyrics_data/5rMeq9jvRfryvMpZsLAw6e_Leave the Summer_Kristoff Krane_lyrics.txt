8 ContributorsLeave the Summer Lyrics
They're on the I don't wanna leave the summer
I'm more on the let the storm wander with the feedback hunger
Mother never mumbles under breath
Says treat the world like you love it and that's how you'll be treated back
I seldom hesitate when called into the light
Because I know there's someone else alive who feels the same as I do
And if take a stand and follow my guide perhaps I'll become a leader in the eyes if I go blind tomorrow
Still cryin' the mask not afraid to admit
If lost I gotta ask What's the task I've been given?
Cause if I miss what I pass on the path when it twists
There'll be no turning in the visit like it already happened but didn't
I'm not alone, that's all I really need for the comforting realization that nothing is guaranteed
I want nothing in return
But the piece of something stolen once I find out where it was I'd say I knew and so I don't

There's a rainbow making fun of where my suns afraid to go
If I tickle let it touch it's just enough to make it grow
If I let it get too close then I suppose it wasn't real
That's how memory controls the suffering that makes me feel
Out of control, confused, afraid to keep it warm
War is leading me astray and I'm not too sure what it is for

I've learned how to hurt I can learn how to heal
A turn for the worst is a new earth to build
Ive got a niche for intervention when disease is wild
But prefer a firm connection to preserve my inner child
Enter winter as a center man forget that saint knight in shining armor first a picture what it's like to sink
Or swim. It all comes in waves
So concerned with the ending that the moment drifts away
I don't float like I used to so I refuse to promote self control if it's suited to abuse you
Let the swing sway sideways blacked out set spring time fever free with the breath stretched out
Stressed out from the peace that I know something sold
If I find out where it was I'd say I knew and so I don't
Yet I'm grateful when I stop in my tracks and think about what I have
Instead of falling in that trap again
You might also like
There's a rainbow making fun of where my suns afraid to go
If I tickle let it touch it's just enough to make it grow
If I let it get too close then I suppose it wasn't real
That's how memory controls the suffering that makes me feel
Out of control, confused, afraid to keep it warm
War is leading me astray and I'm not too sure what it is for
There's a rainbow making fun of where sun's afraid to go
There's a rainbow making fun of where my suns afraid to go
If I tickle let it touch it's just enough to make it grow
If I let it get too close then I suppose it wasn't real
That's how memory controls the suffering that makes me feel
Out of control, confused, afraid to keep it warm
War is leading me astray and I'm not too sure what it is forEmbed
