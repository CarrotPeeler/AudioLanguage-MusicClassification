2 ContributorsWhy Why Why LyricsDidn't wake up a prodigy
Born to a middle class New York family
Thinking
'Why why why?
Why's it like that?'
You miss your days in California
Looping round wishing you were still there
Thinking
'Why why why?
Why's it like that?'
Fighting your given tongue
Shaking your fist til it's gone, gone
Praying for it all night long
Just waiting
To listen to your children's cries
Listen to your heart, how it sighs!
Think you got a ghost in your dance
Reminding of the days when you had romance
Thinking
'Why why why?
Why's it like that?'
He's the one that made you choose
Talk 'bout a family, a pass to the world thru his shoes
Thinking
'Why why why?
Why's it like that?'

Just waiting
To listen to your children's cries
Listen to your heart, how it sighs!Embed
