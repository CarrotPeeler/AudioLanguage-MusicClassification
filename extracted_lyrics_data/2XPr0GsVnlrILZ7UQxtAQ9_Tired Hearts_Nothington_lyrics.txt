7 ContributorsThe Feeling of Loneliness Never Goes Away Lyrics
I reach up towards the sky
But it's like I just sink lower and lower
Until I fade into nothingness
And my heart becomes
Colder and colder slowly
Until I wanna make
The pain go away closing my eyes
I wish it could be all over
I feel like I don't belong here
In this world of lies
Smile disguises the sadness I hide inside
Enjoy my sorrow
Wouldn't be surprised if you laughed at my tears
As they stain my shirt
Write a verse
Temporarily takes the feeling away
Then the pain returns
Every day I question my worth
A curse or a blessing at birth
I don't have concern for myself no more
My soul is finally broken
Along with what was once my heart for
It's forever shattered
In the dark, I converse with shadows
We tend to argue a lot
And sometimes I wish I was buried
Fear not, my body will rot alone
This feeling won't stop
I hope the angels keep watch
I don't know if I can hold on any longer this song I wrote
'cause I'm tired of feeling so alone
But when I am... I feel at peace
When I'm around people
This happiness is a facade that everybody sees
And I hate it because I can't change the way I am
So alone I'll stay, remaining by myself
But this feeling, this feeling isn't well
Feeling like it's hell 
Will my scars ever heal?

I swear this feeling never goes away
I swear this feeling never goes away
The feeling of loneliness, the feeling of loneliness never goes away
It never goes away, it never goes away, this feeling of loneliness never goes away, just
Loneliness, just the
Never goes away
Just
Never goes away, the feeling of loneliness
Just never goes away
It never goes away1Embed
