To those you live with
A little bit of love, oh
Has gotta come your way
Well, in my mind
It's easy to lose sight of the truth
But in my heart I can't deny
My feeling inside
'Cause I believe if you give a little bit of love
To those you live with
A little bit of love
Has gotta come your way
Man in the sky you say you're flying
To lose sight of the world
You wanna stay high
Then don't deny your feeling inside
'Cause I believe
If you give a little bit of love
To those you live with
A little bit of love, oh babe
Has gotta come your way
You might also likeI believe if you give a little bit of love
To those you live with
A little bit of love, oh
Has gotta come your way
I believe if you give a little bit of love
To those you live with
A little bit of love
Has gotta come your wayEmbed
