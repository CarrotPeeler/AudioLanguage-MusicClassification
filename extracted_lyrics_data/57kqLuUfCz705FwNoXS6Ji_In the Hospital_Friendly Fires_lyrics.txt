Doo do do do doo do doo do dooo do do
Doo do do do do
Doo do do do doo do doo do dooo do do
Lying alone
In the hospital
I can't do anything right
When I'm with someone like you
Oh deep in my heart, yes I know
Our love's run out
Oh deep in my heart, yes I know
I caused this row
Nothing is lost
Only a memory
A glitch in my heart
'Till you come back to me
Nothing is lost
Only a memory
A glitch in my heart
'Till you come back to me

Doo do do do do
Doo do do do doo do doo do dooo do do
Lying alone
In the hospital
Don't wanna check myself out
If I'm going home to you
Oh deep in my heart, yes I know
Your love will soon wear out
Oh deep in my heart, yes I know
I think you'll work something out
Nothing is lost
Only a memory
A glitch in my heart
'Till you come back to me
Nothing is lost
Only a memory
A glitch in my heart
'Till you come back to me
*instrumenta (get your groove on)l*
Nothing is lost
Only a memory
A glitch in my heart
'Till you come back to me
Nothing is lost
Only a memory
A glitch in my heart
'Till you come back to me
