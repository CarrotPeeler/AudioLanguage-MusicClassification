1 ContributorCome in 2s LyricsJust wanted it to be you and me
Didn't expect any of this unwanted company
I just wanted you to see me
(Wanted you to see me)
Wanted you to see me all alone
Just wanted us to walk along the shore
Than to see another shadow at the door
I just wanted you to leave me
(Wanted you to leave me)
Wanted you to leave me all alone
It's the same old thing
It's always more than you
Tear my heart again
'Cause this is what you do
You always come in 2's
Tear myself, prepare myself for you
Oh, plan it out, I hope it doesn't fall
Well, I see steps, I hear whispers
Feel this heat and I start to shiver, oh
It's the same old thing
It's always more than you
Tear my heart again
'Cause this is what you do
You might also likeYou always come in
And I say it will be fine
But you had to cross the line
Can't you see, I'm trying
I'm trying, you know I'm trying
Just wanted it to be you and me
Just wanted it to be you and meEmbed
