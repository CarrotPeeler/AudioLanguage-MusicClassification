Onto your street now the fear is growing
It's the shakes and the shivers and moans
This time I know
Through the shakes and the shivers and moans
Got to let you go
No easy way to the place I'm going
Up to your door now the fear is flowing
Through the shakes and the shivers and moans
Got to let you know
Through the shakes and the shivers and moans
Got to let you go
Shake, shiver and moan I'm ready for you
Shake, shiver and moan I'm ready for you
Now my aim is steady and true
Got to let you know
You can beg you struggle and cry
Got to let you go
Now my aim is steady and true
Got to let you know
You can beg you struggle and cry
Got to let you go
You might also likeFast or slow either way I'm going
Cruel or kind in my mind I'm going
Through the shakes and the shivers and moans x 3
Got to let you go
Through the shakes and the shivers and moans x 3
Got to let you goEmbed
