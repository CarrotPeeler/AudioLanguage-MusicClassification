3 ContributorsTotal Recall LyricsIt's all such a blur when time goes so quickly
Trying to hang on to the way that you'd like things to stay
You trace back the seconds, recall the details
From someone will, to someone does
To someone did, you know I did
Oh, there must be a hole in your memory
But I can see, I can see
A distant victory
A time when you will be with me
You cut me off just as I was starting to speak
The language you keep hidden away
Just like the question on everyone's lips
But it's not on mine
Where all you'll find is a twisted smile from another time
Another time, another time
Oh, there must be a hole in your memory
But I can see, I can see
A distant victory
A time when you will be with me
Another time, another time
Oh, there must be a hole in your memory
But I can see, I can see
A distant victory
A time when you will be with me
There'd be another time, another time
Oh, there must be a hole in your memory
But I can see, I can see
A distant victory
A time when you will be with me
You might also likeI can see
But there's got to be another time
It's got to beEmbed
