2 ContributorsKiss the Judas LyricsShe took you up to the seventh cloud
You had time to fall
Is it that what you've been dreaming of
A promise big as the universe
And all the best for free
She ripped you off just when you fell in love
I know how it feels
I know how it hurts
It's the disappointment
That makes you feel so sad
I know you can top it
I know that you will
A smile in your face
One last embrace
To kiss the judas
To kiss the judas
Mom is dead and dad's in buffalo
A long way to go
You paid the ticket but she does not come back
Enjoy a night under candlelight
If you pay the cheque
Her lips so red
And the future looks so blackYou might also likeEmbed
