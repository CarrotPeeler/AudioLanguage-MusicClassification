4 ContributorsConquistadores Lyrics
Exploring the seas to conquer new lands
Troops arrayed by the church
Sanctified and blessed they set out
Crusaders, gentiles' scourge

They fight, they kill, they rape
Under the banner of the 'holy' church
They hunt, they lie, they cheat, they steal
Doing dirty deeds

Conquistadores - Hungry for gold
Doing as the religious madman told
Conquistadores - Religion's knights
Havoc and death caused by pride

Pearls of glass for ingots of gold
Violence, force and deceit
Taking the wealth or the Indian's life
Their way of feeding their greed
Heathen must turn to Christianity
It's like 'believe or die'
Arrogance and blindless, religion's force
Believers never ask the reason why
You might also like
They fight, they kill, they rape
Under the banner of the 'holy' church
They hunt, they lie, they cheat, they steal
Doing dirty deeds

Conquistadores - Hungry for gold
Doing as the religious madman told
Conquistadores - Religion's knights
Havoc and death caused by pride

Heathen must turn to Christianity
It's like 'believe or die'
Arrogance and blindless, religion's force
Believers never ask the reason why

They fight, they kill, they rape
Under the banner of the 'holy' church
They hunt, they lie, they cheat, they steal
Doing dirty deeds

Conquistadores - Hungry for gold
Doing as the religious madman told
Conquistadores - Religion's knights
Havoc and death caused by pride
Conquistadores - Hungry for gold
Doing as the religious madman told
Conquistadores - Religion's knights
Havoc and death caused by pride2Embed
