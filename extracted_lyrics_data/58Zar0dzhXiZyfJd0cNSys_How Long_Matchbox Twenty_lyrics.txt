6 ContributorsHow Long Lyrics
So many time with you and I
Thought it was right, but I was wrong, it's true
But I wouldn't feel the way I do
Without a sense of something real for you
And it's all about a good thing
So I don't mind holding on

But how long are you gonna make me wait?
And how long are you gonna hesitate?
'Cause l love the way we're carrying on, but baby how long?

You know the way they always say
Don't make it never, it's better late, well that's true
But tell me why, my cautious angel
Must you put it in my face like you do
And it's all about a good thing
So I don't mind holding on

But how long are you gonna make me wait?
And how long are you gonna hesitate?
'Cause l love the way we're carrying on
You might also like
But baby, I don't ever wanna make it feel too rushed
Make it feel like love wouldn't be enough
But that's just another don't mean much
Like a high school crush, make you wanna run
Can't you see the way I need you crazy
And I want you in my arms every night of my life

So tell me how long are you gonna make me wait?
And how long are you gonna hesitate?
'Cause l love the way we carry it on, but baby how long?

How long, how long
How long, how long
How long, tell me how longEmbed
