3 ContributorsPossessed by a Craft of Witchery LyricsAbducted by another freak of society
Two little pigs are snatched by the wolf
In this stone-cold reality
Tempted by the serpent in disguise
Poisoned by forbidden sweets
In a promised paradise
Built of lies
They are taken
Their hands tied to their backs
Their mouths taped shut
They awake in a concrete chamber
Stones instead of gingerbread
Two flies flew into a black sugar cobweb
By the scum of our own kind
This treacherous web has been spun
Numbered by fear they wait
For an aggressive hungry spider to appear
Too late to run away
They have been misled
No rooftop made of cake
No walls built of bread
Not even a glimpse of light
Is reaching inside
Neither from the sun
Nor from the moon
For these are no windows of clear sugar
Built in this dreary room
You might also likeThoughts of milk, pancakes with treacle
And warm beds draped with silk
A delicious promise has been broken
And the intention behind is of a malicious kind
This is no fairy-tale house
Surrounded by caramel flowers
In a chocolate garden of confectionery trees
This is the residence of a deranged psychopath
Who truly believes to be possessed
By a craft of witchery
He kills children in the name of a witch
A demonic voice compels him
To wander as a friendly clown
Searching in every town
Until flesh victims are found
The voice of the witch
Spits venomous words in his head
It can only be silenced
When infants are dead
Her ghost slithers
Like black fog down the chimney at night
Only he can see this tormenting parasite
Dragging the children from the cellar
Into a room equipped for ritual sacrifice
The walls are blotched with religious symbols
To glorify an infernal paradise
He locks the girl up in an iron cage
To witness her young brother's death
Now she will hear all his screams
Until he draws his last breath
The serial killer shackles the boy to the floor
Upon the sign of the witch
The children scream:
"No more!"
"Shut the fuck up!
I will now take his precious little life."
Whispering unholy rhymes
While holding a black-hilted knife
And he stabs like a maniac
Because the witch gave permission
To mutilate the child beyond recognitionEmbed
