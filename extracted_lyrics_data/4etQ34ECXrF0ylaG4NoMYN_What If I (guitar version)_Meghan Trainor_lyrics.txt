9 ContributorsWhat If I (Guitar Version) Lyrics
What if I, I wanna kiss you tomorrow?

Something tells me you're not like the other boys
Oh no, babe, oh no, babe, mmm
Of course I like you, can't you hear it in my voice?
Oh yeah, babe, oh yeah, babe, mmm

Well, don't be nervous
I'm so into you
Yes I am, babe
Is this is something, or am I just a fool?

What if I, I
I wanna kiss you tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow? Hey

'Cause you're the first guy who's taken me out
And has taken his time
Yes you are, babe
No, you ain't tryna get in my bed on the very first night

So what if I, mmm, I wanna kiss you tomorrow? (Babe, mmm)
So what if I (Come on)
I wanna kiss you tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow? (Ooh, hey)
