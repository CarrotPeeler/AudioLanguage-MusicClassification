1 ContributorMyself Lyrics
Yeah, lookin' to the future I can clearly see the past
Everybody's worried 'bout what they gotta' have
Wanna' have it now, they can never make it last
Start something but they never finish the task
Tryin' so hard to make all of this change
Wanna' stand up on top of every stage
Tell 'em money and the power doesn't come with all the fame
We forget about the work, want it handed to our name
This is Me vs. Me, I'm speakin' to everybody
But deep down I'm startin' to feel a little rocky
'Cause I'm talkin' to myself, goin' crazy like Bonnie
Lemme' tell you 'bout the hours of hustle within' my body
If you wanna' get it done, just ask for help
If you wanna' get it right, you're doin' all by yourself
But if you take too long then everything starts to melt
That's why everything I do, I'm doin' it by myself
Writin' all of these lyrics, doin' it by myself
Put 'em all on Genius, doin' it by myself
Singin,' rappin' and the music, I'm doin' it by myself
O-Brad got me on producin,' he's doin' it by himself
Put my music up on everything, doin' 'em by myself
Hours passin' in my room and I'm sittin' all by myself
I'm my manager, promoter, I'm doin' it all myself
Looks like everything I do, I'm doin' it by myself, yeah
You might also like
Uh, I'm just tryna' be different
I'm not tryna' be somebody that's ignorant
It's just that everybody now is so belligerent
They say they didn't mean it but its so deliberate
I feel everybody now has got their eyes on me
Let's take a moment of silence, yeah, you should take a knee
Bout' to make the album drop, that'll make it three
I'm bout' to blow their speakers up, I can guarantee
Chyeah, lemme' spit up on the mic, this Icicle very clean
They be lookin' at me funny like, "Jeff, what the fuck you mean?"
I'm like chill, chill, homie, I'm just tryna' get some green
Better realize that me and you, we on the same team
Yeah, I'm thinkin' nobody really will top my level
You ain't the only one, many people on the vessel
But I bet you think you're boy here is very special
I'm just sorry, man, nobody is on my level
Writin' all of these lyrics, doin' it by myself
Put 'em all on Genius, doin' it by myself
Singin,' rappin' and the music, I'm doin' it by myself
O-Brad got me on producin,' he's doin' it by himself
Put my music up on everything, doin' 'em by myself
Hours passin' in my room and I'm sittin' all by myself
I'm my manager, promoter, I'm doin' it all myself
Looks like everything I do, I'm doin' it by myself, yeah
I mean this shit don't even got a key
Alright
Okay, pre-bridge, might as well make somethin' that don't exist
Because the instrumental already has covered this
In case you forgot, didn't listen or even missed
This shit is in our own time, we ain't nobody's bitch
We don't need help, we got this business in the bag
We don't want help, we already the fuckin' man
I don't see anybody goin' to catch the pass
Only one of my kind which is pretty sad
Look me in the eyes, tell me what you see
You gon' see a young kid blessed without a sneeze
All my prayers have been answered upon my knees
Now the only thing left is just to make some cheese
I'm done askin' for help, I gotta' make my life shine
'Cause this life I'm livin' isn't yours, homie, this is mine
I'm sick of everything, everybody crossed the damn line
All my work will catch up and come to me over time
Only kid I trust to do it right is O-Brad with the heat
This kid's craft is so crisp, don't get me started with the beat
Maybe next album ya'll are gunna' see me with a feat
I don't make a promise unless it's one I know that I can keep
Put a glass in the air, time to toast to our success
Even when our scattered thoughts make a pretty big mess
We still give the definition of the very fucking best
You can separate your speakers, man, I'm feeling very blessed
Writin' all of these lyrics, doin' it by myself
Put 'em all on Genius, doin' it by myself
Singin,' rappin' and the music, I'm doin' it by myself
O-Brad got me on producin,' he's doin' it by himself
Put my music up on everything, doin' 'em by myself
Hours passin' in my room and I'm sittin' all by myself
I'm my manager, promoter, I'm doin' it all myself
Looks like everything I do, I'm doin' it by myself, yeah
Bet
Writin' all of these lyrics, doin' it by myself
Put 'em all on Genius, doin' it by myself
Singin,' rappin' and the music, I'm doin' it by myself
O-Brad got me on producin,' he's doin' it by himself
Put my music up on everything, doin' 'em by myself
Hours passin' in my room and I'm sittin' all by myself
I'm my manager, promoter, I'm doin' it all myself
Looks like everything I do, I'm doin' it by myself, yeah
Looks like everything I do, I'm doin' it by myself
Looks like everything I do, I'm doin' it by myselfEmbed
