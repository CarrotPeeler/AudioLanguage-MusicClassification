5 ContributorsTake It Back Lyrics:
"Alright that's enough now, we're going back"
"Going back?"
"Taking it back"

Yeah
Anyways
Let's talk about that back in the day shit
I know Wik remembers
Hey Bias, you remember?
Word 'em up
Is that Alzheimer's kickin' in bruv?
Respect your elders' son
Haha, yeah, yeah, anyways all that aside, man
Let's talk about them good old days
Take it

Back, Back when, way back
Rewind a minute reminisce to the days that
Make you wanna jump (Jump), make you wanna chill (Chill)
Coolin' out with your pals in the sun now
One for the treble (One for the treble)
Two for the kick (Two for the kick)
Three to get busy (Three to get busy)
Come on y'all, we're taking a trip
You might also like
Snapbacks and Adidas, snap away trackie-dacks
California gangs, fucking with a hacky sack
I take it back, back when
Living in the '90s think about the days when
Hyper colour cross colours was the shit
Cash of buck twenty'd getchya minimum chips
The internet was out, The NBA was in
Dubbin' up a mix-tape to give to your friends
Murder was the case that they gave me
I rep for D-O-double-G, 'cause I'm a '80s baby
Skatin' in the city, junkies on the prowl
Heroin in Melbourne everywhere, gettin' foul
Smokey Dokes, Big Boss, Coca-Cola Yo-Yo's
East Preston, West Heidy was a no-go
Remember Yogo or Aerosport?
Remember when your porn came in magazine form?
Creepin' all around just to get your dad's stash
Nowadays click a mouse, boom, check the gash
Banana Man, Super Tech, Cartoon Connection
Tucked up in my belt was a permanent erection (Hahaha)
I love pussy, it's all I ever think about
But back then man, it's all I ever lived about
TSF, MOS, TBS, TIK
DMA, DC, Wild Child-A
Back, Back when, way back
Rewind a minute reminisce to the days that
Make you wanna jump (Jump), make you wanna chill (Chill)
Coolin' out with your pals in the sun now
One for the treble (One for the treble)
Two for the kick (Two for the kick)
Three to get busy (Three to get busy)
Come on y'all, we're taking a trip

Greensborough weed (That's the shit!)
Backpacks were Caribee (That's the shit!)
Beezwax and Bias B (That's the shit!)
Speakin' of the man, kick it a bit
:
We had the rapper in the bucket hats, high top Adidas
With the laces fat, trains were trashed, lookin' for paint to rack
I take it back, back when
Ten pack of Peter Jacksons only cost a kid a dollar ten
Artline markers, Touch-Ups from Target
Carvin' up the skate park like Mark Gonzales
Run DMC and Derek B at Festival Hall
City square graffiti wall  the best of 'em all
Hursty was the place where they raised me
Greensborough, St. Helena, Montmorency, blazin' up daily
In the days of the '80s, Tuff Twos on your BMX
Warriors, Star Wars, Beat Street, Beta, VHS
Sega and Nintendo, O-zone and Turbo
When rappers had a jheri curl, I called it a perm though
'Cause that's what my mum and dad used to get (Hahaha)
And twenty cents of mixed lollies had me happy as a little kid
Dukes of Hazzard chips, Don Johnson on Miami Vice
Michael Jackson jackets in fashion, Michael J Fox on Family Ties
Mike Tyson was the champ then
And Public Enemy were Cold Cold Lampin' (Oh, shit)
Back when Scott La Rock got shot
And shit like Ross and New Kids on The Block were hot
Hop-swatch, acid-wash, kids pumping their Reeboks
K-Rob, Rem LZ, 1983 Be-bop
:
1983 Be-bop (on some Star Wars shit)
Man, it's like a time warp in here
How old do you think I am, man?
I can't even remember that shit
Come on, Maundz, I thought you was old school
You weren't even born
Hey that doesn't matter man
Man, why ya always gotta bust my chops
Anyway
Take it back
