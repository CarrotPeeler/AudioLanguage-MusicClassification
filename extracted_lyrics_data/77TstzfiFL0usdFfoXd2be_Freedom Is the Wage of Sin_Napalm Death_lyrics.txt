3 ContributorsFreedom Is the Wage of Sin LyricsMandated since none of them knew
How to transcend moral codes that are presumed
Unthinkable?
Inconceivable?
Cower in a corner and keep the heresy stowed
Freedom is the wage of sin
Freedom is the wage of sin
No universal force of influence
Should dictate behaviour that we can't handle ourselves
Freedom is the wage of sin
Freedom is the wage of sin
Permission, the abdication of our self-determination
Think, think for a minute
Of centuries of perpetuating
Bloodshed, deception, oppression
Bloodshed, deception, oppression
Bloodshed, deception, oppression
Think, think for a minute
Of centuries of subjugating
Martyr's superstitions

That intervention
Is not advancing or easing hardships
Still we're strangely so duty-bound
