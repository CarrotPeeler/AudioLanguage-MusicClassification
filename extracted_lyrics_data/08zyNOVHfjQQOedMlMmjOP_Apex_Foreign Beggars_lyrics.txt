8 ContributorsApex Lyrics(x2)
Set it off (set it off), set it up
You're at the front line, prone, and you're getting crushed
Ready to bust, mind blown when you think of us
About to turn your bloodline cold when we interrupt


Yeah, transmitting live from the apex
We got the reelfire shit for your tape decks
We bring the heat something messy like a splayed chest
Fully automatic how we sprayinâ€™ fam we staying blessed
We straight devil with the face set
Levelling the game makes you heavy like a bayonet
I keep it patient like I'm playing chess
Even though we barely keep on slaving like away a debt
We breaking necks like the world series
Other rappers sweating bullets as I burn millies
I keep it gully while I'm running for my life blood
Every minute waiting is a minute I can earn silly
And I ain't talking about cash flow
I'd par your swag in a flash if I was mad broke
It's Foreign Beggars, stepping up to the plate
While they destined to be spending oblivion in a black hole
You might also like
You don't wanna fuck with me
No, you don't wanna fuck with me
Wa-wanna with me
No-no, you don't wanna with me


Raw, the manor how we came as a team
Whole stees go against the grain of the scene
The jagged-edge flow cuts deep like a serrated blade
Sawing through your industry doors come on we're crazy cray
We're at the midnight hour, causing upheaval
Silhouettes in the black light, I still see you
Emerging out of the depths, it's brought that gutter sound
Full speed, leading the wolf pack across the town
It's Foreign Beggars yeah, showing no teeth
We roll so deep of that Agent O speech
Spitting projectiles flows the 'go go' scene
My big red button destroys the whole globe reach
That's the motif, so sleek, mo' heat
Ink stains blot out the sun when they soak sheets
It's that gully grip live off the mothership
Only one question to ask, you wanna fuck with this?3Embed
