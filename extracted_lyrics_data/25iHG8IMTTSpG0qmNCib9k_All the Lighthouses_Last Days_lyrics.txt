1 ContributorKeeping the Lighthouse LyricsThese last hundreds days
You've kept away from here
I begged you to stay
But still you leave my dear
Day turns to night
In this tomb all alone
I'm keeping the lighthouse
To guide you back home
I'll guide you back home
You alone
Those words that you said
They wound deep and they sear
This infliction of exile
I feel is too severe
Affection morphs into knives
And you stab at will
This perversion of love
All that you deal
I'll guide you back home
You aloneYou might also likeEmbed
