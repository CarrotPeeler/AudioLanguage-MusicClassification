1 ContributorBlame Me (Don’t Blame My Heart) Lyrics
Don't get tired, I hope I'm not bugging you
It's just my worrisome ways, I'm trying to keep loving you
And if I seem like I'm fallin' apart

Blame me, oh darling
And don't blame my heart, oh-woah

If someone tells you that you look good, now
And offer to take you out, oh
The place that I wish I could, now
Now I might get a little jealous, baby
And think life seems a little hard now, come
Take it out on me, baby
Please, please don't blame my heart

I know on the outside it seems I don't love you
But I taught you different by the way I kiss and hug you
So baby, wipe away your tears, now
Oh, just before they stop

Blame mе, oh darling (Lord have mercy)
And don't blame my hеart, oh baby
You might also like
If someone tell you that you look good, now
And offer to take you out, oh
The place that I wish I could, now
Now I might get a little jealous, baby
And think life seems a little hard now, come on
Take it out on me, baby
Please, please don't blame my heart

I know on the outside it seems I don't love you
But I taught you different by the way I kiss and hug you
And oh lord, baby wipe away your tears, now
Oh, just before they stop

Blame me, oh darling
And don't blame my heart, oh baby (Baby)
Blame me, oh darling
And don't blame my heart, oh (Yeah-yeah)

Blame me, lord have mercy
And don't blame my heartEmbed
