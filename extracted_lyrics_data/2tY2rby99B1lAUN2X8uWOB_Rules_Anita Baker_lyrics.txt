3 ContributorsRules Lyrics
Love was meant to be loving
So many times we don't give, we take
Love has really no conception of this rule
Days you gave me were numbered
And as a rule they were hard to take
All it took was the number of a fool

Rules were made to be broken (Rules were made to be)
So many hearts break the same way too
Ah, baby
I said that you ain't no exception to the rule
Yes, sir

Your answer begging my question
It seems I left you too late to ask
Was this really your intention from the start?
The nights you left me are empty, baby
As for the answer that changed the past
I tried to let you explain your change of heart
How could you change your mind?

Rules were made to be broken (Rules were made to be)
So many hearts break the same way, too
Ah, honey
I said that you ain't no exception to the rule
You might also like
Now, tell me, how could you say
It would be better this way
Without you
When by the usual rules
I kept presuming that you would stay with me, baby

(Rules were made to be)
So many hearts break the same way too
Now, mister
I said that you ain't no exception to the rule

You...gonna get on my bad heart
(Rules were made to be)
Just like everybody asks you
(No exception to the rule)
You've got a heart, baby
You've got a heart that can break too
(Rules were made to be)
You better hear what I'm telling you
(No exception to the rule)Embed
