I can hear you, I can hear you, lying
I can see you, I can see you, faking
I don't think you're, I don't think you're, working

I want you to
I want you to, I want you to
Write for me, and only me
A really extra special story
Make it mine, every line
Don't make me sorry
It's what I want, it's what I want
And I'll tell you what
You know me, and I can be
A very, very vicious critic

Another fan's appreciation
A do-be, don't-be situation
Drag me down into your hatred

Misery loves company
I'm your number one fan
Misery loves company, misery
Misery loves company
I'm your number one fan
Misery loves company
Misery loves company
Misery loves company
Misery loves company
Die with me!

I'll take good care, I'll take great care of you
Listen to me, listen to me you fool
Body and soul, body and soul, you're mind

I want you to
I want you to, I want you to
Write for me, and only me
A really extra special story
Make it mine, every line
Don't make me sorry
It's what I want, it's what I want
And I'll tell you what
You know me, and I'll show you
How to keep your filthy mouth shut

Another fan's appreciation
A do-be, don't-be situation
Drag me down into your hatred

Misery loves company

Die with me!
Take, take, take, take, another pound of my flesh
I'm giving blood
You, you, you, you, should only have the best
I'm giving blood


What the hell is, what the hell is happening?
I'm the one that made you into the king
Don't turn your back on, turn your back on, my help
I'll kill you, I'll kill you, I will
I'll kill you, I'll kill you, I'll kill

Write for me, and only me
A really extra special story
Make it mine, every line
Don't make me sorry
It's what I want, it's what I want
And I'll tell you what
You know me, and I can be
A very, very vicious critic

Drag me down into your hatred
