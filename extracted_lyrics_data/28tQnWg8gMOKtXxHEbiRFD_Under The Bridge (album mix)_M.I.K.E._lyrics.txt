1 ContributorCanâ€™t Take It Lyrics
I'm tired of talking big, let's just mix a bit
Why do you want fame, if you wanna stay the same?
Don't try to impress them, just be good at what you can
If you wanna follow the program, then just be insane
It's the start of the song, and it's already a classic
I guarantee you that the spread will be massive
On this one, I won't even try to give a message
I'll just try to make it loud like a New York traffic
Ok, I can admit, I don't know how to freestyle
But if you give me hours, guaranteed that's gon' be wild
'cause with these rhymes I give, I can ignite the crowd
And once I did that, all the people going to be loud
Started this now, going to be hard to slow me down
On the top of my game, let me just show you around
This beat is so much fire, feeling like Gold Beach weather
And don't even try to touch it, you'll be treated just like feather
I suggest you call your homies so you can all stick together
'cause trynna battle me is as cheese as cheddar
I'll make you scratch your rhymes, make you trynna do better
If you want me to help ya, I can give you some ladders
So you can get as high as me, and this won't even matter
Cuz you will be a Kwame Brown and I will be Chris Webber
I know that with this song, will be a pressure I created
But this fact won't even bother me, there's nothing I can't take it
So
You might also like
Soul food, it's the thing that all the songs should bring
That's why I prefer Logic's album over Hotline Bling
Come ask me for a song and I'll say I can make it
Just tell me all the records that I still didn't break it
On a chilling feeling of suspecting that I'm already faded
Or on that crazy persona just like Slim Shady
You want me to ghostwrite you, all you need is give me credit
'cause you think that you just gonna sing it and fuck it, I won't let it
It's not so hard to make it, it's just to see if you can take it
If you can't handle the pressure, then don't even try to fake it
CJ just made a beat, it's time to see if I can slay it
This one already did it, so just go ahead and play it
Sleeping on my talents like a Geography class
I'm feeling on the 90's with that N-A-S
No problem, 'cause with these lyrics I think I have a pass
Don't even try to play with me, I don't go to recess
The mess that was made it in this can't no more be deleted
They bleeding, with this sick album, look more like a routine
Of streak killing 'em all, 'cause this will be a murder case
If you can't keep up the pace
The monster is now getting out the cage
You overacting your game, I'll call you a second Nicolas Cage
You better not try to rage on me
'cause if you do I'm about to turn into the next page
And you will be past just like age
Go back and forth changing the flow
I'm under the radar, on the low
I'm just a younger trynna live the dream of the most
It must be a humble way as a whole
And I just keep the same as I keep flowing through the end of this killer song
Just like a dealer that keep selling his dope
I'll keep recording and mixing until the day that there's no hope
I got you on my scope, and with my periscope, I can see from the above, and you can tell that my success is very closeEmbed
