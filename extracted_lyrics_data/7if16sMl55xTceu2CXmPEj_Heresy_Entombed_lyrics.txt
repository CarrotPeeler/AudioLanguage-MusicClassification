1 ContributorHeresy LyricsAll you deity wannabes
With all your hearsay heresies
You lie to everyone
You want to be the sun
You want the world to kneel
Hearsay heresy
Deity wannabe
Liar – it's plain to see
Liar – it's you and me
Liar – and I won't kneel
You're not the only one
You're not the holy son
You're not trinity
Hearsay heresy
Deity wannabe
Crucifixion so absurd
It's time to thin the herd
Fuck your word
The problem with religion
Is that it's full of lice
That suck the blood
And marrow
Out through it's bleeding eyes
Spare me your contradiction
And hearsay heresies
The word is Crucifixion
And pervert reveries
The world is full of vermin
Pathetic wannabes
Who knows there's
Something out there
Spare me your prophecies
You smell
There's something rotten
And everybody knows
But when you
Cut the grass to see
Only the scapegoat show
The snakes are all in heaven
That's how the story goes
And when the grass is cut
(Surprise)
Only the dead shakes show
You might also likeLiar, liar
And everybody knows
Liar, liar
Dynasty in blasphemy
Deity wannabes
It's time to thin the herd
Crucifixion remedy
Hearsay heresy
Dynasty in blasphemy
Deity wannabes
It's time to thin the herd
Crucifixion remedy
Hearsay heresyEmbed
