A model... Used to be a role model
I dunno
Come on, Chelsea!
I dunno
Come on (Uh-huh)
Ah, go ahead now, Chelsea! Go ahead now!
This for Jersey right here
Go ahead now!
(Ah, ah, ah, ah)

Chelsea Rodgers was a model
Though she really rocked the role, yes, she did
Kept her tears up in her, bottled
Poured them out to save your soul

Ask her what she liked the most
She said, she liked to talk to Jimi's ghost, ow
Fantasy or bragger's boast (This girl is fly)
Chelsea's fly, like coast to coast (Mmm)
Hollywood or Times Square
If the party's fly, my girl is there (yes, she is)
Earth boots on and flowers in her hair
21st Century hippy, Chelsea don't care
You might also like
Chelsea Rodgers was a model
Thought she really rocked her role, yes, she did
Kept her tears up in a bottle
Poured them out to save her soul

Try to catch her if you can (Come on now together)
But you never see her with one man (Uh, a brother got to jump in the water)
He must be baptized, according to the master plan
Before she give up the good thang
Go ahead, Chelsea! (Go ahead, Chelsea!)
No cut diamonds, and designer shoes (Uh, no-no)
'Cause she's too original from her head down to her feet
(Rehab) (If you want to) Chelsea don't eat no meat
Still got butt like a leather seat
Go ahead, Chelsea! (Go ahead, Chelsea!)

Chelsea Rodgers was a model
Plus she really rocked her role, yes, she did
She kept her tears up in a bottle
Poured them out to save a soul

Go ahead, Chelsea!
(Speak on it horns)
Come on
Next to her they just a fool
Chelsea read more books than a few
Moses was a Pharaoh in the 18th Dynasty
And Mo' was chilling in Carthage in 33 BCE
And the day that we stop counting, we live as long as a tree
Go ahead, Chelsea, teach me! Go ahead, Chelsea
Make a promise to your higher self
And get true knowledge then fame and wealth
You don't be chasing nobody's ghost
Of everything, make the most (Come on)

Chelsea Rodgers was a model
Thought she really rocked her role
Kept her tears up in her, bottled, yes, she did
Poured them out to save your soul

Chelsea Rodgers was a model
Thought she really rocked her role, yes, she did
Kept her tears up in her, bottled
Poured them out to save your soul

Shake it like a Juicy Juice
Shake it like a Juicy Juice
Shake it like a Juicy Juice
Shake it like a Juicy Juice
Chelsea Rodgers was a model
Thought she really rocked the role
Kept her tears up in her, bottled
Poured them out to save her soul
Chelsea Rodgers was a model
Poured them out to save her soulEmbed
