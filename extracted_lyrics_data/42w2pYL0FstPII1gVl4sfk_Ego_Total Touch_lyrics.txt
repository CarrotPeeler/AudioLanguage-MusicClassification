1 ContributorEgo LyricsYou've never been straight with me
Even up to this day
What is it you wanted from me?
What kind of game did you play?
Your split personality
Has turned me inside out
You promised honesty
But gave me lies 'n' doubts
You told me you loved me
But all my trust you betrayed
I lost my dignity
Why did you take that from me?
You told me you wanted me
I don't need none of that crap
You took it all out on me
I felt abused - I was trapped
Chorus
It is so easy to go
And cut me with your ego
I cannot take no more
What did you do that for?
Now you've got no place to go
You will hear me on the radio
I am worth caring for
What do you take me for?
I took you by surprise
You didn't know what to say
You could not look in my eyes
Your conscience got in the way
Don't act pathetic 'n' dumb
'cause now it's much too late
Justice will be done
I've got no time to waste
You stole my smile from me
And left me stuck with your shit
My body still remembers
All the things that you did
You didn't hear me cry
But now it's time that you know
How much you've hurt me inside
It's much too easy to go
You messed up - all your chances you blew
The game is up
I'm through with you
I'm by myself and I'm much better off
'cause now I know
I'll save my love for someone else!
