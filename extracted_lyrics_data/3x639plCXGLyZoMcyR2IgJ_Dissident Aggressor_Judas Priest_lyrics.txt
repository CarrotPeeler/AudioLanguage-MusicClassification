13 ContributorsDissident Aggressor Lyrics
Grand canyons of space and time universal
My mind is subjected, subjected to all

Stab!
Bawl!
Punch!
Crawl!
Hooks to my brain are well in
Stab!
Bawl!
Punch!
Crawl!
I know what I am, I'm Berlin

Through cracked, blackened memories of unit dispersal
I face the impregnable wall

Stab!
Bawl!
Punch!
Crawl!
Hooks to my brain are well in
Stab!
Bawl!
Punch!
Crawl!
I know what I am, I'm Berlin

Exploding, reloading, this quest never-ending
Until I give out my last breath

I'm stabbing
And bawling
I'm punching
And crawling
Hooks to my brain are well in
I'm stabbing
And bawling
I'm punching
And crawling
I know what I am, I'm Berlin2Embed
