24 ContributorsBad Company Lyrics
Mmm

Company always on the run
Destiny is a rising sun
Oh
I was born six-gun in my hand
Behind a gun
I'll make my final stand, hey
That's why they call me

Bad company
And I can't deny
Bad company
'Til the day I die, oh
'Til the day I die
'Til the day I die

Rebel souls
Deserters we are called
Chose a gun
And threw away the sword
Now these towns
They all know our name
Six-gun sound is our claim to fame
I can hear them say
You might also like
Bad company
And I won't deny
Bad, bad company
'Til the day I die
Oh, yeah
'Til the day I die
Ooh, ooh, ooh


Hey, hey, hey
Bad company
I can't deny
Bad company
'Til the day I die
What'd I say now?
It's bad company
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
Bad company
'Til the day I die
Woah, yeah

Said I'm young and I'm free
Oh, but I'm-a bad company
That's the way I play, yeah
Dirty for dirty, heh
Oh, somebody double-cross me
Double-cross for double-cross
Yeah, we're bad company
Oh, the cold wind blowing, ah
Mmm yeah7Embed
