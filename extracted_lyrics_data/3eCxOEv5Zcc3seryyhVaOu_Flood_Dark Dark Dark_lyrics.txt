They're filled with taconite, oh
Oh, your back, the slightest curve
You feel the weight of it all
La da da dum da dum
Oh, your feet, they shuffle around
Like you packed your body with sand
To keep the rains back
Oh, your feet, they shuffle around
You feel the weight of it all
When you feel the weight of it all
Oh, you dance the saddest dance
But you're dancing, you're dancing it all
La da da dum da dum
Oh, you dance the saddest dance
You feel the weight of it all
When you feel the weight of it all
You feel the weight of it all
But you might go
Up and away
Watch you move through the earth
Moving like light
But you might go
Up and away
Watch you move through the earth
Moving like light
You might also likeLet your thoughts go
Let them move you
Move through the earth
Moving like light
Let your thoughts go
Let them move you
Move through the earth
Moving like lightEmbed
