15 ContributorsI Love You More Than You’ll Ever Know Lyrics
If I ever leave you baby, you can say I told you so
And if I ever hurt you, you know I hurt myself as well

Is that any way for a man to carry on?
Do you think I want my loved one gone?
Said I love you
More than you'll ever know
More than you'll ever know

When I wasn't making much money
You know where my paycheck went
You know I brought it home to you baby
And I never spent a red cent, hey

Is that any way for a man to carry on?
Do you think I want my loved one gone?
Said I love you
More than you'll ever know
Yeah, more than you'll ever know
Now listen to this

I'm not trying to be
Just any kind of man, no I ain't
I'm just trying to be somebody
You can love, trust, and understand
I know, I know, I know that I can be
A part of you that no one else could see, yeah
But I’ve got to hear you say, I've got to hear you say
It's all right
You might also like
I'm only flesh and blood
But I can be anything that you demand
I can be king of everything
Or just a tiny grain of sand

Now tell me, is that any way for a man to carry on?
Do you think that I want my loved one gone?
I love you more than you'll ever know
I said I love you, I love you, I love you
Hey, I don't want nobody else
I don't need nobody else
I just want you6Embed
