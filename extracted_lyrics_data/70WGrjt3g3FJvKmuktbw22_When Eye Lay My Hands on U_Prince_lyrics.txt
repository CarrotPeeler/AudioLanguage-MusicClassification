7 ContributorsWhen Eye Lay My Hands On U Lyrics
The message you're about to hear is not meant for transmission
Should only be accessed in the privacy of your mind
Words are intense so my dear if you dare to listen
Take off your clothes
And Meet me between the lines

Are you ready for the touch that makes you go insane
Breast to lips to cheek to mane
I'll pull your hair, you'll feel no pain
Are you ready for the only forever we'll both obtain
The only joy in this forsaken game
You'll feel ashamed and ordained
When I lay my hands on you

The touch you're about to feel is the one you've been wishin' for
It's been here like an echo inside your space and time
It's about to get freaky cause the places that I'll be kissin'
Are the places that no other man could ever find
Oh wind up ready for

The touch that makes you go insane
Breast to lips to cheek to mane
I'll pull your hair, you'll feel no pain
Are you ready for the only forever we'll both obtain
The only joy in this forsaken game (God forbid)
You'll feel ashamed and ordained (God forbid)
When I lay my hands on you
You might also like
Nobody knows
Like God knows
Where the deepest part of your river flows
Snap Snap
Undo these nylon hose
Around your thigh my finger goes slowly
Like a cat tip-toes
Until I reach the capstone
I will touch thee in the softest manner
Like "Europa" in the hands of Santana

Are you ready for the touch that makes you go insane
Breast to lips to cheek to mane
I'll pull your hair, you'll feel no pain
Are you ready for the only forever we'll both obtain
The only joy in this forsaken game
You'll feel ashamed and ordained
When I lay my hands on you
When I lay my hands on you1Embed
