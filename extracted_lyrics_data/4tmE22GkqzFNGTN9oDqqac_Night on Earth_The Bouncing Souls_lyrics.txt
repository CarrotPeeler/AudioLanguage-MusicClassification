4 ContributorsNight on Earth Lyrics
Passed some time on the stoop
On the block were we used to sit
I thought about it all too much
I thought so hard I couldn't see
Pete rode by on his Hutch

Passed some time on the stoop
On the block were we used to sit
I looked down and tied my shoes
I thought about you all too much
I looked up and then I knew

I guess these things were meant to be
And there's no use fighting what's in me

Night on earth
Night on earth

Passed some time walking around
Looking for something to be
When I stopped to look around
All the music was different to me
See The Bouncing Souls LiveGet tickets as low as $35You might also like
All these places we used to go
When I loved you, I didn't see
I'll miss you, but now I'll know
Better next time, 'cause I found me

I guess these things were meant to be
And there's no use fighting what's in me

Night on earth
Night on earthEmbed
