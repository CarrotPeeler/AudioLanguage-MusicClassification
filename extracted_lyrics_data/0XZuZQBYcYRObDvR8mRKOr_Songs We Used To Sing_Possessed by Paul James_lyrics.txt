3 ContributorsSongs We Used To Sing Lyrics
You call my name and I come running over to you
Just like a fool, oh normally does
You look too good for me to be standing in your shadow
Let's turn up the music, ah here comes the drum, the drum, the drum, the drum

Oh, the songs, we used to sing of better days or once in our lives
These are the songs we used to sing, so don't forget about it
These are the songs we used to sing some of the good, oh and most of the bad
These are the songs we used to sing, so don't forget about it
These are the songs we used to sing, so don't forget about it

You take my hand and jump in off the coast of California
Way down below, oh beyond my control
You look too good for me to be, oh standing in your shadow
Let's turn up the music, ah here comes the drum, the drum, the drum, the drum

Oh, the songs we used to sing some of the good times and most of the bad
These are the songs we used to sing, so don't forget about it
These are the songs we used to sing of better days or once in our lives
These are the songs we used to sing, so don't forget about it
These are the songs we used to sing, so don't forget about it
You might also like
I stand here alone in my bed, holding to a memory
Your touch and your smell, oh I'm losing my mind
You look too good for me to be, oh standing in your shadow
Let's turn up the music, ah here comes the drum, the drum, the drum, the drum

Oh, the songs we used to sing of better days or once in our lives
These are the songs we used to sing, so don't forget about it
These are the songs we used to sing some of the good times and most of the bad
These are the songs we used to sing, so don't forget about it
These are the songs we used to sing, so don't forget about it
These are the songs we used to sing, so don't forget about itEmbed
