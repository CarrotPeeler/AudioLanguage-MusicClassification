Moyuba Echumingua y los ibeyis
Moyuba Oshun Shango and Yemaya

We hear laughter and we think of you
We walk on rhythm and we think of you
Feeling our union and we think of you
Receive your spirit and we think of you

Moyuba Echumingua y los ibeyis
Moyuba Oshun Shango and Yemaya

Let's remember with rhythm our loved ones that are gone
All the joy when we're singing that no spell can destroy

We hear laughter and we think of you
We walk on rhythm and we think of you
Feeling our union and we think of you
Receive your spirit and we think of you

Moyuba Oshun Shango and Yemaya

If we sing they may come guiding all of our steps
You're living through us Baba we're singing for you

We hear laughter and we think of you
We walk on rhythm and we think of you
Feeling our union and we think of you
Receive your spirit and we think of you
