1 ContributorShown Through Your Eyes LyricsI'm Only Shown Through Your Eyes Girl
There's Going Be A Time
Where You Gonna Need My Love
Nobody Would See Me
But I Can Be Only Shown Through Your Eyes
I'm Only Shown Through Your Eyes Girl
It's About The Reflection
And The Connection
There's Going Be A Time
Where You Gonna Need My Love
Nobody Would See Me
But I Can Be Only Shown Through Your Eyes
I'm Only Shown Through Your Eyes Girl
It's About The Reflection
And The Connection
You Know I'm There
But They Don't Know I'm Here
Like I'm A Ghost To Them
People Think Your Crazy
But Don't Worry About That
I Said Don't Worry About That Girl
There's Going Be A Time
Where You Gonna Need My Love
Nobody Would See Me
But I Can Be Only Shown Through Your Eyes
I'm Only Shown Through Your Eyes Girl
It's About The Reflection
And The Connection
There's Going Be A Time
Where You Gonna Need My Love
Nobody Would See Me
But I Can Be Only Shown Through Your Eyes
I'm Only Shown Through Your Eyes Girl
It's About The Connection
And The Reflection
When We're Driving Down The S.S.C
People Will Think The Invisible Man Is Driving
Only They Know That
But You Know I'm Here
You Think They're Crazy
I Just Said (They're Just Trippin')
But Don't Worry About That
Just Worry That
There's Going Be A Time
Where You Gonna Need My Love
Nobody Would See Me
But I Can Be Only Shown Through Your Eyes
I'm Only Shown Through Your Eyes Girl
It's About The Reflection
And The Connection
There's Going Be A Time
Where You Gonna Need My Love
Nobody Would See Me
But I Can Be Only Shown Through Your Eyes
I'm Only Shown Through Your Eyes Girl
It's About The Reflection
