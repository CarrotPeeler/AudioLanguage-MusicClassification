We were at the beach (Eww)
Everybody had matching towels (Eww)
Somebody went under a dock (Eww)
And there they saw a rock (Eww)
It wasn't a rock (Eww)
Was a rock lobster (Eww)

Lobster, rock
Lobster, rock
Let's rock

Boys in bikinis
Girls in surfboards
Everybody's rocking
Everybody's fruging
Twisting around the fire, having fun
Baking potatoes, baking in the sun
Put on your nose guard
Put on the lifeguard
Pass the tanning butter
Here comes a stingray (Ooh-wah, ooh-wah)
There goes a manta ray (Ah, ah, ah)
In walked a jellyfish
There goes a dogfish
Chased by a catfish
In flew a sea robin (La)
Watch out for that piranha
There goes a narwhal
Here comes a bikini whale (Ah)
Rock lobster (Lobster, rock lobster)
Rock lobster (Lobster, ah-ah-ah-ah)
Rock lobster (Lobster, rock lobster)
Rock lobster (Lobster, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah8Embed
