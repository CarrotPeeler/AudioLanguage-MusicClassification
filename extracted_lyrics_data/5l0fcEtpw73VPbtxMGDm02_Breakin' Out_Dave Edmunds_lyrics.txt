2 ContributorsBreaking Out LyricsI knew it all along
The party's over
It's been fun
If it's true what the people say
Then it won't take your breath away
To know one day soon I'm gonna be breaking out
And now can you come pain
A one way ticket to another game
Your feelings never change
A can slow motion and back again
If it's true what the people say
Then I won't take too much of your day
It's just a one day soon I'm gonna be breaking out
Breaking out
Breaking out
Breaking out
Breaking out
Breaking out
Breaking out
You might also likeA feeling never shown
It's blown to pieces it's before it's grown
And as you walk alone
Remember me, I was the one
If it's true what the people say
Then it's time for the winner to pay
Whoa I believe I'm gonna be breaking out
Breaking out
Breaking out
Breaking out
(The secret's out we'll never see the light of day, deny it)
Breaking out
Breaking out
Breaking out
(No one will ever know the stories that can't be told, deny it)
Emotion that has changed
They say one day we'll bring the rain
How can it be the same
One day you'll never know my name
If it's true what the people say
And it's time for the end of the play
No girl at home, I'm gonna be breaking out
Breaking out
Breaking out
