1 ContributorLight Worker Lyrics
It ain't easy liven right when you fucking with the light
People wanna bring you down they don't understand the light
Cause the love inside of me always shining really bright
When I'm touching on the keys spiritually I'm taking flight (x2)

What you believe to be fake to me ain't fables
What you believe on TV programming cable
They got you so deceived sitten at the table
Now they killen you like Cain had done to Abel
Time to tell the truth lay it on the table
Followin my route & I don't need a label
I speak from my heart balanced very stable
Wisdom full of smarts, disattached no staples
Protected from above connected to my angles
Dr. strange on my journey like it's Nepals
Overcoming fears, Cincinnati Bengals
Durga with the sphere protecting every angle
Look inside of self silver-cord is tangled
Spirit shouts for help it takes 2 to tango
Prosperity, symbolism of the mango
Clarity, powerful and swift like arrows

It ain't easy liven right when you fucking with the light
People wanna bring you down they don't understand the light
Cause the love inside of me always shining really bright
When I'm touching on the keys spiritually I'm taking flight (x2)

Spiritually taking flight to the astral plane
DMT becomes released right inside my brain
Fear an illusion there's no such thing as pain
Feel your body start to tingle consciously remain
In the moment just wait please let me explain
I know it's hard to perceive, I'm not insane
Let's remain judgement, free please refrain
From projecting insecurities don't be ashamed
Energy so precious like exotic strains
Time to release barriers, saw off the chain
Watch yourself go to sleep in a deep trance
Be clear about intent, to enhance
Imagination visualize to increase your chance
Sensations got your body feeling numb
Heart beats rather deep like a bass drum
Now we're making progress, we're almost done
Remain conscious of breathe here it comes
Separation of the light body from one
Inter-dimensional connection, this is fun
Subconscious brain inferior to none
Out of body experience has begun
Expansion of awareness at a new high
Communication now available with spirit guides
Fear the ultimate illusion embrace the ride
It ain't easy liven right when you fucking with the light
People wanna bring you down they don't understand the light
Cause the love inside of me always shining really bright
When im touching on the keys spiritually I'm taking flight (x2)Embed
