9 ContributorsWhat We Do Lyrics
Sometimes things get in the way
My thoughts I cannot convey
It's all pointing straight at you
We hate loving every day
Our lives swirled in every way
I give it all back to you

I can help this going down

I can't take this
All my life is reckless
All our lies are dangerous
But we fake our way through, that's what we do
We do

Sometimes things don't go away
In time, you just run away
It's all coming back for you
Betrayed, life is in decay
Your thoughts you cannot obey
Right now, what you gonna do?

I can help this going down

I can't take this
All my life is reckless
All our lies are dangerous
But we fake our way through, that's what we do
We do, we do, we do, we do
We do, we do, we do, we do, we do

I hear the calling of the helpless stranger
He's all alone, and no one gets his anger
I feel his pain every time I'm here with you, with you
All the heartache and the fucked up insults
I find you begging on your knees, I figured
This is how it's supposed to be with you, with you
I can't wait for your lies to be broken down
I gave you hell

I can't take this
All my life is reckless
All our lies are dangerous
But we fake our way through, that's what we do
I can't take this
All my life is reckless
All our lies are dangerous
But we fake our way through, that's what we do4Embed
