1 ContributorTime Travelling Blues LyricsOh baby
My time has come
I'm gonna step aboard this ship today
And head for the sun
Don't know what I'll see there
Don't know what I'll find
Baby I'll be happy if I
Find my peace of mind
Time travel
It's been getting me down
I've been gone so long
I don't ever think I'm coming down
I've seen tomorrow, and I've
Seen yesterday
Will I see your face again, oh baby
You know I just can't say
Oh no, no
No I just can't say
Baby, I'm comin down
I'm comin down
No I just can't say, baby
That I'm comin down
Where I'm comin down
Oh won't you take me away, baby?
Take me away, away, away, yeah

Will we ride the sky?
Will we find tomorrow, baby?
Will we travel time?
Will we see the sunshine, baby?
Will we ride the sky?
Will we find tomorrow, baby?
Will we travel time?
We own the sun
We own the sky
We own tomorrow
And we wanna fly... (repeat verse x 13)Embed
