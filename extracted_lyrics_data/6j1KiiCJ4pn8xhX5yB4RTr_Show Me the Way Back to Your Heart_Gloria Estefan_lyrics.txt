4 ContributorsShow Me The Way Back To Your Heart LyricsI remember days nights were never cold
I had you in my life
I had you here to hold
And I remember love warm as a summer day
But I lost you
And I lost my way
Now I'm in the rain
Begging you please, please
Baby won't you show me the way back to your heart
Let me see a sign to know if i'm close or far
Lead me back to the road that leads back to your arms
To your arms
Every night another lonely street I walk down alone
Searching for a light
Your light to lead me home
Leave a candle in the window
And let it shine for me
Take my hand and take these tears away
I can't take the pain
I'm on my knees, please
Baby won't you show me the way back to your heart
Let me see a sign to know if I'm close or far
Lead me back to the road that leads back to your arms
To your arms
You might also likeTake my hand and take me in your arms
I'm out in the dark
Down on my knees, please
Show me the way back to your heart
Let me see a sign to know if I'm close or far
Lead me back to the road that leads back to your arms
To your arms
To your arms
To your armsEmbed
