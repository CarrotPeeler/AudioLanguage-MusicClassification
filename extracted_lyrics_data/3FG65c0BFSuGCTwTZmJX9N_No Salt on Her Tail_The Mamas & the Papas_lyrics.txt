Not in my arms (La-la-la-la)
But on my mind (La-la-la-la)
Yes, on my mind (La-la-la-la)
But not in my arms

Time passes by (Time passes by)
And I watch her fly (And I watch her fly)
Yes, I watch her fly (Yes, I watch her fly)
And time passes by

Though it's hard for me
I'm going to leave her free
'Cause that would be the best philosophy
Then she'll come to me (Come to me)
So I feel that to be real, that

This little bird (Bird)
She can fly away (She can fly away)
No salt on her tail (No salt on her tail)
No cage to make her stay
(No cage to make her stay)
You might also like
Though it's hard for me
I'm going to leave her free
'Cause that would be the best philosophy
She'll come to me
So I feel that to be real

This little bird
She can fly away (She can fly away)
No salt on her tail (No salt on her tail)
Now she can fly away

(No cage to make her stay)
No cage to make her stay
(No cage to make her stay)
This little bird can fly away
(No cage to make her stay)
(No cage to make her stay)Embed
