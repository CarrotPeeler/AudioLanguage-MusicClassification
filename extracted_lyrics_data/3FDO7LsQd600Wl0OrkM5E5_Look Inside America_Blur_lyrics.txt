25 ContributorsLook Inside America Lyrics
Good morning lethargy
Drink Pepsi, is good for energy
The bath's on, smoke in the bedroom
Sore throat and on my neck, a nasty bruise
And where it came from, well, I don't know
But we played last night, it was a good show
Got the play out, second rate chat show
It's a nationwide deal, so you gotta go
Chuck from the company says it'll be alright
Got an ad on KROQ and there's an in-store tonight

Well, I build things up and then I let them go
Gotta get time share on the radio

Look inside America
She's alright, she's alright
Sitting out the distance
But I'm not trying to make her mine
Looking for America
With its kooky nights and suicide
Where the TV says it's alright
'Cause everybody's hung up on something or other

Stepping off in 20, so the driver says
I should sleep tonight, but I think I'll watch videos instead
Annie Hall leaves New York in the end
Press rewind and Woody gets her back again

And the whole world could pass through me
But I don't know if it means much to me

Look inside America
She's alright, she's alright
Sitting out the distance
But I'm not trying to make her mine
I'm looking for America
With its kooky nights and suicide
Where the TV says it's alright
'Cause everybody's strung out on something or other

And the whole world could pass through me
But I don't know if it means much to me8Embed
