1, 2, 3 in the communauty
A, B, C, D we are three bad DJ's

Sit uppon the riddim like a king on a throne
Sit uppon the riddim man you know we control
Sit uppon the riddim like a king on a throne
Sit uppon the riddim man you know we control
The rub-a-dub style come and invest the area
Everybody love this style and now me i tell you
Said it was born in Kingston, Jamaica
And this style that me need love and me love
Nuff respect to the Africans
And them who come from thes Caribeans
Cause this is a murder style me love
The reggae music a go kill them all

Cause we are ruff and rugged

Everyone are know that education is the key
Man, we got only one sun for everybody
