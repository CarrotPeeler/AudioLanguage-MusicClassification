2 ContributorsYou LyricsAnd I flew over the world to be with you
Flew over the seas to be with you
I flew over the world to be with you
And I'm not the kind of person that do things like that
Not the crazy, adventurous loving that
But I flew over the world to be with you
'Cause it's you, it's you, it's you
It's you I want by my side
Isn't it clear, it's clear, it's clear
It's clear I want you right now
And now you tell me that you ain't really sure
That you ain't happy anymore
While I flew over the world to be with you
You slip away, you slip away
I'm walking the streets I'm already familiar with
Along the river you love where the water's clear
But you always loose your way around here
'Cause it's you...
Wanted to open you, wanted to open you, wanted to open youYou might also likeEmbed
