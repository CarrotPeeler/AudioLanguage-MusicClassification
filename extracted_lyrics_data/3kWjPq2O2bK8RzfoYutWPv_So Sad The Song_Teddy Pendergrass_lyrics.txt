And said that it's best to forget
And we'll leave all our memories behind us
It's better ended and yet
So sad the song of two empty lives
When that moment of truth suddenly arrives
So sad the song of what might've been
Seeing a lifetime of dreams scattered in the wind
Together, we belong together
Never was that one lovely word easiеr to say
So sad the song of just remembеring when
Knowing the love of your life
Will never come again
Together, we belong together
I'll love you forever
On that you can rely
So would it be wrong to give our love
Just one more try, my darlin'
So sad the song that says goodbye
So sad the song that says goodbyeYou might also likeEmbed
