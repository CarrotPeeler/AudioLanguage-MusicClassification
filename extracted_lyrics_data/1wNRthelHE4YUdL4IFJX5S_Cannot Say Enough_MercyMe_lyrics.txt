4 ContributorsCannot Say Enough LyricsWhat can we say to describe just a glimpse of Your glory
How can our words portray but a thread of Your majesty
But still we praise our Savior
In Spirit and in truth
For we cannot say enough about You, yeah
What can we say to describe just a glimpse of Your glory
How can our words portray but a thread of Your majesty
But still we praise our Savior
In Spirit and in truth
For we cannot say enough about You
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah
But still we praise our Savior in Spirit and in Truth
For we cannot say enough about You
Oh we cannot say... enough about You
Ohhh we cannot say...See MercyMe LiveGet tickets as low as $48You might also likeEmbed
