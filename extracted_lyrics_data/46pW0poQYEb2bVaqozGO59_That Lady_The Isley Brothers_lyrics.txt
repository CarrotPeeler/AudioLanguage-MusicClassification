Who's that lady? (Who's that lady?)
Beautiful lady (Who's that lady?)
Who's that lady? (Who's that lady?)
That real, real, real fine lady (A beautiful lady)
I wish somebody would introduce her to me

I didn't get a chance (I didn't get a chance)
To ask her to dance (To ask her to dance)
It was love at first sight (Love at first sight)
I just saw her tonight (Saw her tonight)
And I wish somebody would introduce her to me
I like the way she danced in the dark
And disappeared in the night
And, oh, she stole my heart
It was love at first sight

Who's that lady? (Who's that lady?)
That beautiful lady (The beautiful lady)
Who's that lady? (Who's that lady?)
I gotta meet that lady (Who's that lady?)
And I wish somebody would introduce her to me

Woah, who's that lady? (Who's that lady?)
That real fine lady (The beautiful lady)
Who's that lady? (I'm talkin' 'bout that lady)
That beautiful lady (The beautiful lady)
I wish somebody would introduce her to me, yeah, yeah, yeah
You might also like
(Who's that lady?)
(Who's that lady?)
(The beautiful lady)
(I'm talkin' 'bout that lady)

Said, hey, lady
I'm in love with you, yeah, yeahEmbed
