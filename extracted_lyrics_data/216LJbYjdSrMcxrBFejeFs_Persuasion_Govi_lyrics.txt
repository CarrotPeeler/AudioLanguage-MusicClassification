Lose control, control
Lose control x2
Control x2
Lose Control x2
Control x2
(Chorus)
No matter where you go, the love keeps going
No matter what you say, the world keeps turning
No matter what you do, the fire keeps burning
Don't get in your own way, just lose control
(Verse 1)
You got me loosing control
I love you for who you are ay
Breeze me away, just take me away to that place
Yeah, where you know, all the problems go
Nothing to worry, no no no
Yeah I know, the things that you went through
The things that they all said
Yeah they left you for dead
Don't go, don't go, baby don't go
Cause I'm here for you, I wanna dance with you
(Pre Chorus)
