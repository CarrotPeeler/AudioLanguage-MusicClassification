1 ContributorBroken Bonds Of Friendship LyricsYOU'RE TRYING TO RESHAPE ME
HOW CAN YOU THINK WHEN YOU KNOW
I WON'T BE BE STANDING FOR AN IMAGE
TAKE ME AS I AM OR LET ME GO
I TEAR MY FACE TO THE WALL
SO ASHAMED FROM THIS BAD SITUATION
NO WAY TO STOP IT WILL GROW
I'M RUNNING LIKE A THIEF FLEE IN DESPERATION
I DON'T CARE ABOUT GETTING YOUR RESPECT
I'VE GOT NOTHING TO BELIEVE IN NOTHING TO REGRET
BROKEN BONDS OF FRIENDSHIP
I GOT IT UPFRONT WASTING MYSELF ON YOUR SHIT
YOU THREW IT AWAY BREAK IT UP AND FLAUNT IT
BROKEN BONDS OF FRIENDSHIP
I TRY TO BREAK IT AWAY
THIS FRIENDSHIP CAUSES PAIN
IT'S YOUR FUCKIN' WAY OF LIFE I DISDAIN
I'VE BEEN CLOSE TO TRUST
AND YOU THREW IT ALL AWAY
YES I TRIED I TRIED TO HIDE THE FEELINGS I LET GO
YES YOU TRIED YOU TRIED TO FIGHT
NO WAY TO STOP IT WILL GROW
BROKEN BONDS OF FRIENDSHIP
I TRY TO BREAK IT AWAY
BROKEN BONDS OF FRIENDSHIP
I TRY TO BREAK IT AWAYYou might also likeEmbed
