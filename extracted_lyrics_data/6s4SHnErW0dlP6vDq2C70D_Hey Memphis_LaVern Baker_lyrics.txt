Hey Memphis, won't you kiss me once or twice?
Make me feel so nice, I'd never run
Hey Memphis, I won't do what my big sister done
Well, you dated my big sister
You took her to a show
You went for some candy, along came Jim Dandy
And they snuck right out of the door
Hey Memphis, won't you? Hey Memphis, won't you?
Hey Memphis, won't you kiss me once or twice?
Make me feel so nice, I'd never run
Hey Memphis, I won't do what my big sister done
Every time you saw my sister
She had somebody new
She's mean and she's evil like that little ol' boll weevil
But I won't do the same to you
Hey Memphis, won't you? Hey Memphis, won't you?
Hey Memphis, won't you kiss me once or twice?
Make me feel so nice, I'd never run
Hey Memphis, I won't do what my big sister done
Well, you used to pull my pigtails
And punch my turned-up nose
But I've been a-growing and baby, it's been showing
From my head down to my toes

Hey Memphis, won't you kiss me once or twice?
And make me feel so nice, I'd never run
Whoa, hey Memphis, I won't do what my big sister done
Hey Memphis, I won't do what my big sister done
Ah, hey Memphis, I won't do what my big sister doneEmbed
