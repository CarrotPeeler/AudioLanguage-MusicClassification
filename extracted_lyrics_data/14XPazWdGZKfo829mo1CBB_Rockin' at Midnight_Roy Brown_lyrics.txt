1 ContributorRockin’ At Midnight Lyrics
Well, have you heard the news
About the good rockin' at midnight
Well, I held my baby with all my might
What a wonderful time we had that night
Have you heard the news
About the good rockin’ at midnight
Well, have you heard the news
About the good rockin' at midnight
Well, I held my baby with all my might
What a wonderful time we had that night
Have you heard the news
About the good rockin' at midnight

Well, sweet Georgia Brown and sweet Lorraine
They got caught with Caledonia’s men
Sioux City Sue told it all
Those girls got together and had a ball
Crying hеy, hey, there's good rockin' at midnight, hеy

Well, I wanna tell you about deacon Jones
He got so high they had to take him home
Here's the news about elder Brown
He stole all the chicken and ran to town
Crying hey man, there's good rockin' at midnight
You might also like
Well, Caledonia got drunk, greed like a pig
She fell down and lost her wig
Fanny Brown she laughed 'til she got sick
Caledonia got mad and grabbed a brick
Crying hey man, there's good rockin’ at midnight

Hey, hey, we gonna rock
Hey, hey, hey, hey, we gonna rock
Hey, hey, hey, we gonna rock
Hey, we gonna rock
We gonna rock
We gonna rock this house tonight
We gonna rock
We gonna rock
We gonna rock, gonna rock, rock
Have you heard the news about good rockin’ at midnightEmbed
