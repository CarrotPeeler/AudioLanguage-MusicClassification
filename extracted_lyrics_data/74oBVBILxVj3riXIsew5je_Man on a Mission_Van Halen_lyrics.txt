7 ContributorsMan on a Mission LyricsI got a one-track mind, my blinders up
Now all I gotta do is get up, go out and get her
Got the first step down, I know what I want
All seven senses tryin' to deliver
Baby, let me fill you up inside (Up inside)
Spread your wings and open wide (Open wide)
So hot, so hot, so hot
I'm a man on a mission, yeah, straight ahead
Less talk, more action, with no distraction, yeah
I'm all conditioned, yeah, a thoroughbred
Go for the action, yeah, with no distractions, yeah
You get every inch, flesh, blood and bone
And it's all wrapped up in a tight little bundle
I’ve got an open mind, do anything
I’m aware the ball might roll or tumble
So right down to the bottom or the top (Ooh, ooh)
I'm gonna get it all in one big pot (One big pot)
Yeah, she got, she got me hot
Uh, I'm a man on a mission, straight ahead
Less talk, more action, yeah, with no distraction
I'm all conditioned, yeah, I'm a thoroughbred
Less talk, more action, with no distraction

So get on out of the way
Only thing that's on my mind
Ah, she's sure got my attention
What you take's the real kind
Oh

Uh
Ah, come on, she got, she got, ah
Man on a mission, straight ahead
No talk, pure action, I got no distractions
I'm all conditioned, what I say
A man on a mission, yeah, up ahead, oh yeah
Whew, my kinda action, oh
Ow, uh
No distractions
I got no distractions
No distraction
Uh, no distraction, I'm on a mission, whew, ow1Embed
