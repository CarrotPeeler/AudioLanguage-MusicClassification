1 ContributorThe Art of American Football LyricsShove! The momentum drags us under
Your constant disregard, your constant aggravation
Tell me nothing but home truths and I’ll show you starvation
On a black and white screen, this is your movie queen

Stop and think a second (Tune in! Tune out!)
It's something more than nothing (Drop in! Drop out!)
I see the way you lie to them (Tune in! Tune out!)
All for the country, you say (Fuck them! Fuck us!)
Progress is the alternative to which we align
Hopeless intuition raped between the lines
You tune in, you tune out
You climb a ladder, fucked before we get out
You tune in, you tune out
‘Cause we’re fucked before...

This system, this lie x4
