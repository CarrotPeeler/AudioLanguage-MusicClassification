1 ContributorNo More Time LyricsThis one is for all the people in the world today
Coming out to you live and direct
Dig that on the microphone and me nah go play
Me nah go play
Me nah go play
No, no, no, no, no, no...
Girl you know I'm in love with you
Tell me what you want me to do
I can’t waste no more time
This is my only Divine
Here I go around the pen again
Listen to you, a hopeless friend
I don't got no time to waste
This ain't love of you is a disgrace
Here I go around the bend
Reading I bring to you my friend
I don’t got no time to waste
This a music is all my disgrace
I've told all you bеfore
That I'm in love with you
You knew would nеver care
Now I see that you do
I don't got no more time to waste
Loving you is a big disgrace
Hold my head above the sky
Oh baby girl you make me cry
You make me cry

I love you in the morning
And in the evening though
I love you is the matter
What the hell you gonna do?
I love you in the morning
And in the evening too, baby girl
I'm in love with you
Whoah, whoah, whoah, whoah
Baby girl I'm in love with you
Please tell me what you're gonna do
How many roads do you have to cross
Before I could try to the boss
I want it from over us
Whoah, whoah, whoah, whoah
Girl, I'm in love with you
Whoah, Girl, I'm in love with youEmbed
