10 ContributorsLetter - from The Lost Days Lyrics
A letter to my future self, "am I still happy?" I began
"Have I grown more pretty, is Daddy still a good man?
Am I still friends with Colleen? I'm sure that I'm still laughing
Aren't I? Aren't I?
Hey there to my future self, if you forget how to smile
I have this to tell you: remember it once in a while
Ten years ago your past self prayed for your happiness
Please don't lose hope"

Oh, oh what a pair me and you
Put here to feel joy, not be blue
Sad times and bad times see them through
Soon we will know if it's for real what we both feel

"Though I can't know for sure how things worked out for us
No matter how hard it gets, you have to realize:
We weren't put on this earth to suffer and cry
We were made for being happy
So, be happy, for me, for you, please"

Oh, oh what a pair me and you
Put here to feel joy, not be blue
Sad times and bad times see them through
Soon we will know if it's for real what we both feel
You might also like
We were put here on this earth, put here to feel joy
We were put here on this earth, put here to feel joy
We were put here on this earth, put here to feel joy
We were put here on this earth, put here to feel joyEmbed
