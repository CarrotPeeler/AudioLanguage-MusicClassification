4 ContributorsOrange Colored Sky Lyrics
I was walkin' along, mindin' my business
When out of the orange-colored sky
Wham, bam, alakazam!
Wonderful you came by

I was hummin' a tune, drinkin' in sunshine
When out of that orange-colored sky
Wham, bam, alakazam!
I got a look at you

One look and I yelled "Help me, watch out for flyin' glass!"
'Cause the ceiling fell in and the bottom fell out
I went into a spin and I started to shout
"I've been hit... this is it... THIS IS IT!"

I was walkin' along, minding my business
When love came and hit me in the eye
Wham, bam, alakazam!
Outta the orange-colored sky

Look out below!

One look and I yelled "Help me, watch out for flyin' glass!"
'Cause the ceiling fell in and the bottom fell out
I went into a spin and I started to shout
"I've been hit... this is it... THIS IS IT!"

I was walkin' along, minding my business
When love came and hit me in the eye
Wham, bam, alakazam!
Outta the orange-colored sky

Flash, bam, alakazam!
Wonderful you came byEmbed
