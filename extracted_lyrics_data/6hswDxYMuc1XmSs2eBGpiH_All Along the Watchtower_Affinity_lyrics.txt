3 ContributorsAll Along the Watchtower Lyrics
"There must be some way out of here," said the seeker to the thief
"There's too much confusion and I can't get no relief
Businessmen drink my wine, and plowmen dig my earth
None of them along the line know any of its worth"

"No reason to get excited," he spoke
"You know there are many here who think that life is a joke
But you and I, we've been through that and this is not our fate
So let us not talk falsely, for the hour is getting late"

All along the watchtower, the prince, he kept the view
All his women came and went, all the foot servants too
Outside in the distance, a wildcat did growl
Two riders were approaching and the wind began to howl

All along the watchtower, the prince, he kept the view
All his women came and went, all the foot servants too
Outside in the distance, a wildcat did growl
Two riders were approaching and the wind began to howlYou might also likeEmbed
