Feel my heart has turned to grey
Feel my heart
Feel my heart, it’s turned to grey
I fall apart
Inside my heart you slipped away
I feel the same now
Feel my heart, it’s slipped away
And now
And then
Every time
You go away
(You go away)
Feel my heart
Feel my heart
Feel my heart, it’s turned to grey
I fall apart
(Fall apart)
Inside my heart you slipped away
I feel the same now
(I feel the same)
Feel my heart, it’s slipped awayYou might also likeEmbed
