2 ContributorsYou Are, You Are LyricsYou are, you are hopefully mistaken
Like old ties, you'll soon be broken down
Like all the rest who tried
You are, you are something quite surprising
Story's odd concerning love
The scene will change for you, you know
You are, you are just a good reflection
Nothing more, you'd like to take me
For the world to see you leave
You are, you're a living exhibition
Defying age like a seasoned veteran
Of men for cash
I know how to hide and wait for you
I know how to wait
I won't forget exactly what you are
See her shine like stars before they burn
See her shine with stars before they fade away
Such a shame
The best of fame
I know how to hide and wait for you
I know how to wait
I won't forget exactly what you are
You might also likeI know how to hide and wait for you
I know how to wait
I won't forget exactly what you are
I know how to hide and wait for you
I know how to hide
I won't forget exactly what you are
I know how to hide and wait for you
I know how to wait
I won't forget exactly what you are
'Cause I know how to hide and wait for you
I know how to wait
I won't forget exactly whatEmbed
