It's funny, you know
'Cause there's an old rock 'n' roller, he's got nowhere to go
Did you ever think of taking him in?
Somebody help him, somebody please

Put another record on
'Cause he likes that song

It's funny, you know
He never done nothing, done nobody wrong
Didn't think about changing his name
But I'm gonna tell him it's the same old game

Put another record on

Round, round, round and around, oh
Oh, see him smile

Well, lately I've seen him
Walkin' down the street, kinda movin' his feet
Everyone I know looks the other way
Somebody help him, somebody say
You might also like
"Put another record on"

Round, round, round and around, oh
Oh, see him smile

It's funny, you know
'Cause there's an old rock 'n' roller, he's got nowhere to go
Did you ever think of taking him in?
Somebody help him, somebody please

Just put another record on
Put another record on

Put another record on ('Cause you know we like it)
Put another record on ('Cause you know we like it)
Put another record on ('Cause you know we like it)
Put another record on ('Cause you know we like it)
Put another record on ('Cause you know we like it)
Put another record on ('Cause you know we like it)Embed
