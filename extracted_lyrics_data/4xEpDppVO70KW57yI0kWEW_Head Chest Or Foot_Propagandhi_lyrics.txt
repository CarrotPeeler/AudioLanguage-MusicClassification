8 ContributorsHead? Chest? Or Foot? Lyrics
Three choices, one bullet
One trigger, guess who gets to pull it?
One leader, a thousand slaves
For every throne, there's a thousand graves

You're all the same
Just part of their machine
Perpetuate their dream

They subsidize your nightclubs and they subsidize your malls
They herd and brand the masses within painted prison walls
Until your freedom of assembly becomes the missiles they create
Or just mass delusion, dancing to this music that you fucking hate

But I'm not the same
I'm not part of your fucking machine
I'll jeopardize your dream

I'd rather be imprisoned in a George Orwellian world
Than your pacified society of happy boys and girls
I'd rather know my enemies and let them know the same
Whose windows to smash and whose tires to slash and where to point the fucking blame
You might also like
One future, two choices
Oppose them or let them destroy usEmbed
