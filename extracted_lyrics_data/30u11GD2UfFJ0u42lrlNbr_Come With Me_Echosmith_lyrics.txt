Background noise
Are all the things that get in the way
I had no choice
You came to me
I took you around
But it didn't matter where we were going
You're the only sound
That I ever want to hear

Come with me
And I'll take you away if you'll let me
Stay with me
And I'll cover your soul with my body
Give me your heart
And I'll give you my love
It's a work of art
When you shine like the sun
So give your heart to me
Give your heart to me

Carefully
You came to me ever so gently
Tonight you look lovely
Let me wrap my arms around you
Let me take you home
I want you to myself
You're the only thing that I ever need to know

Come with me
And I'll take you away if you'll let me
Stay with me
And I'll cover your soul with my body
Give me your heart
And I'll give you my love
It's a work of art
When you shine like the sun
So give your heart to me

And all the stars tonight are shining in your eyes
Our love is looking so bright
Let's take a chance and see, a chance of what could be
In love and running so free
So free
So free, free
Hey

Come with me
And I'll take you away if you'll let me
Stay with me
And I'll cover your soul with my body
Give me your heart
And I'll give you my love
It's a work of art
When you shine like the sun
So give your heart to me1Embed
