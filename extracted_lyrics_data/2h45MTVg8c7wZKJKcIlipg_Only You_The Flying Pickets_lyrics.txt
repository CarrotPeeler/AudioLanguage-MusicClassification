Ba da da da, ba da da da
Ba da da da, ba da da da
Ba da da da, ba da da da

Looking from a window above
It's like a story of love
Can you hear me?
Came back only yesterday
I'm moving further away
Want you near me

All I needed was the love you gave
All I needed for another day
And all I ever knew
Only you

Sometimes when I think of your name
When it's only a game
And I need you
Listening to the words that you say
It's getting harder to stay
When I see you
You might also like
All I needed was the love you gave
All I needed for another day
And all I ever knew
Only you
Ba da, ba da, ba da da da
Ba da da da, ba da da da
Ba da, ba da, ba da, ba da, ba da da da da da da da
Ba da da da da da da da, ba da da da da da da da

All I needed was the love you gave
All I needed for another day
And all I ever knew
Only you

This is going to take a long time
And I wonder what's mine
Can't take no more (Can't take no more)
Wonder if you'll understand
It's just the touch of your hand
Behind a closed door

All I needed was the love you gave
All I needed for another day
And all I ever knew (All I ever knew)
Only you
Ba da da da, ba da da da
Ba da da da, ba da da da
Ba da da da, ba da da da
Ba da da da, ba da da da4Embed
