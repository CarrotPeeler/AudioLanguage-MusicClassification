1 ContributorBright Sunny South Lyrics
In the bright sunny south, in peace and content
The days of my boyhood, I scarcely have spent
From the deep flowing spring to the broad flowing stream
Ever dear to my memory, sweet is my dream

I'll leave my confinement and comfort of life
The danger of bloodshed, provision, and strife
I've come to conclose and reply with my word
As I shoulder my musket and billet my sword

My father looked sad as he begged me to part
And my mother embraced me with anguish of heart
And my bеautiful sister looked pale in hеr woe
As she grabbed me and blessed me and told me to go

Dear father, dear father, for me, do not weep
For on some high mountain, I mean for to sleep
And the danger of war, I intend for to share
And for sickness and death, I intend to prepare

Dear mother, dear mother, for me, do not weep
For a mother's kind voice I ever will keep
You have taught me be brave from a boy to a man
And I'm going in defense of her own native land
You might also like
Dear sister, dear sister, I cannot tell the woe
Your tears and your sorrow, they trouble me so
I must be a-going for here I cannot stand
For I'm going in defense of her own native landEmbed
