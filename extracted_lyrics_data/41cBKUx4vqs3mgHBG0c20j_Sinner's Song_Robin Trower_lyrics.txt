And I never was a winner
Down in desolation
Till I find my vocation
Found a real solution
That's gonna end my mind's confusion
Got my invitation to the final revelation
Well I used to be a sinner
And I never was a winner
Down in desolation
Till I find my real vocation
Hey don't mind my pillar
I'm just looking for my Savior
Goin' over Jordan
I'm layin' down my burden
Used to be a sinner
And I never was a winner
Down in desolation
Till I find my vocationSee Robin Trower LiveGet tickets as low as $68You might also likeEmbed
