1 ContributorChemdawg LyricsThe first time that I was on a seesaw
Obvious, I need to start the crockpot
Then I seen Saw, carving up her figure, taking a limb off
Fuck your leg up, yeah, grounded up in the upheaval process
The horse chariot charging, tied up troll attached to it
Opposite direction, off of the shoulder on the left
Arm out of the socket, I’m outta pocket, magic 8-ball, haha!
When I was a kid, off white, high was too low to some dudes who stay blasted
Then I went back to normal
A gruesome scene, healed it all back, ahh shit
Shot from the stars passed the Centaurus like a starship
She don’t even shine now, she down on earthworm level
Imma sip my mud while she suck me like a dirt devil
How the hell you get to rehab then started taking Benzos?
Had to tell the nurses “it's addictive, this ain't making sense ho"
Ex sobered up, still, I’m down her throat like a pill
I don’t do no coke but roll with 100 dollar bills
Tell you be less white it come from polar bears
Boycott red hot for pouring that shit on a plant
How you assume that plants not screaming
When they come out of the ground just cause you don’t hear that shit demons
Ya think they waiting there saying what will the witches harvest?
Schnooty cold-blooded so most women’s nipples harden
Your son still said he’s smoking who?
Din’t pull his pants up yet, casting spells, taking my life too?
Yeah, you got your son killed you dumb bitch
With your cunt lies, he need connection and you just a hedonist
Blunts seem to keep burning, it’s endless
This is BioShock Infinite Elizabeth
We in the Bermuda Triangle
Too dark to see, is that a beluga, I don’t know?
Now my ex call back; she know me and Malcolm got the same spirit animal
See me and Salma Hayek in a kayak, I was in the back
It’s hard to say and keep it appropriate how I really feel about that;
We gon’ name the kid Ashe
While you in your real life and flee to
Your mom’s house with your Pichu
Seen old geezas with the gold enamel
You modern fam mother fuckers still holding camel?
Conjure up crime scene medical phenomena, they never thought was possible
Medicinal Marijuana, memory’s a goner, starry head trauma
Ghost story’s comprehendible
Real life is questionable
It’s no congratulations for supercentenarian like frickin' Judas Iscariot
Facing fears out here, don’t act like the scariest
You might also likeProbably just got some weed in this mic
Hatred
Remington splashes that’ll stop you dead in your tracks when
I walk up like Awake the Rapper, could
Or drive by like math, do the math, you pack of faggots
Will be looking so disastrous you think a second 9/11 happened
Didn’t think I’d be forgetting all that
Or forgiving fore I’m getting you bagged
In lawn in refuse
Or I grab the Sig Sauers
While I’m hitting cigs of sour for hours
Hit a homeless man in my car last week, here-uhh
Five fingers on a fist for hitting my fucking mirror
Autographs, shit smearing like the library Kensington has
Then I’m at Lexington Ave
Matter fact, Imma spin the Mall, Lennox
Yeah, along with Stackzzz and Rhymenoceros
The Lion is my nickname, Lennox Claudius
While “lying" is your middle name your a fraud and bitch
The game is over with we hitting off on the console’s switch
Its not a few, not even two alive I’ve made the bond to
So if you turned your back, big whore you made the wrong move
Like lonely bones, let me lay this out for you
In Delaware but my dickhead’s still in Connecticut, you must’ve went to lazybone law school
You dissed the bowl, now you hop back in line, gotta kiss the ladle
Never give labels, rarely do, ok but today I will
Forgot the bowl in soup line you a ladle kisser
I slay ya when I diss ya, you a uncreative ass-of-label-kisser
Convert to cai-lyn, Able sister
Forget the t and cross, put it between your eyes, I made mistakes, I’m a errorist
We see the serpent head, the playing field level it
One shovel kick will sever it, ending the rest of it
Could never quit, I put my two weeks in, it’s just the weakest employees list
Cable watchers. Make art messed up still don’t need to know what eraser is
No coming back from the dead, this is not laser tag
We slay you and we just want you to know that you ain’t really Lazarus
I’m not waiting for the retaliation
Snort little
We start the war as soon as we seen it coming doggy
I’ll run across the street, what up bitch? Mama’s boy, He knows
Skinny for a swine-body, skip math and hit watts
A block buster, know every flick spot on this block
Sway I got “How’s”
Yet I’m homeless when I bounce out
Cause y’all ain’t really gonna help me the fuck out, so fuck out
This industry, I’m in my old workplace, I’ll never be played
Like remember the name, Ember McClain
Memory fades
I’ll catch a felony case
Check out my melody
Here’s a gem for you, the vulture is opposite the goat
Yeah, Yung Schnooty
Ill pull a mass shooting with a twenty two in a tutu, dunn I do what I want to
Yung Schnoot, you could never stop
Even at a red light
I just go right through
Soon as the beat’s produced I just spit, I hocked a loogey
He passed it to me
Feel gracious that’s an oppurtunity
So I hop on it quicker than hopscotch, double dutch
You like Rocky, you's a runner up
Rock Steady, they say you done too much
We was just begunning bruh, we was just warming up
You know what I’m tryna say, get it across
Any point I got you know it is not a prob
For you to get it like you gettin shanked while getting robbed
And hopefully no one takes you to the hospital, you won’t make it cause twenty minutes away’s way too long
I’ll see you there maybe cause where you think I’m on my way to
Emergency room, the janitor suit, spray you
There’s no grave level or too far we can’t take to
One take it, like a plane hijacking
What do you mean? I owe all 4
My Axis
Or should I say my axis?
Schnooty was yung and in a pinch stepping on the rap scene
Like I said the God is great so be grateful
Of course, through a hater’s ears my art seems hateful
That’s distasteful, inappropriate and honestly it’s awfully disgraceful
To say that in actuality any of my raps call for violence
See me pull strings like bowing or when you strummed violins
Keep my hands clean in the grand scheme
I’m smoking on grape jelly
It’s no obstacles, memories run quite well
Nostalgia pulls, as we puff on this leaf
I'm wondering what the fuck can they say to me
Oh it’s more BS, who believes? Probably nobody, yeah
But there’s a bozo for every wise-man
There’s folks that don’t know how to approach Schnooty rhyming
I smoked you on stage so to treat you like the highest in the room
Is not even a possibility, I exposed you as a hymen
Even though all we did was ‘spoke’ it’s like cause my flow knows no limits
Though I just get it like a deer in headlights, I just hit it
Yeah, when new employees get hired, people get fired
Yung Schnooty, Seems like I never get tired
Started rhyming to reinvent the wheel
I kept writing to prevent a kill
Yeah
