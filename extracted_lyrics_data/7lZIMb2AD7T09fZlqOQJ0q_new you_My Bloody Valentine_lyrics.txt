Too close when it's really with me
Something comes and pins me to the sky to come
Too slow when the moon is with you
I'll be too and wish you up with me to come soon

Maybe we can say, holding me for the way
Come back, it's not tomorrow 'cause
Always today's fun we know
Just like I knew you wanted me to do
What can I see?
How can I feel too?
All kinds of new you
