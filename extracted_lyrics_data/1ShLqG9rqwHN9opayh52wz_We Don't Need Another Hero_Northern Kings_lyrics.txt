1 ContributorWe Donâ€™t Need Another Hero Lyrics
Out of the ruins
Out from the wreckage
Can't make the same mistake this time
We are the children
The last generation
We are the ones they left behind

And I wonder when we are ever gonna change it
Living under the fear 'till nothing else remains

We don't need another hero
We don't need to know the way home
All we want is life beyond
The Thunderdome

Looking for something we can rely on
There's got to be something better out there:
Love and compassion (Love and compassion)
Their day is coming (Their day is coming)
All else are castles built in the air (air)

And I wonder when we are ever gonna change it
Living under the fear 'till nothing else remains
You might also like
All the children say
We don't need another hero
We don't need to know the way home
All we want is life beyond
The Thunderdome

So, what do we do with our lives
We leave only a mark
Will our story shine like a light
Or end in the dark
Give it all or nothing

We don't need another hero
We don't need to know the way home
All we want is life beyond
The Thunderdome
We don't need another hero
We don't need to know the way home
All we want is life beyond
The Thunderdome

We are the children
And I wonder when we are ever gonna change it
(Nothing else remains) The last generation
(We don't need another hero) Out of the ruins
Out from the wreckage (Out from the wreckage)Embed
