1 ContributorHymn 4 My Soul LyricsI saw myself today
I smiled and I looked away
Saddened by my visible life
Sorrow cut me like a knife
Nobody knows you
Without any doubt
Nobody wants to know you
When you're down and out
So sing a hymn for my soul
Stand by me as I grow
I'm just trying to climb up nine hills
In seven short days
Sing a hymn for my soul
I saw myself today
Didn't like what I had to say
So right I could only be wrong
Trouble is when I'm alone
No doubt, no self-control
Not a reason to cry
I fall like empty rain
Through an empty sky
So sing a hymn for my soul
Stand by me as I grow
I'm just trying to climb up nine hills
In seven short days
Sing a hymn for my soul
You might also likeI saw myself today
I looked good, yeah, I have to say
Polished TV won't shine no more
Flyin' dragons surround my door
Even when I go crazy
To my own self I'll be true
Ain't nobody's business what I do
So sing a hymn for my soul
Stand by me as I grow
I'm just trying to climb up nine hills
In seven short days
Sing a hymn for my soul
Sing a hymn for my soul
Stand by me as I grow
I'm just trying to climb up nine hills
In seven short days
Sing a hymn for my soulEmbed
