Are we alive?
Because I heard a rumor
That the day we died was yesterday
So are we rotting now?
Can't find our graves?

Well, they created a lie
Built out of structure
And routine by robots
But this night
We're taking the virus to them

Burn this city to let them know we're here
Burn this city to reinstall the fear
How can I sleep when you pull focus
Right before my eyes?
Still, they find another way
To put a different gun to our heads
And so I take a breath
There's plenty time to sleep when I'm dead
Is this the only way it's ever gonna be?
Right before, right before my eyes
You might also like
...Don't wanna think about the end
When this ride is just getting started
Roads uncharted
Or is this end of the line? (Line!)
I'm not giving lessons
Lessons how stars are forged
I just keep my finger on the trigger
And blow 'em away, yeah, one by one

So can we all scream? (Yeah!)
Loud enough to awaken
The zombies of society
Who control these times?

Burn this city to let them know we're here
Burn this city to reinstall the fear
How can I sleep when you pull focus
Right before my eyes?
Still, they find another way
To put a different gun to our heads
And so I take a breath
There's plenty time to sleep when I'm dead
Is this the only way it's ever gonna be?
Right before, right before my eyes
And I still want to see the light (see the light)
Shining in front of my eyes

Running's easy
Where will we go? Who knows?
Don't look back
As long as I've got you, we'll make it

Burn this city to let them know we're here
Burn this city to reinstall the fear
How can I sleep when you pull focus
Right before my eyes?
Still, they find another way
To put a different gun to our heads
And so I take a breath
There's plenty time to sleep when I'm dead
Is this the only way it's ever gonna be?
Right before, right before my

Burn this city to let them know we're here
Burn this city to reinstall the fear
Now I see the turning point is
Right before my...
Right before my eyesEmbed
