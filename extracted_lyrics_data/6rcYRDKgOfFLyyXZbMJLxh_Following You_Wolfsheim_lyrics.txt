1 ContributorFollowing You LyricsYou're walking through the night
Still can't near in light
And I'm following behind
You're playing games of sin
None that fools can win
And I'm following behind
(3x) Following you...
Do lovers understand your ply?
You command and they'll obey
And I'm watching from behind
One step forward, two steps back
I'm still following your track
And I'm watching from behind
(3x) Following you...
Waiting here beside you
Waiting for your call
Watching liars passing by
Uh, I hate them all
Don't you realize
That I'm the only one
Who's good for you?
You might also likeYou're so heartlessly sincere
But I'm still following you endlessly
I'm following behind
You ain't whore, you ain't nun
On the hunt and on the run
And I'm watching from behind
Always cheating, telling lies
Behind your door I heard you sigh:
"Oh prudence, come and rescue me!"
(12x)
"Prudence come and rescue me!"
Following you...Embed
