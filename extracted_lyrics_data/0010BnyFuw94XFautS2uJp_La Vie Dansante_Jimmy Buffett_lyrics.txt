3 ContributorsLa Vie Dansante Lyrics
They can come take it all away
Break your heart by the light of day
Drown your love in a distant bay so lonely
See the ships heading for the rocks
See the time melting off of the clocks
There's a light shatters all the locks and saves me, it saves me

That's why I wander and follow la vie dansante
On the night wind that takes me just where I want
That's all I want, la vie dansante
Why don't you wander and follow la vie dansante?
On the night wind that takes you just where you want
That's all you want, la vie dansante

Miss the beat if you close your eyes
Every night wears a new disguise
And I live when a new surprise surrenders
Feel it all with a willing heart
Every stop is a place to start
If you know how to play the part with feeling, I play with feelings

That's why I wander and follow la vie dansante
On the night wind that takes me just where I want
That's all I want, la vie dansante
Why don't you wander and follow la vie dansante?
On the night wind that takes you just where you want
That's all you want, la vie dansante
You might also like
That's why we wander and follow la vie dansante
On the night wind that takes us just where we want
That's all we want, la vie dansante
Why don't you wander and follow the dancing life?
On the night wind that takes you just where you want
That's all you want, la vie dansante

That's why we wander and follow la vie dansante
On the night wind that takes us just where we want
That's all we want, la vie dansante
La la la la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la la la
That's all we wantEmbed
