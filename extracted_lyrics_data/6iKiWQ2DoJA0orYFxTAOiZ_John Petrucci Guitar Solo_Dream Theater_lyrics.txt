1 ContributorJohn Petrucci Guitar Solo Lyrics

"There's no doubt about it that this guy, he can take it through the, uh, the entire emotional spectrum. It's interesting because I look out every evening and I see, uh, even men having tears coming down, their faces, not that the ladies are excluded, 'cause these ladies are more touched with their emotions, and they don't have a problem expressing it. But, uh, this guy here, he's done it, uh, well, ever since I've met him, he's, he's been playing guitar here, and just connecting with the instrument, and moving everyone. And, uh, there's no doubt that he is one of today's guitar greats, John Petrucci."See Dream Theater LiveGet tickets as low as $45You might also likeEmbed
