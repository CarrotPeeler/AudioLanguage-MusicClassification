15 ContributorsMuch Too Much Lyrics
Throwing your phone and throwing that pain at the wall
Making excuses, making it up
And breaking it off for once and for all
Taking a fall, then I'm feeling fine
Safe overall
Got people to call
Going outside, looking around
It ain't as safe as you pictured
Feeling the same old fears that never had a chance to begin with, no
And the road was tough, getting off was worse
And you can’t seem to get back to work
Watching people turning up to your own funeral
But what’s it gonna take, to pass the point and get in?
Don't let them get to dictating your life

Stranger
I know (I know, I know)
When I can look at the sky I've painted
Is it alright that I've lеft spaces?
Evening light, therе we go
Seurat, Monet
Picasso made the only one
That showed me how to do it in one run
Running out, running out
Running out, ooh

Much too much
I can't keep up, it's too tough
And I might move away, I'm making my mind up
I'll lead with love
I'll be keeping in touch with people I trust
Take a little time away when it feels too much
I said, much too much
I can't keep up, it's too tough
And I'm gonna move away, I'm still making my mind up, yeah

Hang out for a minute
Now you put your favorite work on the wall
Went with what you like
No more time to hide

Are you warm enough?
Stayed inside with the fire on
Your color's warm
Your color was often the same
But I was sometimes wrong
Though barely, but it went on for so long
People with different eyes
Spoke on deeper and deeper subjects
When we stayed inside with the fire on
This house is yours
This time you're mine and that's for sure
And when it's much too much
You lift me up and show me such love
Oh, ohEmbed
