1 ContributorUnder the light Lyrics"Under The Light"
Do you know how many times I
Broke down and burned the polaroids of you?
I penned my sins in blood for you
And wrote these words to heal my wounds
Do you know how many times I've
Been wondering who's making love to you?
But the scars on your forehead
Tell the stories 'bout what you've been through
You're stuck under the light
Lost on hazardous ground
Will you find your way out
And slip under my radar somehow?
Do you know how many times I
Lost my faith and trust because of you?
I wrote this song to let you know
That I was glad to see you go
You're stuck under the light
Lost on hazardous ground
Will you find your way out
And slip under my radar somehow?You might also likeEmbed
