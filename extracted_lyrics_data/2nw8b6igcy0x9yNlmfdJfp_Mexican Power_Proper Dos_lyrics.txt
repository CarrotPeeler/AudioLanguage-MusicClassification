3 ContributorsMexican Power Lyrics
Mexican Power!
That's the name of this cut, man
You got somethin' with that?
Hit the stop; eject button
Cause I ain't shutting up for no one, not a single soul
Remember me, the loco cholo going solo
Well I'm back with a new rap, they showed us and thought that
All we can do is dance around a motherfucking hat
But you are dead wrong, those days are long gone
'Cause my people are coming up and we're coming up strong
And if you don't believe me fool, well that's on you
But don't come crying saying I didn't warn you
Cause it's dead on your face, the power of my race
Expressed through the microphone as Ernie G drops bass
Critics in the place might disgrace and say my song is rough
But I say we've been kept down long enough
So if I seem bitter, consider the situation son
Maybe the blind could visualize where I'm coming from
Cause I'm not getting dumb or getting educated lessons
Of the underrated (power!) that my people are possessing
And plus Chicanos stood proud since Ave. street
Although it wasn't brought up in your class of history
So listen to me cause now it's my hour
And the lesson I'm kicking is called Mexican Power
You might also like
And I'm very proud of that
Mexican Power!
And I'm very proud of that

So due to your blue eyed teacher, I got to tell you
And shed some light on my race where he failed to
So I'm gonna kick it to you and you must learn
But it's a Mexican thing and it's Frank V.'s turn
To pick up the mic and try to unite my people
Hermanos y Hermanas damn straight we're equal
What, you don't think so, well think what you want to think
But sleep with your eyes open, watch your back, and don't blink
Cause I'll sneak attack you and jack you
Everything you said about us, I'm saying back to you
And more of it when the push comes to shoving
Wouldn't be a pretty sight...
But I'm not starting a fight, you know I'd rather unite
With the ones around us who respect the brown
Well fuck all the other motherfuckers who try to down us
Or who think they can clown us
But I'll just frown and instead I won't cry singing Tears of a Clown
Cause I ain't staying down for another day
Cause me and my people ain't going out that way
I'm gonna stand up tall and proud and never coward
But I'm not superman, it's called Mexican Power
And I'm very proud of that
It's called Mexican Power
And I'm very proud of that
Mexican Power watching the facility
Yeah
Mexican Power watching the facility
Yeah

So if you're a  crumb bum or a rich man
Beware of the power and don't you ever try to raise a hand
Or a fist to diss this Hispanic
Cuz just like a bandit, I'll leave you empty handed
And all you get return for that antic
Is proof that Mexican Power is la gang
So here is this hispanic, fear the brown planet
And if you can't stand it
Don't ever take my rhyme for granted
Cause I'll reprogram it and go spanish
The rest of the public, they won't understand this
Then they'll try to blame this single
So I just stick to bilingual cause I am the bilingual
That's doing this to mi carnalas and carnales
Watching my back is DJ Ernie Gonzalez
So if you want to be on this, I'll say ponle
Que Viva la Raza, I'll shake your hand and say oral√©
Cause if you're down for your race, then your down with me
And that right there holmes is how it should be
I know it could be better but it could be worse
Pride is the first step, first things first
Cause once we possess our calles on where we stand
We'll talk about unity among other Mexicans
But that's down the line, I know it's gonna take time
And if it ain't now, well next rythme
And there'll be another rhyme with no doubt
Cause I'm here to uplift, not to show out or go out
But blow out the brains of the lames and check the minds
Of those insinuating being brown is a crime
And if that's true, I guess I'm a criminal
Cause I'm brown to the maximum, never the minimal
So remember whenever I pick up a pen
Don't underestimate the power of a Mexican
Mexican Power!
And I'm very proud of that
Mexican Power
And I'm very proud of that
That's right, Mexican Power
And I'm very proud of that
It's called Mexican Power
I'm very proud of that
And I'm very proud of that
Mexican Power
I'm very proud of that
Mexican Power
I'm very proud of that
It's called Mexican Power
I'm very proud of that
Mexican Power
And I'm very proud of that
Very proud of that
It's called Mexican power
And I'm very proud of that
Mexican Power
And I'm very proud of that
Mexican Power
And I'm very proud of that
Mexican Power
And I'm very proud of thatEmbed
