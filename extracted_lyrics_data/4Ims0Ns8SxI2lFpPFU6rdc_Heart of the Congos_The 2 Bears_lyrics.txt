1 Contributorsong about africa Lyrics(Intro)
Yo, yo, listen up, let me take you on a ride
From the deserts to the oceans, where the lions reside
Africa's the heartbeat, the pulse, and the pride
Land of the legends, where the culture won’t hide
(Verse 1)
From the pyramids in Egypt to the Sahara's sand
Down to Cape Town beaches where the mountains stand
Got the Serеngeti sunrise, Maasai on the land
Drumming bеats in Ghana, you can hear the band
Nigeria's hustle, Lagos never sleeps
Congo’s rhythms, where the music runs deep
South Africa's streets, where the youth rise and shine
Ethiopia's coffee, best brew you'll find
(Chorus)
Africa, Africa, rise and shine
Land of the kings, where the sun aligns
From the East to the West, North to South side
Feel the spirit in the wind, see the strength worldwide
(Verse 2)
Malawi's warm heart, Rwanda's green hills
Zimbabwe's Victoria Falls, giving you chills
Morocco's markets with the spices and thrills
Cameroon’s vibes, football skills that kill
Senegal’s beats, dance to the djembe
The warmth of the people, hakuna matata days
From the Nile's flow to the Congo’s sway
Africa's beauty, no words can convey
You might also like(Bridge)
Yo, the spirit of Mandela, legacy won't fold
Queen Nefertiti, ancient stories told
Sankofa wisdom, looking back to be bold
In the heart of the motherland, the future's gold
(Chorus)
Africa, Africa, rise and shine
Land of the kings, where the sun aligns
From the East to the West, North to South side
Feel the spirit in the wind, see the strength worldwide
(Verse 3)
Drums in the night, stars up in the sky
Zulu warriors dance, eagles flying high
Jollof rice cooking, taste buds won’t lie
Malian blues strumming, desert lullabies
From the baobabs tall to the savannah plains
Rains down in Congo, then it's drought in the Sahel's chains
The struggle, the joy, it's all in our veins
Unity in the blood, breaking all chains
(Outro)
Yo, Africa, Africa, the story's untold
The heart of the world, the soul pure gold
From the sunrise shores to the mountains bold
The journey continues, the spirit never grows old
Peace, love, Africa, let the story unfoldEmbed
