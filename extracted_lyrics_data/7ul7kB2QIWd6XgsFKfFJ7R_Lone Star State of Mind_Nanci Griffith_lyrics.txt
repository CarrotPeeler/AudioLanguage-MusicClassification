5 ContributorsLone Star State Of Mind LyricsYour phone call took my by surprise
Gee, it's been a long, long time
Since those hot and humid Texas nights
When we went swimm'n in the tide
Corpus Christi seems so far away
And I'm not talkin' 'bout the miles
And there ain't much I wouldn't give today
Just to see one of your smiles
But here I sit alone in Denver
Sippin' California wine
And I've got all night to remember you
I'm in a lone star state of mind
I just saw John Wayne on the Late, Late Show
Save the girl and ride away
And I was hoping as the credits rolled
He'd make it back to her someday
But here I sit alone in Denver
Sippin' the California wine
And I've got all night to remember you
I'm in a lone star state of mind
It's a thousand miles or more
From here to your front door
I'd be there tomorrow if I left today
And I'd just pack up my guitar
You know it's really not that far
When you called you said I'd have a place to stay
You might also likeBut here I sit alone in Denver
Sippin' the California wine
And I've got all night to remember you
I'm in a lone star state of mindEmbed
