1 ContributorOh Susanna LyricsI come from Alabama with my banjo on my knee
I'm goin' to Louisiana my own true love for to see
It rained all night the day I left The weather was bone dry
And the sun so hot I froze to death Susanna don't you cry
Chorus:
Oh Susanna don't you cry for me
I come from Alabama with my banjo on my knee
Well I had a dream the other night when everything was still
I dreamed I saw Susanna comin' down the hill
A buckwheat cake was in her mouth a tear was in her eye
Said I'm comin' from the south Susanna don't you cry
(Chorus)
Well I soon will be in New Orleans and when I do arrive
I'll go and find Susanna if she is still alive
And if I do not find that girl I will surely die
But when I'm buried in my grave Susanna don't you cry
