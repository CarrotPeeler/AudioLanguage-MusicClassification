4 ContributorsCry for Me LyricsHave you ever felt like the sea of life, is taking you in?
Have you ever said to yourself sometimes, I wanna give in?
Have you ever felt like you're reaching out, but no one is there?
Coz I remember when I needed you, and you turn away, yeah
An you wanna know me now
Now your world is falling down
In your eyes it's plain to see
That you just wanna cry
Cry for me
Have you ever felt like you're running fast, but getting nowhere?
Have you ever felt like screaming out, but nobody hears?
Coz I remember when I needed you, and you turn away, yeah
An you wanna know me now
Now your world is falling down
In your eyes it's plain to see
That you just wanna cry
Cry for me
Cry for me
Cry for me
I remember when I needed you, and you turn away, yeah
Turn away
Turn away
An you wanna know me now
Now your whole world is falling down
Yes it is
In your eyes it's plain to see
That you just wanna cry
I know you just wanna cry
