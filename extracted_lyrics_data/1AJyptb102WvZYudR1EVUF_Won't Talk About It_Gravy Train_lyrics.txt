3 ContributorsWonâ€™t Talk About It LyricsSeems that the things I say
Have all been heard before
And if I have my way
I would not say no more
(Lovin' you) I won't talk about it
(Lovin' you) Won't talk about it
(Lovin' you) No, not a word
(Lovin' you) Hey, don't say a word!
Words gonna make you see
My mind is now proved wrong
All that I want to be
Is feel I am my own
(Lovin' you) I won't talk about it
(Lovin' you) Won't talk about it
(Lovin' you) No, not a word
(Lovin' you) Hey, don't say a word!
(Lovin' you) I won't talk about it
(Lovin' you) Won't talk about it
(Lovin' you) No, not a word
(Lovin' you) Hey, don't say a word!
You might also likeWarm when I feel you near
With that smile upon your face
Seeing that my way is clear
Till love is no disgrace
(Lovin' you) I won't talk about it
(Lovin' you) Won't talk about it
(Lovin' you) No, not a word
(Lovin' you) Hey, don't say a word!
(Lovin' you) I won't talk about it
(Lovin' you) Won't talk about it
(Lovin' you) No, not a word
(Lovin' you) Hey, don't say a word!Embed
