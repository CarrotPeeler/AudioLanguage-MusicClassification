Halfway through the night
I wake up in a dream
Echoes in my head
Make every whisper turn into a scream

I dreamed I could fly out in the blue
Over this town followin' you
Over the trees, subways and cars
I'd try to find out who you really are

In the middle of the night (middle of the night)
Cool sweatin' in my bed
Got the windows open wide
Thinkin' about all the things you said

I wish I could fly out in the blue
Over this town followin' you
I'd fly over rooftops, the great boulevards to try to find out
Who you really are

Who you really are
I wish I could fly now
I wish I could fly now
I wish I could fly now

I wish I could fly around and around
Over this town, the dirt on the ground
I'd follow your course of doors left ajar to try to find out
Who you really are
Who you really are

Fly, fly, fly
I wish I could fly
I wake up in a dream in the middle of the night
I wish I could fly
I wish I could fly1Embed
