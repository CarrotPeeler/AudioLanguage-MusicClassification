20 ContributorsCooke Lyrics
I'm circling the drain
With all my problems in hand
Well, I've got a pretty good hand, I'd say
But these new caskets crack the same
The first few stones are the worst
They fall in unnoticed
And scare you for more than they're worth
And all at once, you will not hear your own words

Closet weather at best, and you're a victim
You say we're all in the basket
But, oh, it's so fun to remind us
Over and over again
(We dug our own graves)
Time's a-wasting, so now I must be leaving
(We sealed our own fate)
I'm crawling outside, the same way that I creeped in
(We dug our own graves)
And the rain falls down, and it's heavy on my eyelids
(We sealed our own fate)
Pulled to the ground, down the fucking drain!

Maybe it's just my luck
But I got a spotless record
Maybe it's harder to stay
And we got it all wrong from the start
Maybe it's all in the cards
Or just an excuse for playing
Maybe it's all in our hearts
Maybe I don't know what I'm saying
You might also like
I'm circling the drain
But I'm picking these bones up
'Cause, man, they don't live there today
And I don't want to hear the fibers crack
'Cause God knows, I'd rather die than be dying!
It's not a cliché—no, sir
It is a logical preference, 'cause the way things were this year
Makes me think how good it all could be
And how well it could end!

Maybe it's just my luck
But I got a spotless record
Maybe it's harder to stay
And we got it all wrong from the start
Maybe it's all in the cards
Or just an excuse for playing
Maybe it's all in our hearts
Maybe I don’t know what I'm saying
But I'm saying it anyway...2Embed
