2 ContributorsSealine LyricsThe minute the sting penetrates your finger
You're strapped to the pain like an angry stranger
The moment the rain freezes in the gutter
Caught the flaming birds and their hideous matter
The second the claw lifts up your chin
I'm alone in your head and you can't get in
Somebody said that it's all for you
It's a miracle, let it alter you
But I will not follow you to the sealine
Somebody went and turned it on for you
Revelation baby, you're beautiful
But I will not follow you to the sealine
The instant the transfer hits your account
And it's deep in the black, and just one way out
The morning the storm rolled to the coast
We were down to the shake, and our silent throats
The evening the trees lash at the window
The roots crawl up, strangle the candles
Somebody said that it's all for you
It's a miracle, let it alter you
But I will not follow you to the sealine
You might also likeSomebody went and turned it on for you
Revelation baby, you're beautiful
But I will not follow you to the sealine
(To the sealine)
It's a miracle, let it alter you
Revelation baby, you're beautiful
To the sealineEmbed
