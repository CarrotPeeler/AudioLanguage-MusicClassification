Words left hanging in the air, in the air
Break the cycle
Round and round, round and round we go
You play hide and seek
Now I see, now I see the light
Eyes spilled over
Start to swim, start to swim away

These strange faces
It was only yesterday we spoke on the phone
A distant memory from all those years ago
But now I'm looking at these strange faces
And I'm not coming home

I've never heard you speak like this on the phone, on the phone
You carry the weight and I take the guilt
Brings me down, brings me down to this

These strange faces
It was only yesterday we spoke on the phone
A distant memory from all those years ago
But now I'm looking at these strange faces
And I'm not coming home
(And I'm not coming home)
(And I'm not coming home)You might also like3Embed
