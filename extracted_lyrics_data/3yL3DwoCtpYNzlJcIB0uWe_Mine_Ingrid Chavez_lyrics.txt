1 ContributorMine LyricsHair spread out
A net of stars
You begin
Where i do end
How divine
To call you mine
Eyes of heaven
And lips of wine
How divine to call you mine
Mine
To call you mine
I love you
And
I need you
You are whispered poetry
Carved into the pepper tree
How divine to call you mine
Eyes of heaven
And lips of wine
How divine to call you mine
Mine
To call you mine
I love you
And
I need you
We are one
We are one
When the day is done
Baby we'll still be one
We are one
We are one
The walls may tumble
But we will still be one
We are one baby
We are one
Cause your mine, mine, mine
We are one
So divine
We are one
To call you mine
We are one
Cause your mine mine
To call you mine
