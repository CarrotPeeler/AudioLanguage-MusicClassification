Ooh-ooh-hoo-ooh, hoo-ooh-hoo-ooh
Ooh-ooh-hoo-ooh, hoo-ooh-hoo-ooh
Ooh-ooh-hoo-ooh, hoo-ooh-hoo-ooh

(Headin' for the islands)
We're ready, man, and packed to go
Ooh-ooh-hoo-ooh, hoo-ooh-hoo-ooh
(When we hit those islands)
There's gonna be a big hello
Ooh-ooh-hoo-ooh, hoo-ooh-hoo-ooh
Diggin' all the sunshine
It's easy not to say goodbye, bye, bye, bye
(Headin' for the islands)
Hey, yeah, we're really flyin' high
Ooh-ooh-hoo-ooh, hoo-ooh-hoo-ooh
Ooh-ooh-hoo-ooh, hoo-ooh-hoo-ooh

Gotta go home, home, home
Gotta go home, home, home
Gotta go home, home, home
Gotta go home, home, home
Gotta go home
