Things are not always the way they should be
Words come easy if you-ou try
Hidin' in the shadow of your eyes
And I tell myself it's just a blue day
And it's hard to see it any other way
And I tell myself it's just a blue-ue day
Siftin' through the thoughts that lead you on
Find the door that's open, now you're gone
We softly say to our-ourselves
If we could be anybody else
And I tell myself it's just a blue day
And it's hard to see it any other way
Blue day-ay...
Blue day-ay...
When you fin'ly see the change in me
It's hard to understa-and
Why can't you see I'm just the same
As any other man
I can't seem to shake it off
It follows me around
Blue day-ay...
Blue day-ay-ay-ay...ay-ay-ay

And it's hard to see it any other way
I tell myself it's just a blue day
And it's hard to see it any other way
And I tell myself it's just a blue day
So hard to see it any other way
Blue-day-ay-ay-ay
(I tell myself it's just a blue day) (fade)Embed
