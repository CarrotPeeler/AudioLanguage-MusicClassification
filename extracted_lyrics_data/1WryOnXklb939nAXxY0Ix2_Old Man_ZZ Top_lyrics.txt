6 ContributorsOld Man Lyrics
Old man sleeping the hot day away
While he dreams about some yesterday
Because he's had so many come his way
All he cares about is somewhere
To lay his head tomorrow

Old man sits and thinks about his home
Doesn't matter cause he's all alone
What he'd give to get back on his own
Cursed his body because it's old
And it gives no transportation
He sits in his one room shack
Alone, but it provides no consolation

What a shame, his time is nearing
His eyes won't let him
See the skies are clearing
Someone tells him without his hearing
It's no news to those who've been around
While things are changing, no, no
