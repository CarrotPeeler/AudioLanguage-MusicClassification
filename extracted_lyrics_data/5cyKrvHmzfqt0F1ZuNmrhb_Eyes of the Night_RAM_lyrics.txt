1 ContributorEyes of the Night LyricsRoaming the starways
Swift astral flight
In from beyond and back
Seeking the conjurer
Seeking the one that calls for us tonight
We owe him allegiance
We are the eyes of the night
Once we were human
Now finally we have left the light
Lead us on
Controlling your nightmares
Ride on your back
Dancing around your corpse
Honour the master
The shadowman
Darkness incarnate
We owe him allegiance
We are the eyes of the night
Once we were human
Now finally we have left the light
Take heed all you humans
Don't close your eyes
We will be there tonight
Tormenting the dreamer
Stealing his soul
Offering to our lord

We are the eyes of the night
Once we were human
Now finally we have left the light
Lead us onEmbed
