2 ContributorsThe Sound of Names Dropping LyricsTonight I looked at you and you smiled
Will this feeling last forever?
Will it die and fade away?
Is this all that we'll share?
I'll pour my heart out if you'll stay
And there's a chance that you might say
"this could be never-ending."
Through all these years
The sweat and tears
And now it comes to this
I can't see that
The rituals of my life define me
No words can express
How you're loosing faith in me
And I'm loosing strength from you

I tried, you cried
We said we'd try so hard
It only goes so far
Will we make a dent
Or will we only leave a scar?
I can't believe that you turn your back
On everything you promised me
I can't believe that I turned my back
And now you've erased me
I can't believe that I turned my back
I always knew that you'd turn your back
And so it goes, well I suppose
Its time, its time to move along now
Times have changed and
Faces rearranged
Now you sing another song
You might also like
I tried, you cried
We said we'd try so hard
It only goes so far
Will we make a dent
Or will we only leave a scar
That night I looked at you and you smiled
The feeling's gone forever
It's been replaced with something new
There's nothing more for us to do
I gave you everything that I had
And after all that we've been through
This could be never-ending
I tried, you cried
We said we'd try so hard
It only goes so far
Will we make a dent
Or will we only leave a scarEmbed
