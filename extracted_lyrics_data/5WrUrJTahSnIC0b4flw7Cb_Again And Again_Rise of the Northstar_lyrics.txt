5 ContributorsAgain and Again LyricsYo yo yo
No motherfucking topic for this one, just a freestyle
Ssup' Shibuya, it's the Saiya's return
Stand up, rise up, let your cosmos burn
Pah Pah Pah, demonstrate some Saiya Style
Stay Gold like a Saint, represent this vibe
Focused on the curveball like an animal
Welcome to the jungle, town to town
R.O.T. to the motherfucking N
One day, one show, take a look around
To all the lovers, the haters
Ardent supporters
Since the beginning we play it fair
Follow the trend, we don't care
Again and again and again and again
We smash the game, buha!!
And again and again and again and again
Remember our name, Furyo 'til I die
Again and again and again and again
We smash the game, buha!!
And again and again and again and again
Remember our name, Furyo 'til I die
You might also likeI've been educated so I use the key
But to break the window, call me Jagi
I'm a big Lunatic, forgive me for that
White socks, white shoes, all dressed in black
My inner self tells me to find
A sensitive flow with a big fat sound
Write our story, represent our name
Forever, whatever, no matter the pain
To all the lovers, the haters
Ardent supporters
Since the beginning we play it fair
Follow the trend, we don't care
Again and again and again and again
We smash the game
And again and again and again and again
Remember our name, Furyo 'til I die
Again and again and again and again
We smash the game
And again and again and again and again
Remember our name, Furyo 'til I die
We came to the Stadium, play in Japan, here is the mission
After two years, Demonstrating our Saiya style in Tokyo, cheers
First album is out, there is a new big challenge to confront
Become a generation leader, here is the goal
Again and again and again and again
We smash the game, buha!!
And again and again and again and again
Remember our name, Furyo 'til I die
Again and again and again and again
We smash the game, buha!!
And again and again and again and again
Remember our name, Furyo 'til I dieEmbed
