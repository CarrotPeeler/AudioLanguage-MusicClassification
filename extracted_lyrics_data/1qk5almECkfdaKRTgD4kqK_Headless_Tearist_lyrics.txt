1 ContributorHeadless Statue Lyrics
By light we share our eyes
In the dark I won't look at you
Day bright, forgotten at night
When I dream of the headless statue

We share a pillow your soft hair entwined in mine
Buried in bone untouched roams the sovereign mind
Lying still, lying still and yet my blood still runs
Fleeing your warm body off to the cold no one

By light we share our eyes
In the dark I won't look at you
Day bright, forgotten at night
When I dream of the headless statue

We share a pillow your soft hair entwined in mine
Buried in bone untouched roams the sovereign mind
Lying still, lying still and yet my blood still runs
Fleeing your warm body off to the cold no one

Older than love
Return to stone
Nook of the nameless
Run me from home
You might also like
By light we share our eyes
In the dark I won't look at you
Day bright, forgotten at night
When I dream of the headless statue
By light we share our eyes
In the dark I won't look at you
Day bright, forgotten at night
When I dream of the headless statue
All I see is the headless statueEmbed
