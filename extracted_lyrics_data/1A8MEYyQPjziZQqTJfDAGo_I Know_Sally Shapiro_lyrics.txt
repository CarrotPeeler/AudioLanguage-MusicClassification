3 ContributorsI Know Lyrics
Goin' home
Thinkin' of you
I feel so alone
And I don't really know what to do
Time goes by
And when the raindrops fall from the sky
I know
That there's no reason why I should lie
A cup of tea
You gave me a ring
I know you care for me
And we can talk just about anything
Just tell me how
I can hold on to this moment for now
I want to keep this feeling somehow

I know you're my love, even though
Sometimes I believe
I will wake up from this dream
Because now
I fly high above of the clouds
I reach out for you
Or is it too good to be true?
You might also like
Because I know
Things happen so fast
And it makes me low
Because I feel that this won't last
But when you write
That you long for me in the night
I feel
That things are still quite alright
And then you say
You think of me all the time
You know it makes my day
I feel that you will always be mine
Just tell me how
I can hold on to this moment for now
I want to keep this feeling somehow

I know you're my love, even though
Sometimes I believe
I will wake up from this dream
Because now
I fly high above of the clouds
I reach out for you
Or is it too good to be true?
Just tell me how
I can hold on to this moment for now, now
I want to keep this feeling somehow

I know you're my love, even though
Sometimes I believe
I will wake up from this dream
Because now
I fly high above of the clouds
I reach out for you
Or is it too good to be true?
I know you're my love, even though
Sometimes I believe
I will wake up from this dream
Because now
I fly high above of the clouds
I reach out for you
Or is it too good to be true?1Embed
