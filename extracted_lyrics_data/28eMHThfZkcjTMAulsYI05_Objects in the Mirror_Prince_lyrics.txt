3 ContributorsObjects in the Mirror Lyrics
That's my favorite time with you
Just after we make a movie
The kind that requires
The title "Parental Advisory"
Let's brush our teeth in the same sink
Don't worry girl it's cool
We can pose in the mirror
I'm digging you digging on me digging on you

We hooked up now, I can try her
I can put my load in the dryer
So much we can share
The same height, weight, and body fluid
We hooked up now, we can do it
Been waiting baby
Been waiting baby
It's so hard to bear
The objects in the mirror
The objects in the mirror are closer
Than they appearYou might also likeEmbed
