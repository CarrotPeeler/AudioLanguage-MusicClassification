Though chaos reigns around you now
Only so much rain can fall at once
Breathe in
And let the air envelope you
And slow and sure serenity will come
Close your eyes
Try to breathe
Feel the ground
Beneath your feet
It's still there
The world still turns
Around
Stand up
Though circumstance has knocked you down
There is nothing gained by staying in its reach
Take strength
In every failure you endure
Our mistakes have many lessons they can teach
Close your eyes
Try to breathe
Feel the ground
Beneath your feet
It's still there
The world still turns
Around

These walls you've built around yourself
You can't take another step until they're gone
Move out
No use in dwelling in the past
Bid farewell to all your fears and carry on
Close your eyes
Try to breathe
Feel the ground
Beneath your feet
It's still there
The world still turns
Around
Close your eyes
Try to breathe
Feel the ground
Beneath your feet
It's still there
The world still turns
AroundEmbed
