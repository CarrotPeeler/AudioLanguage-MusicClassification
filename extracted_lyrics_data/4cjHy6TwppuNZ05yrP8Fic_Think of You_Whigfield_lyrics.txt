It Never was part of me
You got me reelin
Right into the heart of me
Don t keep me waitin
Cos I need your body tonight
I got me thinkin
My life it was endin
And when I was sinkin
I found me a friend and now
You got me singin
I need you inside me tonight - oh
When I think of you
I feel like flyin
Like a dream come true
Bad times are dying
When I think of you
I need your body tonight
With your affection
My life ain't the same
'Cos it's like resurrection
I'm callin your name
And you're close to perfection
And I need your body tonight - oh

When I think of you - oh
When I think of you
I need your body tonight
