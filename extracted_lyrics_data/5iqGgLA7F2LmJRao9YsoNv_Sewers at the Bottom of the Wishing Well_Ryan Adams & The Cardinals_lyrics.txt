2 ContributorsSewers at the Bottom of the Wishing Well Lyrics
No time to explain
Always hopeless in a hurry
There's no one to blame
For an empty heart

Well, well, well
Nothing's gonna change
I'm nothing but a quarter that fell
Into the sewers at the bottom of the wishing well

My heart isn't black
It's just dirty from the floors
Nobody walks across
Nobody walks across or sleeps on anymore

Well, well, well
Nothing's gonna change
Nothing's gonna change, oh well
Into the sewers at the bottom of the wishing well
Wishing well
Wishing well
Wishing well
Woo

Where the rats go to die, there's a dream
Where the rats go to die, there's a mountain of change
That used to belong to me
The sewers at the bottom of the wellEmbed
