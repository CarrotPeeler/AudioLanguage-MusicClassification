9 ContributorsJo-Joâ€™s Jacket Lyrics
"And in a funny way, the shaving of my, uh, head has been a liberation from, uh, a lot of, uh, stupid vanities really. Uh, it has simplified everything for me, it has opened a lot of doors maybe."

I'm not what you think I am
I'm the king of Siam
I've got a bald head
My name is Yul Brynner
And I am a famous movie star
Perhaps you saw me in Westworld
I acted like a robotic cowboy
It was my best role
I cannot deny I felt right home deep inside
That electronic carcass

Ah-lee eeh, ah-lee eeh eeh, ee-ee-eeh
Wooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Wooh ooh ooh ooh

You're such monumental slime
Let the punishment fit the crime
Tie it to a chair
The house music will blare
And turn your ears into
A medicinal jelly
You might also likeStay inside on Christmas Day
And make believe that you are my candy cane
You said, "I'm not that type
No I'm not sweet, and I'm not overripe
Do you like?

Ah-lee eeh, ah-lee eeh eeh, eeh
Wooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Wooh ooh ooh ooh
Ah-lee eeh, ah-lee eeh eeh, ee-ee-eeh
Wooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Wooh ooh ooh ooh

 Psycho disco

Ah-lee eeh, ah-lee eeh eeh, ee-ee-eeh
Wooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Wooh ooh ooh ooh
Ah-lee eeh, ah-lee eeh eeh, ee-ee-eeh
Wooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Wooh ooh ooh ooh

Bob Dylan sang in "Its alright mama I'm only bleeding"
Everything from toy guns that spark to flesh colored Christs that glow in the dark
Its easy to see we got in too far and not much is really sacredEmbed
