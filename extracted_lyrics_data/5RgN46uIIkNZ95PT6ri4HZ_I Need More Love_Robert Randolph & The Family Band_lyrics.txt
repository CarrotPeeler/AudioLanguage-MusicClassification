3 ContributorsI Need More Love LyricsAll of the cold winds blowing
Through our neighborhoods
While my frustration's growing
Through concrete, steel and wood
I need more love
I need more love every day of my life
I'm tired of feeling tension
Everyone's talking black and white
When will something change me
And help me get my mind right
I need more love
I need more loveYou might also likeEmbed
