18 ContributorsCiao! Lyrics
You got a two-day trial before I take back my time and make you pay
Thirty-day trial before I make my mind that it's a waste (Yeah)
Trials and tribulations (Oh, oh)
Ciao, ciao, ciao

Kissin' in Paris, I guess we could do it in French, wow
Eatin' lo mein, it's chow for now, chow, chow
She got me wildin' out
'Rari, Italia, ciao for now, ciao, ciao
Yeah, she makin' ass shake
Breakin' that bank 'til her back break, wow
Yeah, yeah

Crazy how you managed to make me into a sponsor
You got me payin' for shit

You got a two-day trial before I take back my time and make you pay
Thirty-day trial before I make my mind that it's a waste (Yeah)
Trials and tribulations (Oh, oh)
Ciao, ciao, ciao

She don't want Hallmark, she want Amex and I'm inclined
Facе card valid, no, I never press dеcline (Nah)
Took a month to make it to my lobby, it can't be prime (Nah)
Return policy, she can't be mine (Nah, nah)

Crazy how you managed to make me into a sponsor
You got me payin' for shit

You got a two-day trial before I take back my time and make you pay
Thirty-day trial before I make my mind that it's a waste (Yeah)
Trials and tribulations
Ciao, ciao, ciao


'Rari, Italia, ciao for now, ciao, ciao
She got me wildin' out, ciao, ciao, ciaoEmbed
