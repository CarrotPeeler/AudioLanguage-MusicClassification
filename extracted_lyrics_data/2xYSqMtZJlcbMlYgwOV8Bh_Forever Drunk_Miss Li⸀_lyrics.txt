1 ContributorForever Drunk LyricsI am stumblin' out of bed
With an aching head
Hip hurrays and yesterdays
Seem so far away
I've been wasting my time
Trying hard to ease the troubles of mine
Yes i've been wasting my time
All those lonely nights
Sun goes up and sun goes down
I can't feel the beat and
I can't hear the sound
Round and round all this killing
No i just can't stay forever drunk
Mirror mirror on the wall
Where did the good times go
Mirror mirror i don't know
What i'm living for so many nights
Stumblin' home like a lost little child
So many days curtains keeping the light away
Sun goes up and sun goes down
I can't feel the beat and
I can't hear the sound
Round and round all this killing time
No i just can't stay forever drunk

My heart was pure and my heart was all clean
But at twenty-three
I knew nothings what it seems, life ain't a dream
Sun goes up and sun goes down
I can't feel the beat and
I can't hear the sound
Round and round all this killing time
No i just can't stay forever drunkEmbed
