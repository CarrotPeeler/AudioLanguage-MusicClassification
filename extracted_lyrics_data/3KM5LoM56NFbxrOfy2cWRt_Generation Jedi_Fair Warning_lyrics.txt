(NO, TRY NOT
THERE IS NO TRY
DO OR DO NOT
UNLEARN WHAT YOU HAVE LEARNED)
We trade in the truth
Don't mind to spoil our youth
On comforts we feast
Lip service - a well known beast
We close our ears
We heard it all before
Dispel no fears
No one left to adore
When the times are changing
The visions fading
The walls are falling
When the tides are turning
The bridges burning
The world stops spinning
Around you

Underrated
I'm generation Jedi
And I hope there's some force to be with me
Intimidated
Educated
I'm generation Jedi
And I pray for the day there's a light to see
For the generation jedi
No good and no bad
Do we believe this lie
A world all gone mad
We kiss our minds goodbye
So how come twisted words of wisdom
Do make sense
Tales of kings and queens gives us confidence
Cause we're much too used to cheap pretense
Laugh about innocence
Truth is nothing but offense
Political correctness spoiled our common sense
And nothing makes a differenceEmbed
