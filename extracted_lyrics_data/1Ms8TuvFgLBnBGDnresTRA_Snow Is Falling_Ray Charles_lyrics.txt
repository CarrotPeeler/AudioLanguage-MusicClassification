1 ContributorSnow Is Falling Lyrics
Snow is falling, falling on the cold, cold ground
Snow is falling, baby, falling on the cold, cold ground
Gloom and misery, gloom and misery all around

I used to be so happy, now all I do is cry
Well, I used to be so happy, all I do is cry
Gonna buy myself a coffin, well, I'm gonna lay right down and die

Well, people, if I die tomorrow, who's gonna cry for me?
Lord, if I should die tomorrow, who's gonna cry for me?
Well, I ain't got nothing but these blues and misery

Well, I guess you better come and get me, ain't got nothing to lose
Oh, Lord, just come on and get me, ain't got nothing to lose
Well, I don't feel like living, life ain't nothing but the bluesYou might also likeEmbed
