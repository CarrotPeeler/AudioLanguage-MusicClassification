3 ContributorsHeart Of Misery LyricsI don't want to feel anything today
(I don't want to feel anything today)
Anything at all I'll just be alone
(I just want to know that you want to know)
I don't want to live through another day
(I don't want to live through another day)
Meaningless to fight for the victory
I just want to dive in the heart of misery
One love, One life
Lock me in the heart of misery
One Love, One fight
Lock me in the heart of misery
I will never be anything again
(I will never be anything again)
I'm tired to give, I don't want to try
(I'm afraid to live, I'm afraid to die)
I just want to fly, throw it all away
(I just want to fly, throw it all away)
Meaningless to fight for your sympathy
I just want to drown in the heart of misery
One love, One life
Lock me in the heart of misery
One Love, One fight
Lock me in the heart of misery

One heart refused to beat
One love is incomplete
One love, One life
Lock me in the heart of misery
One Love, One fight
Lock me in the heart of misery
Lock me in the heart of misery
Ah ah, ah ah
In the heart of misery
Ah ah, ah ah
In the heart of miseryEmbed
