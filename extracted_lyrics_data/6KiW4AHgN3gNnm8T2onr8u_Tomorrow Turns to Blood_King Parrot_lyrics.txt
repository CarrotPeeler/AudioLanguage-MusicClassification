1 ContributorTomorrow Turns to Blood LyricsBlood is building up around the eyes
Pressure starts to build up inside your mind
A creature in the shadows
Head erupts
Chokes a neck
Paramount threat
Sending astral body to the sky
Observant of the body from a height
A creature in the shadows eating flesh
Tomorrow turns to blood
Eternal rest
The clock is turning back a bit
The flesh is gone
Host escapes
Rabid dogs asphyxiate
Grinding you against the grain
Weeping bleeding screaming
When tomorrow turns to bloodYou might also likeEmbed
