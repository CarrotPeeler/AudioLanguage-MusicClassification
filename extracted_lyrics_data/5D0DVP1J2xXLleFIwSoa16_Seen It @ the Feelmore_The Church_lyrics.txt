1 ContributorSeen It @ the Feelmore LyricsHey man, think it through now
Why don't you stay for a while
Eve and Aurora gonna come on over
Know they'll make you smile
You should've seen it coming
Been coming for some time
You've got your broken heart
And I got mine
Yeah
You ain't gonna tell me that you were a saint
Every time you two were apart
You blew your chance
So face the music and dance
You should've seen it coming
Been coming for some time
You've got your broken heart
I got mine
Got mine
I got mine
You should've seen it coming
You've got your broken heart
And I feel fine (feel so fine)
Yeah (feel so fine)
(Feel so fine)
