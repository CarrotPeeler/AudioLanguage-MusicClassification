7 ContributorsBrave & Strong Lyrics
Well, well, well, well
Hey, hey, hey

Frightened faces to the wall
Oh, can't you hear your mama call?

The brave and strong survive, oh yeah

When you walk
Know where you're walking
When you talk, oh

Brave and strong survive

Out and down
Ain't got a friend
You don't know who turned you in

The brave and strong survive
The brave and strong survive
You might also like
Before me was a cowboy star
Indians
And there you are

The brave and strong survive
The brave and strong survive, child
The brave and strong survive
The brave, oh, and strong, oh survive
The brave, oh, and strong, oh survive1Embed
