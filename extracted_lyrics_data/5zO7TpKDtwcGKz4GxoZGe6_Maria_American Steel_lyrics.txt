1 ContributorMaria LyricsMaria, honey
They say these colors don't run
But they bleed in your face, like a bully spitting up a bad taste
After being knocked down a few pegs
You sigh as hard as a rock
It cuts your laugh lines absurd
I'm smiling with Irish eyes bloodshot
Christmas colored, you don't know what you've got
I'm falling apart at the seams
I'm mending this fifth of old age, just minding these six strings
It don't do me a damn that you got a pretty face, baby
It don't seem to you a damned thing
You got soothsayer nay-saying, you got soothsayer nay-saying
Red herrings never spoke to us
We don't believe in fate or metaphor
They got healing lips, but their tongues are poison tipped
Maria, the moment is right
To make them take a step back, take a step back
Maria on your quietest night
We'll make them rue the day they met you, Maria
I'm whistling with conviction
Like a young man in love
Like a young man with his pride on sale
Baby, join the club
You might also likeWell you're just darling
With your exclaimed travesties
It's a long road, it's a long road
So keep your chin up
You got soothsayer nay-saying, you got soothsayer nay-saying
Red herrings never spoke to us
We don't believe in fate or metaphor
They got healing lips, but their tongues are poison tipped
Maria, the moment is right
To make them take a step back, take a step back
Maria on your quietest night
We'll make them rue the day they met you, Maria
I once held a stone also
Staring at you naked and daring us to throw
Maria, you can see the good in everything
Now I know stones and bones fall from where they came from
Maria, the moment is right
To make them take a step back, take a step back
Maria on your quietest night
We'll make them rue the day they met you, MariaEmbed
