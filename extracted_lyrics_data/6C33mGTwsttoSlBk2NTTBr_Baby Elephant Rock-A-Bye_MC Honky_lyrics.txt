Baby elephant rock-a-bye
Baby elephant rock-a-bye
All the little girl elephants cry (Ooooo! Ooooo! Ooooooooo!)
I was wretched and fine as could be
I was wretched and fine as could be
Down, down, down
I was wretched
I was wretched
I was wretched
Baby elephant rock-a-bye
I was wretched
I was wretched
Down, down, down
Down, down, down
Baby elephant rock-a-bye
