1 ContributorNo Angel LyricsEveryone thinks they know me
They think they comprehend
Wake up and smell the coffee
I am not that innocent
Everybody tells me
That I should not believe
You're more than smoke & mirrors
But I am not that naïve
No no no
I'm no angel, I'm no angel
No no no
I'm no angel, anymore
This is now, this is me
I'm no angel, baby
This is now, this is me
I'm breaking free
Everyone says I'm falling
But they don't understand
I'm tired of choosing right from wrong
I'm not that innocent
Everybody tells me
I'm bound to be deceived
But I don't need protection
'cause I am not that naïveYou might also likeEmbed
