3 Contributors1985 LyricsAnother night, said i have to calm down
Another day, be another red light... yeahhh
I heard the sounds see i heard this on the one tell me
In my hand, whoaaaa-oh, your hand
And everytime we stop see you get a little fill its all over there
I know i know
I waited on the feelin' i waited all the time
I hate the sort of feeling when there's someone else in mind
And its the time for killing
By hearing all the time
Drive me out of line (fashion), and i was color-blind
What do what i hear you say
Maybe never want it see at all, noooooo
It sounds like a mind too empty findin' in my hand
Whoaaa-oh your hand
And we got out just barely alive
Ahh-ahh-ahh-ahh-ahh-ahh-ahh
I waited on the feelin' i waited all the time
I hate the sort of feeling when there's someone else in mind
And its the time for killing
By hearing all the time
Another notice, out on the phone-line
(line clashes wonder what catches)
Do you want to hang this, me on the clothes-line
(now im feeling... really such a fine time)
