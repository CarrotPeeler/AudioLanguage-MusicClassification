15 ContributorsFucked Up World Lyrics
Back door bitches begging me to behold
All their cash and cars, platinum, silver and gold
We're like diamonds in the sky, that is what we are told
No mountain made of money can buy you a soul

Baby ooh, I can see it
Ooh, I can see it
Ooh, I can see it
Coming down
And ooh, I can see it
Ooh, I can see it
Ooh, I can see it
Coming down

It's a fucked up world, what do you get?
Sex and love and guns, light a cigarette
A fucked up world, what do you get from it?
Sex and love and guns, light a cigarette
Sex and love and guns, light a cigarette

Banging little boys bugging me on the bus
Say they wanna know who did it, but the answer's really us
See, I don't know you, why do you wanna know me?
You ain't getting what you want unless you're getting it for free
You might also like
And baby ooh, I can feel it
Ooh, I can feel it
Ooh, I can feel it
Coming down
And ooh, I can feel it
Ooh, I can feel it
Ooh, I can feel it
Coming down

It's a fucked up world, what do you get?
Sex and love and guns, light a cigarette
A fucked up world, what do you get from it?
Sex and love and guns, light a cigarette
Sex and love and guns, light a cigarette
Sex and love and guns, light a cigarette
Oh yeah

Ooh
Back to these backdoor bitches begging me to behave
Jamming Jesus down my throat, no, I don't wanna be saved
Ain’t a chain on my brain, I’m nobody's slave
I got one foot in the cradle and one in the grave
It's a fucked up world
Sex and love and guns, light a cigarette
Fucked up world, what do you get from it?
Sex and love and guns, light a cigarette
Sex and love and guns, light a cigarette
Sex and love and guns, light a cigarette

It's a fucked up world... guns, light a cigarette
It's a fucked up world... guns, light a cigarette
It's a fucked up world... guns, light a cigarette
It's a fucked up world... guns, light a cigarette
It's a fucked up world... guns, light a cigarette
It's a fucked up world... guns, light a cigarette
It's a fucked up world... guns, light a cigarette
It's a fucked up world... guns, light a cigarette
It's a fucked up world
It's a fucked up world4Embed
