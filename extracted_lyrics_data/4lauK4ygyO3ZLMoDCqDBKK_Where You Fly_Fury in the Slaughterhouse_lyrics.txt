1 ContributorBeastmode Workout (Trap Mix) Lyrics

Yeah, Lupah Phaiym remix

Woke up again with them thoughts in my head
Looking for strangers and leaving 'em dead
I don't know why that I think of this shit
Look at your neck, I'ma perfectly slit
Perfectly normal, a good human being
But no one can tell me the shit that I'm seeing
Visions and pictures drawn up in my brain
Cannot control and I cannot refrain
I could be good or I could be the bad guy
I could see dubs or I could see the blood fly
It don't really matter, my knife is in your bladder
Put your head down, watch your brain go splatter
That's just me, see, mine like a frisbee
Spinning all across the room, somebody help me
I don't know what to do
I got a mind for the madness and I wanna kill you

This is my mind and it's gone
Feel it when I kill it when I write this song
This is my mind and it's gone
Psycho, I know I'ma kill 'em all
This is my mind and it's gone
Feel it when I kill it when I write this song
This is my mind and it's gone
Psycho, I know I'ma kill 'em all
You might also like
Violent mechanical, silent but animal
Beast of the week as they call me The Manimal
I am the scientist back from the lions pit
God amongst men when I unleash the fire, spit
Back in effect and I'm rocking your style
Cali-connected, I've been here a while
Text and we flexing and bringing the pain
The weapon is kept in the heart of the flame
Season our demons, we flowing with reason
Your treason impeding will lead to your bleeding
I am a killer, I am insane
I have been brought here to sever your brain
I am a hustler, stay on my grind
I am eternal, a stain on your mind
I know it will be the proponent of hate
The moment you spoke you have sealed up your fate

This is my mind and it's gone
Feel it when I kill it when I write this song
This is my mind and it's gone
Psycho, I know I'ma kill 'em all
This is my mind and it's gone
Feel it when I kill it when I write this song
This is my mind and it's gone
Psycho, I know I'ma kill 'em all
This is my mind and it's gone
When I pull up on a hater, kill 'em, M.A.D. a vagabond
I'm the king on the beat, yeah it's best to be advised hoe
Pull a 1-8-7 on the 5-0
Anything West Coast, we just ride slow
Smoking on the fire, we got bodies in the trunk mo'
They'll be done-zo, guns out the front door
Madopelli kill it, ain't a soul that we run from
This is my mind and I think that it's gone
As I'm drinking redrum and my eyes feel the glow
I am a killer running the streets
Smash in yo head as I'm strapped to the beat (Woo)
I am psychotic, I'm taking your oxygen
Nothing can stop me, I'm definitely slashing yo abdomen (Slice)
A serial killer, chainsaw bloody, Madopelli with the splitter

This is my mind and it's gone
Feel it when I kill it when I write this song
This is my mind and it's gone
Psycho, I know I'ma kill 'em all
This is my mind and it's gone
Feel it when I kill it when I write this song
This is my mind and it's gone
Psycho, I know I'ma kill 'em all

JP in the house and I do it all the time
With the fluid in your mouth, getting drunk is on my mind
Got a brew in my hand and the music and a rhyme
So drunk as a skunk I forgot my next line (Ugh)
Use a Pocket Mix and affix to the G
And it's filled to the rim, got an ish eating grin
And it feels so good, how the hell it be a sin?
And I'm one sip away from pissing in the wind
Drunk in public with a bucket of nugget
Gonna smoke it and dutch it
Can I hold it and clutch it?
Gonna puff it and grub
Jello shots in the tub and I'm sucking 'em up
You got a pocket of bud, I got a box of the Buds
Slyzwicked with the nachos, Habanero hot sauce
Three damn bowls and a handful
 passed out on the couch and he's talking to himself with Taquitos in his mouth

And we do it for my west coast people
Yes, for my east coast people
And we do it for the south side people
Yes, for my north side people
And we do it for my west coast people
Yes, for my east coast people
And we do it for the south side people
Yes, for my north side people

We get the party cracking
You feeling it when we rapping
You feeling it when that beat drops and when the bass is slapping
I do it for my people that I love and keep it peaceful
Part of my success is to keep it plugged into my cerebral
From the days that are vile, we got loud
Riverside keep it buzzing, the underground's where we keep it live
We're dabbing hands and popping them PBR cans
From that, working and compensating them next plans
So, come along if you wanna get down with us
Hoe, where you at? Throw it up, rep yo town with us
We coming through, nothing to lose to a city near you
I see you haters in the back all up in my rearview
It's been a minute so I'ma get it and I'm all up in it
We looking to leave an impression on your mind, you won't forget it
So, come on and vibe with us doing our cathedral
You call them fan supporters, I call them my people

And we do it for my west coast people
Yes, for my east coast people
And we do it for the south side people
Yes, for my north side people
And we do it for my west coast people
Yes, for my east coast people
And we do it for the south side people
Yes, for my north side people

I do it for my people, driving dirty always
Driving illegal, Queen Victoria looking so regal
I ain't talking Chris Kringle but got enough presents for everyone
Party has arrived, once I show up on the scene
Open your mouth wide then we pouring it in
And you know we getting high, drinking, causing a scene
Up all night, yeah, you know what I mean
Sometimes you just gotta say fucker take it to the head
See, you look and don't gotta pretend 'cause I'm looking like a ten
Got you excited like you pitching a tent
You can find me in the smoke circle or the floor, yeah
I'm getting it in, doing my thing
Don't mean to offend, we got enough money and paraphernalia to cover the rent
Time is never wasted when you're wasted
But you die happy, we got time to spend

And we do it for my west coast people
Yes, for my east coast people
And we do it for the south side people
Yes, for my north side people
And we do it for my west coast people
Yes, for my east coast people
And we do it for the south side people
Yes, for my north side people

Slyzwicked, JP, Insane Loc
Yeah, Beastmode, check it, yo, uh

Right off the top so I'm gonna put it like this
It's all work and no play, the way I handle by biz
24/7-365 now that's Beastmode, feast mode, way we survive (Uh)
We living that grind and hustle, that's how we build our muscle
We got the ice in our veins, shout out to D. Russell
We spitting that high octane, we in our own lane
Ain't no question when you hear the name, we got that propane
I've never worried about what the next man is doing
I'm busy focusing on myself with the path that I'm choosing
I'm assuming and proving I'm gonna be killing that mic and using
We keeping it real out here, this ain't no faking music

When them haters wanna buck but they never wanna walk tell 'em
Worry about your own, worry about your own
When they all up in your biz and they don't know what it is, tell 'em
Worry about your own, worry about your own
When them haters wanna pause but they never wanna rock tell 'em
Worry about your own, worry about your own
When they all up in your biz and they don't know what it is, tell 'em
Worry about your own, worry about your own

I'm on my hustle, got my focus, I'm a paper maker
Outer space, shooting higher than a skyscraper
And I'm a risk taker, never stuck or staying still
And I'ma hit, make a beast until I get my kill
I'm trying to get my fill feasting on you lightweights
I'm getting head like a Beastie Boy, nice and swank
I'm mad walking, you trash talking and hand jocking
You non-stopping the flip-flopping, you jizz-socking
I'm Stephen Hawking and Steve Jobs in the same body
Why you talking to me? You just a nobody
I'm here to rock your party and elevate your mind
I wanna show you what it's like when you on the grind
I'm educated and emulated and imitated
I'm replicated and simulated but never faded
I'm never satiated, tapeworm appetite
My hunger's deep, I'ma kill it with the mental might

When them haters wanna buck but they never wanna walk tell 'em
Worry about your own, worry about your own
When they all up in your biz and they don't know what it is, tell 'em
Worry about your own, worry about your own
When them haters wanna pause but they never wanna rock tell 'em
Worry about your own, worry about your own
When they all up in your biz and they don't know what it is, tell 'em
Worry about your own, worry about your own

When grown folks is talking, better shut the fuck up
Take yo ass to the kiddy table and finish yo lunch
I spit game for them hustlers, pimps, and the MAC's
Them real go-getters out here moving them packs
Keep your nose in your own biz, stay up out of mine
Cause when you're out of line then your life's out of time
Running like some bad brakes, no mistakes though
You late with the dough you're laced with a halo
No fable, these streets been watching
Any avenue a option, I'm plotting
Focused on a caper to get the paper
Erase a hater with a razor for a favor
Howdy neighbor, make sure you keep your distance
You worry about your own, mind your damn business
In an instance I could make your blood bleed
Insane Loc motherfucker, keep it sludgy

When them haters wanna buck but they never wanna walk tell 'em
Worry about your own, worry about your own
When they all up in your biz and they don't know what it is, tell 'em
Worry about your own, worry about your own
When them haters wanna pause but they never wanna rock tell 'em
Worry about your own, worry about your own
When they all up in your biz and they don't know what it is, tell 'em
Worry about your own, worry about your own


I'm diabolical, music pumping, unstoppable
Finger douching you pussies, I'm anti-gynecological
Quitting is never optional, ripping it through the audible
Never spitting that monotone autotune, yeah, I'm mocking ya
Boxcutter collab, we sharpen it like a diamond pack
Stick it through your ear with the flour, we're bringing grinding back
We bringing rhyming back, we spit that viral crack
We fuck with bitches who need a rock just to show you rack
We on the flat bench, pushing, we a powerhouse
You count for nothing so we take you to the slaughterhouse
Your label factory farms, we here to shut it down
We spit miraculous bombs, we letting off a round
Cross-country connecting dots, we on the move
Y'all bitches quicksand, treadmill lead shoes
We dark down and we hunting it just to get our due
We all bounded by life, we trying to get through

We gon' light this, burning up the nitrous
We gon' fight, gettin' crunk to this hype shit
You gon' like this, watch how we mic rip
We gon' fight, gettin' crunk to this hype shit
We gon' light this, burning up the nitrous
We gon' fight, gettin' crunk to this hype shit
You gon' like this, watch how we mic rip
We gon' fight, gettin' crunk to this hype shit

I grab that mic to destroy and lyrically demolish
I kick the knowledge, I'm eating rappers they straight abolish
You just a novice, I'm being honest, I'm Nostradamus
It's catastrophic, I'm prophecising on different topics
I'm shining across the sky, I am that Halley's Comet
I'm dropping a cancerous flow, we'll take your heart, stop it
See we are not the equal at least in my cerebral
I'm jumping up on the stage, I realize it's my cathedral
I'm at the podium, I'm causing pandemonium
I lyrically spit the type of venom, man, there's no controlling him
See, I was meant for this, to speak with the verbal sentences
I be that fire-breathing lyrical rhyming specialist
See in my consciousness, I'm not a beast, I'm monstrous
You try to kill us on a beat? Boy, now that's preposterous
See this is confidence, it's bringing out my dominance
I just body a flow and put it in my sarcophagus

We gon' light this, burning up the nitrous
We gon' fight, gettin' crunk to this hype shit
You gon' like this, watch how we mic rip
We gon' fight, gettin' crunk to this hype shit
We gon' light this, burning up the nitrous
We gon' fight, gettin' crunk to this hype shit
You gon' like this, watch how we mic rip
We gon' fight, gettin' crunk to this hype shit

You was ridiculed, brought out the raging bull, part of a mouth full
Who wanna box with the kangaroo? You get cooked at the left side of stovetops
Critical, flammable, my modern rivals come with the tactical
You lack satirical, fight the beast, we Lord of the Rings
Took off your fingers, put you through the ringer, drug you through the mud
Come up like swamp things, couple mad hounds, I spit the mad cow disease
You in disbelief, you ain't gonna cease, lost me in translation
Flow is variation, this is victorious, rogue warriors on chariots
We rode in, Trojans, atrocious, glorious
Carry inventory, black crow, ferocious
Aristo, move brutal, black Crisco, niggas is simple
Lackluster, come with the impact of the proton pack from Ghostbusters
Niggas try to move on us
We make adjustments in the highest summits
Straight down 300 feet you plummet
You get punished, Beastmode Warriors, we coming
We mad animals out of the cage, see the fury light up like lava

We gon' light this, burning up the nitrous
We gon' fight, gettin' crunk to this hype shit
You gon' like this, watch how we mic rip
We gon' fight, gettin' crunk to this hype shit
We gon' light this, burning up the nitrous
We gon' fight, gettin' crunk to this hype shit
You gon' like this, watch how we mic rip
We gon' fight, gettin' crunk to this hype shit


La Plaga
Lupah Phaiym remix
Bottoms up

I'm coming from the bottom where the cereal's for dinner
Mom's smoked out, pops cheating, every day sinner
Now, everybody tryna get they first nut on printer
And jail ain't nothing but a high-school sitter
Now, ink to the mind, staple "'38s the class"
Always trying to holler bitches with an ass
On the corner hustling, kept the stash in the trash
Motherfucker the police, middle finger as they pass
And it's cash or delivery, pockets like Best Buy
Any drug you want, kept the fiends with the best high
New Jordan's, new jeans, little nigga dressed fly
Anybody snitch get murdered, even the best die
Trying to make it out the hood has always been the hardest part
Easy to be bad than be good in my heart-to-heart
Hard to stay positive nigga when your heart is dark
Hood makes me real, all I know is where I got my heart

I'm coming from the bottom where we always had it rough
Was barely getting by 'cause we never had enough
The tough gets going when the going gets tough
The grind don't stop 'til the top bottoms up
'Cause I'm coming from the bottom where we always had it rough
Was barely getting by 'cause we never had enough
The tough gets going when the going gets tough
The grind don't stop 'til the top bottoms up

I'm coming from the bottom, bootleg felt so real
Food stamps for money, necessary, pay some bills
Brothers on that bottom for my book-bag never knew (Nah)
Waters, groceries, having Gs to post-mill
Crown City, Corona, yeah, we built it like Daytona (Haha)
Freaks in every street, la vecina in the corner
Even sunny day drown on puddles of blood
5-0 killed the king, killed the Crip, killed the Blood
El Rio de La Nave 

I'm coming from the bottom where we always had it rough
Was barely getting by 'cause we never had enough
The tough gets going when the going gets tough
The grind don't stop 'til the top bottoms up
'Cause I'm coming from the bottom where we always had it rough
Was barely getting by 'cause we never had enough
The tough gets going when the going gets tough
The grind don't stop 'til the top bottoms up


I'm coming from the bottom where we always had it rough
Was barely getting by 'cause we never had enough
The tough gets going when the going gets tough
The grind don't stop 'til the top bottoms up
'Cause I'm coming from the bottom where we always had it rough
Was barely getting by 'cause we never had enough
The tough gets going when the going gets tough
The grind don't stop 'til the top bottoms up


Lupah Phaiym on the beat

I'm on a murderous mission without remorse and I
Steady stabbing you suckers, stay off my course 'cause you
Ain't on my level, I'm devilish, I'm the serpent god
I strike you down, I'm delivering with the fire rod
And now you sounding all violent, I will decapitate you
I let me venom possess you then I reanimate you
I will debilitate you, lay you in a voodoo trance
With my legion of creatures, we will begin to dance
Upon your grave as we desecrate you living being
Body parts will be severed with certain death creeping
You hear my Ohmi march, stomping through your backyard
Watch a fire spark burning through your front yard
I pull the trump card, in the blaze you've been fired
Oven roasting you vegetables so get defiled
My thoughts so vile and venomous I need a victim
I got my devil dogs, let 'em loose and watch 'em sicc 'em(Ugh)

I will kill y'all
Put a hole in your head, I will drill y'all
I'm sick in the head, I will fill y'all
Full of holes and the cold blood spill out
I will kill y'all
Put a hole in your head, I will drill y'all
I'm sick in the head, I will fill y'all
Full of holes and the cold blood spill out

I'm the hardest alive, marching from the dark to the light
After the barking and bite, scoffing the heart of the sky
Was starving, I'm carving the skies from a carcass, so I
Beg your pardon, jargon is fly, got body pickpockets supply
I got a heart of a lion, every time he starting to die
That part of nine atom monsters at the stars in the skies
I paw through your eye, brains make me smarter and wise
Pulled apart, surprised you slain in the garbage with flies
In a margin life is walking through the park in the night
Seen a guard and he's like shit-talking, I see him gargling, right
Let out the carbon as I stab you with words sharper than knives
Chop off the top like a barber then drop you off the harbor to a lie
Got barbed wire, electrifier, a sword to swing nice
Hardcore, so be advised, with force we neck slice
Put your corpse up on the ice, my purpose to dissect
Of course I kill y'all last so who's gonna die next
And I

I will kill y'all
Put a hole in your head, I will drill y'all
I'm sick in the head, I will fill y'all
Full of holes and the cold blood spill out
I will kill y'all
Put a hole in your head, I will drill y'all
I'm sick in the head, I will fill y'all
Full of holes and the cold blood spill out

I'm just a natural born killer so you know what my aim is
Got this stainless serrated blade and I'm aiming for faces
I spent my life behind bars, I ain't afraid to catch cases
It's GRE and Murder Musick, leaving bodies in showcases
And demonstrating what happens to haters who try to fade us
They about to be in the ground for real and just sleeping with the potatoes
We armed and dangerous, craniums gon' get caved in
Your metal detector won't stop me from bringing this gauge in
'Cause if security steps in, fuck it, I spray them
If we in this bitch don't be thinking you fucking safe then
I'll take ten of your best men and break them
Devastating, I'm God forsaken, descendant of Satan
I'm contemplating decapitating you bastards faking
I'm an Undertaker, I'm undefeated, you wack and wasted
Grab you very casually, slicing you into slabs of bacon
Fuck all that talking man, you 'bout to feel my wrath and hatred

I will kill y'all
Put a hole in your head, I will drill y'all
I'm sick in the head, I will fill y'all
Full of holes and the cold blood spill out
I will kill y'all
Put a hole in your head, I will drill y'all
I'm sick in the head, I will fill y'all
Full of holes and the cold blood spill out

Throw your hands up, put 'em high in the sky
Bottles and cans up, dab until you getting high
We on the party drink app, man, party man
We dropping bombs on these females, getting laid
We finish getting paid, now it's time to cut loose
In the morning got a peace sign for the deuce
Gotta get back, grinding on my paper stack
Finding work, I don't eat, I ain't having that
I'm my own man, paying bills, paying rent
Then the next week do it all over again

We have a good time, let the mood ride
West Coast, lemon Cali made in the sunshine
We have a good time on the West side
West Coast, lemon Cali shade do it all the time

We came to get, you'll have a real good time baby
So, come on and get down, loose the frown
Put them dubs up high, where you at? Rep your town

Tryna bring drama this way, nah, save it
Feeling real good inside so I embrace it
I kick back, lay back in the sunshine
Put them drinks up, we just here to have a good time

We have a good time, let the mood ride
