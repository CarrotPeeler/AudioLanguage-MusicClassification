6 ContributorsThrow Your Arms Around Me Lyrics
I will come for you at night time
I will raise you from your sleep
I will kiss you in four places
As I go running along your street
I will squeeze the life out of you
You will make me laugh and make me cry
We will never forget it
You will make me call your name and I'll shout it to the blue summer sky

We may never meet again
So shed your skin and lets get started
And you will throw your arms around me
You will throw your arms around me

I dreamed of you at night time
And I watched you in your sleep
I met you in high places
I touched your head and touched your feet
So if you disappear out of view
You know, I will never say goodbye
Though I try to forget it
You will make me call your name and I'll shout it to the blue summer sky
You might also like
We may never meet again
So shed your skin and lets get started
And you will throw your arms around me
Yeah, you will throw your arms around me
You will throw your arms around me
Yeah, you will throw your arms around me
We may never meet again
Your arms around me
Yeah, we may never meet again
Your arms around me
Yeah, we may never meet again
Your arms around me
Yeah, we may never meet again
Your arms around meEmbed
