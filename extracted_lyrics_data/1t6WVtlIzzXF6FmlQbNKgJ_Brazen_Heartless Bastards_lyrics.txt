Spots of twilight gone
I been held by the wounds that speak
That speak with bitter tongue
Things eclipsing all the time
For better and worse alike
I always learn the hard way
An instinct to be true
An instinct to be true
And I'm gonna tell this world
The only difference now is that I'm vigilant
And I'm gonna spread my wings
'Cause I am vigilant, not gonna take no shit
And I, I was walkin' on a fire
Coals beneath my feet
The smoke has risen up
And nearly suffocated me
Things eclipsing all the time
For better and worse alike
I always learn the hard way
An instinct to be true
An instinct to be true

The only difference now is that I'm vigilant
And I'm gonna spread my wings
'Cause I am vigilant, not gonna take no shit
And oh, and everywhere I go
Takin' with that same new feeling with me now
It get me through my ups and downs
And everywhere I go
Takin' with that same new feeling with me now
It get me through my ups and downs
I'm wide awake
I'm wide awake
I'm wide awakeEmbed
