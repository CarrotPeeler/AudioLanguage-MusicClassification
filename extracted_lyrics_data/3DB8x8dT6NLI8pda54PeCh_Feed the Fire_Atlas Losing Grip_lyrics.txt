1 ContributorFeed The Fire LyricsThis is one thing that is constant
And I keep crawling back here every time I fall
It is the pillar I rest my hope on
This is my life-blood, this is my all...
Call it what you want, it don't bother me
Hearts permeated and soiled with envy - time and time again
Tried to strip me of my dignity
But despiteful words can no longer hurt me
And if you thought so
You're dumber than I did ever give you credit for
So many times I took the beatings
Physically and mentally punched through the god-damned floor
Foul means to brake my self-esteem
To crush and crumble a young boys dream
But the winds have changed
And all the shit you throw my way, blows right back in your face!
All the harsh words - Feed the fire!
All the hatred - Feed the fire!
The condescending eyes - Feed the fire!
Every time I'm patronized I rise up higher
While they feed the fire!
YOU CAN'T BREAK ME!You might also likeEmbed
