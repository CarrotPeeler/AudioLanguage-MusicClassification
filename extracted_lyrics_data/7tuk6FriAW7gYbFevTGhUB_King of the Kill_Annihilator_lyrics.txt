I'm judge and jury, your life I decide
I have awakened for my nightly feast
A reign of terror, beware of the beast
Don't try to run, there's no way to survive
A vicious surrender, I'll eat you alive
No one is safe until I get my fill
All hear my warning, I'm king of the
Kill!
Stalking the land for the scent of my prey
Stopping for nothing, don't get in my way
Left to the vultures, your life is denied
I rule the jungle, I rule it with pride
Don't try to run, there's no way to survive
A vicious surrender, I'll eat you alive
No one is safe until I get my fill
All hear my warning, I'm king of the
Kill!
Don't try to run, there's no way to survive
A vicious surrender, I'll eat you alive
No one is safe until I get my fill
All hear my warning, I'm king of the kill!
