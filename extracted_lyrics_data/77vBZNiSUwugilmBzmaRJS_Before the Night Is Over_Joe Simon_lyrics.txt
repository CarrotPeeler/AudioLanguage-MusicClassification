Take my hand and roll with me, my love
Don't be afraid
Before the night is over, we'll be in love
Before the night is over, we'll be in love

Don't be afraid
I can tell that you feel a little lonely too
And there is someone, someone you need to forget, girl
It's the same thing I've been thinking
Why don't we just make-believe that is not the first time?

Before the night is over, we'll be in love
By the morning I'll be the only one you're thinking of
Slowly it'll come together
Closer than a finger in a glove
Before the night is over, we'll be in love (No doubt about it, baby)
Before the night is over, we'll be in love (I know we'll be in love)

You don't have to be abused or misused by no one
Just give me another chance girl
And I'll prove my love to you 'cause
I can tell, I can tell someone been hurting you
You could use a little tenderness and I'm willing to give it to you
But if you think I'm wrong
And if I'm coming on too strong
Just let me know, I'll totally leave you alone
You might also like
Before the night is over, we'll be in love
By the morning I'll be the only one you're thinking of
Slowly we'll come together
Closer than a finger in a glove
Before the night is over, we'll be in love (No doubt about it, baby)
Before the night is over, we'll be in love (I know we'll be in love)
Before the night is over, we'll be in love (No doubt about it, baby)
Just give me the chance to prove my love to you

Before the night is over, we'll be in love
Before the night is over, we'll be in love1Embed
