6 ContributorsDead in a Year Lyrics("We gonna do a song that you never heard before.")

I'm your number one suspect cause I wear black Locs
Took my hat back and choked on weed smoke
You call me a ghetto thug but I say "Damn you"
I'ma live my life just how I want to
I'm out there bad, like a madman, the savage
You can't manage with that, I'm doing some kind of damage
I'm in a ghetto street spotlight
I'm always loc'ed down and always high as a kite
Now every day is like somebody's watching me
Gotta get my 9-millimeter 'fore they cap on me
They be be coming up quick, this number one suspect
Ain't no punk, go pop ya trunk, go grab ya pump
I ain't about to be put to rest
Cause this young black ghetto thug ain't expired yet
I'm strong with no fear
They said I'd be dead in a year

I used to roll in them rental cars with a trunk full of OZ's
Droppin' them thangs off, sometimes they were whole ki's
Me as my brother's parents, now he runs with the Killa Klan
And my nigga K.B., now he's a family man
Solo solo chemistry, my mind started building
 that's when I started thinkin' millions
That's when I got agg, bought me a A.K. and punching bag
And gamed the squad game and a perfect aim in a nigga's ass
See, my solution was to take
Any god damn thing I wanted even if I had to break
A nigga's mothafucking ass down
With these hard-hitting hands or with them automatic rounds
Shit, within no time I had a lot of people scared
Cause the whole damn city found out jacking wasn't dead
And a lot of jealous ass-niggas and hoes
Said I would be dead in a year but that was two years ago
And I'm still living
You might also like
Everybody's living in a world of crooked thoughts
I've been criming for years, with no fears of getting caught
I'm always labeled as a suspect, snatching gold
Stealing clothes outta stores before they open their doors
I'm struggling, thinking crime gonna help
I brought a child in this world but I can barely feed my damn self
Water and bread, who gonna keep the kid fed?
Jacking ain't dead because of my little mark ass
Me and Sho at your do' about fo' o'clock
Whoever answers the do' gonna get robbed and shot
Icy Hott wasn't made for the minimum wage
Therefore I grabbed my gauge and got my ass paid
I got popped by a chink at the corner store
Staring at me from the time I walked through the door
He thought I ran out his store with a beer
He shot me in my back and I was dead in a year

Said I'd be dead in a year, I won't see twenty-one come
And at the rate I'm going out, G Rapp will be my mother's only son
Said I'd never be shit, just another nigga in the pen
But I get mo' money, spend that and get paid again
Left my books to be a crook, left my job just to rob
How ya gonna tell Lil Flea how to live when times get hard?
Be myself, so I did, I need help, I sold drugs
Cause all I ever really knew were crooks and thugs
I was down from the heart, cracking cars til ya start
Take it to the back of my hood to undress the fucking parts
Every time I've seen a cop, I got a bad thought
Like breakin 'em down the middle like a half ounce
And ya life for tomorrow it wasn't no guarantee
Cause ain't a nigga got a life-time warranty
And I know them hoes sick that we still here
Ain't gonna be living to blow out our candles next year2Embed
