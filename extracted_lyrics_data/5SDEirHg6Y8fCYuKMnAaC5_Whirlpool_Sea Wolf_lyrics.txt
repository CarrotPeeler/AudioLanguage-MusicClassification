Tugging at my limbs so heavy
Dragging me down again
Into the depths of cold blue water?
But don't believe me, I swear this isn't me
I just want to feel the sunlight
Warm and soothing on my naked skin
So I'm hoping this cold blue water scrubs me clean
Oh my one, I swear I'm trying
What good would it do lying?
Oh my one, I swear I'm trying
What good would it do lying?
Saw something in the shadows
Tricked me into the shallows
Saw something in the shadows
Tricked me into the shallows
What is this pulling
Tugging at my limbs so heavy
Dragging me down again?
So I'm hoping, this cold blue water
Scrubs me clean and spits me out again
Because I just want to feel the sunlight
Warm and soothing

Saw something in the shadows
Tricked me into the shallows
Saw something in the shadows
Tricked me into the shallows
Oh my one, I swear I'm trying
What good would it do lying?
Oh my one, I swear I'm trying
What good would it do lying?
Saw something in the shadows
Tricked me into the shallows
Saw something in the shadows
Tricked me into the shallows
Saw something in the shadows
Tricked me into the shallows
Saw something in the shadows
Tricked me into the shallowsEmbed
