5 ContributorsSomething Good LyricsWoke up this morning feeling fine
There’s something special on my mind
Last night I met a new guy
In the neighbourhood
Oh yeah
Something tells me I’m into something good
He’s the kind of guy who’s not too shy
And I can tell he’s my kinda guy
He danced close too me
Like I hoped he would
Oh yeah
Something tells me I’m into something good
We only danced for a minute or two
He stuck to me the whole night through
Last night we fell in love
He’s everything I’m dreaming of
Something tells me I’m into something good
We only danced for a minute or two
He stuck to me the whole night through
Last night we fell in love
He’s everything I’m dreaming of
He walked me home and I held his hand
I knew it couldn’t be just a one night stand
So I asked to see him again
And he said I could
Something tells me I’m into something good
Something tells me I’m into something good
Something good
Oh yeah
Something good
Something good
Oh yeah
Something goodYou might also likeEmbed
