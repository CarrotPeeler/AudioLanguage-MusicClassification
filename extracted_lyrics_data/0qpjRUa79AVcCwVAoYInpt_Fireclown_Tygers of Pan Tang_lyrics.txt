His eyes wide open with madman's zeal
Reborn the fire to life's ordeals
Reborn the fire to life's ordeals
See his eyes they tell no lies
See his eyes he's going to die
His mind's on fire, his suit is warm
His brain is boiling, his life is torn
The heart of the sunrise is drawing him on
The soul of the universe is drawing him on
See his eyes they tell no lies
See his eyes he's going to die
See his eyes they tell no lies
See his eyes he's going to die
His mind is wandering, there's no time left
The heart of the future will soon oppress
His thoughts of home and happiness
His thoughts of home and happiness
See his eyes they tell no lies
See his eyes he's going to dieYou might also likeEmbed
