3 ContributorsWithout You LyricsYou say, you found, your calling
Now you need, to be, alone
And then step away from falling
Please tell me is that really all
Then this will be
Your big mistake
You'll never find another who will love you like me
You'll never find another who will truly care
And if you make my poor heart break
Later on I wanna find a way to fix it
But it will mend
Without you
Think it's the answer
That you've got, it all, figured out
You think this change is change for the better
But this change is change for the worse
Haven't you ever put your feelings first
Then this will be
Your big mistake
You'll never find another who will love you like me
You'll never find another who will truly care
And if you make
My poor heart break
Later on I wanna find a way to fix it
But it will mend
Without you
