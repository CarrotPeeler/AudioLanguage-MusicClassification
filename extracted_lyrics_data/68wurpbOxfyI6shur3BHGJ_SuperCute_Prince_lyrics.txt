6 ContributorsSupercute Lyrics
She arrived on a 747
About 20 to 11
She comes to see him
Him as in me
She comes to see
And it's never complicated
Other women cannot fade it
Whenever I call
She gets dressed up and all

Supercute
Maybe it's cause
She comes from East L.A
But every time I see her body on display
I gotta call her name from the DJ booth
Strobe light flash
And you know the truth
Baby got game
She'll take your loot
Keys to the crib
With no dispute
See her dancing in her birthday suit
Supercute
You might also like
Together we wonder
How we got enslaved and why
It's time to get freedom for our people
And Jericho falls when we all discern the lie
Yo, why the man wanna lie?
I look at her eyes
Go wild, she smiles

Supercute
Maybe it's cause
She comes from East L.A
But every time I see her body on display
I gotta call her name from the DJ booth
Strobe light flash
And you know the truth
Baby got game
She'll take your loot
Keys to the crib
With no dispute
See her dancing in her birthday suit

On a dare
I wanna see if she will share
The kinda toys she uses when I'm not there
None at all
She swears
I don't care
I make her buy another one
And a new dress to wear
Goes the toy against her curly hair
Now she must confess
How she really like to play
Or if she don't
I lower the speed
And bad words she'll say
Tell me how you play
How you play
Even in her anger
She's still
Supercute
Maybe it's cause
She comes from East L.A
But every time I see her body on display
I gotta call her name from the DJ booth
Strobe light flash
And you know the truth
Baby got game
She'll take your loot
Keys to the crib
With no dispute
See her dancing in her birthday suit
Supercute
When you see her dancing in her birthday suit

Shake it around
When you see her dancing in her birthday suit
Supercute
