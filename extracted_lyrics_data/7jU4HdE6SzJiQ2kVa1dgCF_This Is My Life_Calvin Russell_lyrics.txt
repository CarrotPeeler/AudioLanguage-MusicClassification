1 ContributorThis Is My Life LyricsThis is my life
And so I'm gonna live it
And any little thing I do
I won't beg you to forgive it
Don't let this bother you
Don't you worry about it
I ain't lookin for approval
I can do so well without it
I'll be sittin on
Your back porch
Singin out a tune just to you
This is my life
Don't you hold it against me
If I try to find some kind of life
That feels like it fits me
Don't let this bother you
Don't you worry about it
I ain't looking for approval
I can do so well without it
I'll be sittin on
Your back porch
Singin out a tune just to you
This is my life
And so I'm gonna live it
And any little thing I do
I won't beg you to forgive it
Don't let this bother you
Don't you worry about it
I ain't lookin for approval
I can do so well without it
I'll be sittin on
Your back porch
Singin out a tune just to youYou might also likeEmbed
