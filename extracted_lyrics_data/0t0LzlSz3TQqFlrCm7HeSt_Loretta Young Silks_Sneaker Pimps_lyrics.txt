Got answers for everyone, endless excuses
Not habit for anyone, â€˜cause I'm trying to break your click-track heart
Seen a vision of perfect grace, airbrushed and lifeless
All contempt and aftertaste, it's like I'm waiting for the scars to heal

You're so Loretta Young silks, fashioning your self escape
You're so Loretta Young silks, trading on your super waif
All style before content, using me as bait
You're so Loretta Young silks, swapping your love for hate

Soft focus for full appeal, pictured as flawless
No context for self esteem, I'd be pushed to give your love on that
As far as the eye can see: too much perfection
Pure substance for wannabes, keeps you beating to a click-track heart

You're so Loretta Young silks, fashioning your self escape
You're so Loretta Young silks, trading on your super waif
All style before content, using me as bait
You're so Loretta Young silks, swapping your love for hate

You might also like
You're so Loretta Young silks, fashioning your self escape
You're so Loretta Young silks, trading on your super waif
All style before content, using me as bait
You're so Loretta Young silks, swapping your love for hate

You're so Loretta Young silks, swapping your love for hate
(You're so Loretta Young silks,) swapping your love for hate
(You're so Loretta Young silks,) swapping your love for hate3Embed
