That's what you told me
No heaven above
That's what you told me then
You're long since gone
Your ghost lives on
In my record player
Everyday you perform for me
You revealed secret heart
Your innermost soul
And I would go to hell and back for you
I would do that
I idolized you
You were my hero
And everything I know
I learned from you
The Beatles
Brought me out of the darkness
And I could feel
I could feel real again
You revealed secret heart
Your innermost soul
And I would go to hell and back for you
I would do that
