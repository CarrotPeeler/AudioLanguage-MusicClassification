Hey, lil' mama
Why don't you come around?
You're feeling lost, you're feeling alone
You're feeling away far from your home
Hey, lil' mama
Why don't you come around?
You're feeling lost, you're feeling alone
You're feeling away far from your home

See what the world is giving
It's more than everything you need
Some don't know what true love is
Look around you and you will see, hey
Mothers are loving, sisters are sharing
You should forget all the things you don't need
You've got your soul, you've got your brain
See what you can do with your hands

Oh, oh, now you feel it
Time to feel good, about you
To take a good break
And oh, oh, now you feel it
Peace inside, your mind
Got to live

Hey, lil' mama
Why don't you come around?
You're feeling lost, you're feeling alone
You're feeling away far from your home
Hey, lil' mama
Why don't you come around?
You're feeling lost, you're feeling alone
You're feeling away far from your home

When the sun is going down
And there's silence in your head
Don't you worry, don't you run
There's a place to lay your head
Don't you know how to stand up and make this world your own
If you feel like giving up, I'll make you feel at home

Oh, oh, now you feel it
Time to feel good, about you
To take a good break
And oh, oh, now you feel it
Peace inside, your mind
Got to live
Hey, lil' mama
Why don't you come around?
You're feeling lost, you're feeling alone
You're feeling away far from your home
Hey, lil' mama
Why don't you come around?
You're feeling lost, you're feeling alone
You're feeling away far from your home3Embed
