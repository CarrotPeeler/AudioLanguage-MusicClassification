Open up your head, feel the shell shock
This is dangerous
I walk through mindfields, so watch your head rock
This is dangerous
Open up your head, feel the shell shock
This is dangerous
Open up your head, feel the shell shock
This is dangerous
I walk through mindfields, so watch your head rock
This is dangerous
Open up your head, feel the shell shock
This is dangerous
I walk through mindfields, so watch your head rock
So watch your head rock
This shock
This is dangerous
Open up your head, feel the shell shock
This is dangerous
Open up your head, feel the shell shock
This is dangerous
I walk through mindfields, so watch your head rock
This is dangerous
Open up your head, feel the shell shock
This is dangerous
I walk through mindfields, so watch your head rock
