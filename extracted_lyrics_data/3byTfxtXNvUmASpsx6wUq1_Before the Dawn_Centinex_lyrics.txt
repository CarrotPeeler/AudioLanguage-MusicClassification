1 ContributorBefore The Dawn Lyrics
And when the moon
Has turned to black
Darkened clouds beneath
The astral stars
As the winds fly through
With wings so dark
A deep storming sea
With griefull past
I touch the grief, feel the pain
Taste the sorrow, before the dawn
The seagull fly in circles
Over an open sea
A morning again has risen
With silver tears
At the shore of a dreadful baltic
I touch the stones as the water
Echoes your name
Here I stand all alone
Themendous pain freeze inside
The sun sets slowly
Cold and silent
One day we will be united as one
You might also likeI cry until dawn
My mind disappears into the dark
In a void where candles burn
Sleep forever, dream those dreamsEmbed
