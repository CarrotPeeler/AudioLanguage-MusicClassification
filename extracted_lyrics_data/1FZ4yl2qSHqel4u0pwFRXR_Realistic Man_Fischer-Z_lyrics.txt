1 ContributorRealistic Man LyricsWas the frst to love you
And I won't be the last man to try
Built a wall around you
Spoke a common language
Had a grudging respect for the truth
Told you all that worried me
Tell me. . . Tell me the way they pinned you down
Oh so naturally. . . I'm a realistic man
Was the first to love you
And I won't be the last man to try
Built a wall around you
When the party's over
And they're scraping the mess off the floor
We'll still be laughing at them then
Tell me. . . Tell me the way they pinned you down
Oh so natrually oh I'm a realistic manYou might also likeEmbed
