Blues with a feelin'
That's what I have today
Blues with a feelin'
That's what I have today
I've got to find my baby
If it takes all night and day

What a lonesome feelin'
When you're by yourself
What a lonesome feelin'
When you're by yourself
Yes the one that you're lovin'
Has gone off with someone else

Well you know I love you baby
Wonder the reason why
Gone and left me baby
Left me here to cry
Blues with a feelin'
That's what I have today
I've got to find my baby
If it takes all night and day
You might also like

What a lonesome feelin'
When you're by yourself
What a lonesome feelin'
When you're by yourself
Yes the one that you're lovin'
Has gone off with someone else

Well you know I love you baby
Wonder the reason why
Gone and left me baby
Left me here to cry
Blues with a feelin'
That's what I have today
I've got to find my baby
If it takes all night and dayEmbed
