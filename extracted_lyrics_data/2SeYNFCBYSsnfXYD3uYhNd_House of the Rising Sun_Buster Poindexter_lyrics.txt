1 ContributorHouse of the Rising Sun LyricsThere is a house in New Orleans
They call the Rising Sun
And it's been the ruin of many a poor boy
And God, I know I'm one
My mother was a tailor
She used to sew me new blue jeans
And my father was a gambling man
Down in New Orleans
Now the only thing a gambler needs
Is just his suitcase and a trunk
And the only time he is satisfied
Was when he was on a drunk
So mother, tell your children
Not to do what I have done
Spend your lives in sin and misery
In the House of the Rising Sun
I've got one foot on a platform
I've got one foot on a train
I'm goin' back to New Orleans
To wear that ball and chain
There is a house in New Orleans
They call the Rising Sun
And it's been the ruin of many a poor boy
And God, I know I'm one
And God, I know I'm oneYou might also likeEmbed
