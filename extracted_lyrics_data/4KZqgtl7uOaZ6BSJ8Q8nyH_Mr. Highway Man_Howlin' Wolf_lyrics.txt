5 ContributorsMr. Highway Man LyricsBe careful what you're drivin', man
That Cadillac may get away, you better be careful
There standin' the highway man, standin' parked on the road
There standin' there highway man, parked on the road
You better watch out for the red light, just before you go
Green light says go, red light says stop
Look-a-here boy, you better be on your watch
There's standin' a highway man, parked on the side of the road
You better be careful, 'bout how you drive on the road
Stop
I love the Cadillac, long wreckin' machine
I love a Cadillac, it's a long wreckin' machine
Me an my baby can ride it, everything is nice till then
(Yeah)
I'll make a cool hundred, I ain't got time to stop for gas
I'll make a cool hundred, I ain't got time to stop for gas
I'm gonna drive this automobile, just as long as the gas lasts
(Play it)
Lookit here, man, please check this oil
Lookit here, man, please check this oil
Just a long Cadillac, bound to try out your soilYou might also likeEmbed
