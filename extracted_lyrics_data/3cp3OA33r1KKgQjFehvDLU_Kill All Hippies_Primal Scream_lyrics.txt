8 ContributorsKill All Hippies Lyrics
Hello, this is Gorgeous
Anybody out there read me?
10-4, I read you
My handle's "Gorgeous", pretty vacant, eh?
Subvert normality
Fuck you
Punk is not sexual, it's just aggression
10-4, old buddies, destroy, kill all hippies
Anarchy, disco sucks
Subvert normality


You got the money, I got the soul
You got the money, I got the soul
You got the money, I got the soul
I can't be bought, I can't be owned
You got the money, I got the soul
You got the money, I got the soul
I can't be bought, I can't be owned
You got the money, I got the soul

See Primal Scream LiveGet tickets as low as $83You might also like
You got the money, you got the money
You got the money, I got the soul
I got the soul, I got the soul
I got the soul, I got the soul
