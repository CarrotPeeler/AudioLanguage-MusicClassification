1 ContributorEvolve LyricsEmpty fading life
The start of genocide
The wake of all depression
The way we live and die
Resisting every dream
We fight with our machines
Religion, no more god
Evolve and we will see
Seems you lost your way
In a world that you disguised
Cry for help turns day to night
In the end, you choose your hell
Finding all the answers
Try and walk the wire
No one knows the answers
So I will walk the wire
Running out of time
The light is out inside
Mechanical aggression
No one can survive
Seems you lost your way
In a world that you disguised
Cry for help turns day to night
In the end, you choose your hell
You might also likeSeems you lost your way
In a world that you disguised
Cry for help turns day to night
In the end, you choose your hell
Seems you lost your way
In a world that you disguised
Cry for help turns day to night
In the end, you choose your hellEmbed
