8 ContributorsSweet Tooth Lyrics
This is for them big girls, smalls girls, tall girls
And this is for them skinny girls, white girls, black girls
Don't matter the color or the nationality
I got a sweet tooth come and get with me

When I saw you at the club girl leaning and rocking with it
Ooo you made a nigga wanna giggle with it
Let me put in the back of the coupe and hit it
And now all I wanna do is babysit it
I've been fiending wanna kiss it
Hungry girl let me raid yo kitchen
Fix me a plate of that...
I'm not playing girl, I'm on a mission
Legs won't stop shaking once I do it (ah ah)
Tongue game tight girl let me do it (uh huh)
Tease you then please you girl
Open up let me in your world
Girl, I wanna be alone with you
I'm trying to see what that booty do
Baby first let me know what you gonna do about this sweet tooth

Got a sweet tooth for you girl
Baby I'm tempted to taste
I can't wait to drink your milk
Your looking like a big whole piece of cake
I'm all up in your middle
Oooh it taste like Skittles
I'm just keeping it real with you
Girl, I got a sweet tooth
You might also like
Now I got you on my bed
Clothes off
Lying next to me
Girl I'm 'bout to give myself a cavity
Plus I'm gonna need band aids for my knees
Girl set the table and let me feast
Strawberry shortcake with whipped cream
I can taste it
My mouth is watering for you
Come here girl let me show you
Hop in the Range, slide through
All up in yo' crib, toss you
When it's over, I want more of you
So open up, let me spoil you
Girl I wanna be alone with you
I'm trying to see what that booty do
Baby first let me know what you gonna do about this sweet tooth

Got a sweet tooth for you girl
Baby I'm tempted to taste
I can't wait to drink your milk
Your looking like a big whole piece of cake
I'm all up in your middle
Oooh it taste like Skittles
I'm just keeping it real with you
Girl, I got a sweet tooth
(I don't want no dinner babe)
I'm going straight for dessert
(You don't need no panties babe)
Girl up under that t-shirt
Look it taste so good to me
And, I can't get enough
See, doc say stay away from sweets, fuck it
I'm gonna get my sugar up

Got a sweet tooth for you girl
Baby I'm tempted to taste
I can't wait to drink your milk
Your looking like a big whole piece of cake
I'm all up in your middle
Oooh it taste like Skittles
I'm just keeping it real with you
Girl, I got a sweet tooth
Got a sweet tooth for you girl
Baby I'm tempted to taste
I can't wait to drink your milk
Your looking like a big whole piece of cake
I'm all up in your middle
Oooh it taste like Skittles
I'm just keeping it real with you
Girl, I got a sweet tooth
Got a sweet tooth for you girl
Baby I'm tempted to taste
I can't wait to drink your milk1Embed
