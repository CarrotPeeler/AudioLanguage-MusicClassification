2 ContributorsA Very Good Life LyricsWhen I was like you
I might have had less thoughts about murdering myself
But when I see you I'm so happy that I went
You sit there as a company of rundown longhaired
Your smell, your clothes, your brand new fingernails
And I hear you whispering about me
But I will avoid your eyes
Avoid your eyes
Because I know I am the world's ugliest lady
I used to have less worries of life
Worries of life
Worries of life
Worries of life
But when I see you I'm so happy that I went
I never dressed like you
I don't know what it is this feeling of belonging
I ran away from school
Haven't we had such a great time together
No I won't reply to any of your emails
I won't
I won't
I never, I've just lost interest
And I still hear you whispering about me
You might also likeBut I will avoid your eyes
Avoid your eyes
Because I know you all just hate me
And now I have a very good life
A very good life
A very good life
A very good life
But people like you don't need to be in it1Embed
