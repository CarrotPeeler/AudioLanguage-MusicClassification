2 ContributorsWho Do You Love (Flyin’ Shoes) Lyrics
I walk 47 miles of barbed wire
I use a cobra snake for a necktie
I got a brand new house on the roadside
Made out of rattlesnake hide
Well I got a chimney made on top
Made out of human skull
Come on take a l'il walk with me, Arlene
Tell me, who do you love?

Who do you love?
Who do you love?
Who do you love?
Who do you love?

And a tombstone set in a graveyard's mind
Just 31 and I don't mind dying

Who do you love?
Who do you love?
Who do you love, Arlene?
Who do you love?

Ah the night was black and the sky was blue
Down the alley an ice wagon flew
Door bumped open and somebody screamed
You should have heard just what I seen

Who do you love?
Who do you love?
Who do you love?
Who do you love?


Well I ride a line, use a rattlesnake whip
Take it easy baby, don't you give me no lip

Who do you love?
Who do you love?
Who do you love?
Who do you love?

Well Arlene took me by my hand
Said "Alright Daddy, I understand"
Who do you love?
Who do you love?
Who do you love?
Who do you love?


I walk 47 miles of barbed wire
I use a cobra snake for a necktie
Ah I got a me a house on the roadside
Made out of rattlesnake hide
Well I got a chimney made on top
Made out of human skull
Come on take a l'il walk with me, Arlene
Tell me, who do you love?

Who do you love?
Who do you love?
Who do you love?
Who do you love?Embed
