4 ContributorsI Feel Like Breaking Up Somebodyâ€™s Home Lyrics(Break it up...Don't break it up)
Lying around home alone
On a rainy night like this
Starving for your love
Hungry for just one kiss
Every raindrop I hear
Against my window pane
Beats so loud and clear
Words that spells your name
Got nowhere to turn
Tired of being alone
Feel like breaking up somebody's home
I know it's useless hanging on
When you belong to someone else
I can't change my feelings
'cause after all I didn't make myself
Tonight I cried so hard
I believe I caught a chill
Can't control the vibrations
My heart just won't stand still
You might also likeGot nowhere to turn
Tired of being alone
Feel like breaking up somebody's home
(Don't break it up. Don't break it up)
Got nowhere to turn
Tired of being alone
Feel like breaking up somebody's homeEmbed
