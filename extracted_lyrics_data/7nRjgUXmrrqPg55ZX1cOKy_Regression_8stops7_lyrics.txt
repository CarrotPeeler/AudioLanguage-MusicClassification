2 ContributorsRegression LyricsWhat if i tried, would you then
Consider my time as well spent
Would you put me on trial, consider who's fit
To brand me insane, so I won't ever have to deal with it
What have I done, your only son
They spit on my name, and now I have a gun
Running 'round in circles, kids come out to play
But I can't remember what it was that made me
Feel this hate
All my pictures on display here
What's that you said, you were my friend
I can't recall, say it again
This isn't a game, but I will pretend
Look at me now, 'cause I win
I would be faking, I didn't know
These idle hands don't know their worth
I've covered them in blood
But this still fucking hurts
Hate
