10 ContributorsIn Your Room Lyrics
I always try
To keep my eyes from closing besides
I still see you
It seems so right
To think of the time we could have tonight
And it's so cold
It seems my hands are colder than yours
Warm me up inside
Your face turns red and so does mine

And we climb all around
You stare into my eyes
And watch me drown inside
You whisper to me softly as I lie

You shine so bright
A light inside my head
I love the thought
Of staring at you
Asleep at night
Kaleidoscopic thoughts of me and you
And you're just so cool
For me to see
The life we'd have and we'd tell everyone
Your face turns red and so does mine
You might also like
And we climb all around
You stare into my eyes
And watch me drown inside
You whisper to me softly as I lie

I always try
To keep my eyes from closing besides
I still see you
Asleep at night
Kaleidoscopic thoughts of me and you
And so you'll join my way of life

And we climb all around
You stare into my eyes
And watch me drown inside
You whisper to me softly as I lie
And we climb all around
You stare into my eyes
And watch me drown inside
You whisper to me softly as I lie4Embed
