1 ContributorIf Thatâ€™s Alright LyricsI could wind you up like a ten-cent doll, point you right into the nearest wall
You call my name, I'm gonna walk right by, this ain't no time for you to question why
And in all this time, I could get this far, a beat-up soul and a borrowed car
Gonna place my bets on something real, close my eyes and just spin the wheel
If that's all right with you, there's a one-way ticket in my shoulder pack, gonna climb right on, man
And not look back, and all those sins that'll drag you down, gonna leave 'em all in the next big town
And when I get off, I'm gonna take it slow, lose myself in the afterglow
Gonna right my debts, face my fears, later on, I might disappear, if that's all right with you
If it's all right, I might stand naked on a cliff so high you can't look down
And if it's all right, I might just make it what goes around, I'm gonna get around, get around
I'm gonna get around
Had a crazy dream, me in the water, like a submarine going down
And I'm calling out for somebody's daughter, the ocean swallows up the sound
And when I wake up and I breathe the air, hear the voices in the city square
I can watch the time go right past, gotta find a way that I can make it last
If that's all right with you, if that's all right with youYou might also likeEmbed
