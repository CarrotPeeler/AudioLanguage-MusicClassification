3 ContributorsJungle Music, Pt. 2 Lyrics
I didn't rely on these fools
I picked up a brick and then I stepped foot in the trap
Book me an AirBnb, I step in the place
I turn studios into traps
I'm with her for the night (night)
This bitch is bluffin' if she thinks that
She can just enter my life, it comes with the price
I'm sitting down gettin' face, half way across he map (oh-oh)
Mummy I'm makin' it big, mummy I'm makin' these racks (oh-oh)
I had to give out a box like azumah to make it now you know
Immigrant child never had it so easy-ah, now you know

Kwasiasɛm (sɛm)
What are you sayin' (sayin)
40 on me okay (Pow)
It's okay (okay)
I do what mummy says (says)
Told her it'll be okay (okay)
You should just go and pray (pray)
Everythin' is going okay (okay)
I'm not the one to go play

I dey the jungle with lions
They'll eat you if you no go fit hold your own in the trap
I dey the jungle with lions
I'm Simba, I watch out for people 'cos plenty be Scar
She fell in love with the kid
Otwa sɛ Madonna menhyɛ shirt ohu me Tupac
She fell in love with the kid (yo, fuck that shit, come on)
Spendin’ more times all alone
Can we go back to the norm?
Everything no dey feel right
If it is wrong it's wrong
Shawty se wa cutti me off
Please don't dance to my songs
Ɛtɔ da ɔyaa ɔyɛ me nice, ebi nso aa na ɔyɛ me long
Tryin' and tryin', forget perfect timin'
This thing for work out, the boy no get choice
Mama I grind, I will be home when I'm shinin'
My eyes on the prize, I dey block out the noise
Show make I see, if you tell me you love me
I want loyalty, no bro give we shit
Live from the gutter to top of the list
Journey to greatness, I never go trip

What are you sayin' (sayin)
40 on me okay (Pow)
It's okay (okay)
I do what mummy says (says)
Told her it'll be okay (okay)
You should just go and pray (pray)
Everythin' is going okay (okay)
I'm not the one to go play

Them no dey play with kid
People go do anythin’ for attention
Money for call me today
I'm always on target oo i no get misses
We still dey trap till the sun up
They're waitin' for manna deɛ woho bɛ teetee
We no dey mingle with yawa
Them know we from Tema and we no dey listen
