7 ContributorsThe Last Chance Texaco Lyrics
A long stretch of headlights
Bends into I-9
They tiptoe into truck stops
And sleepy diesel eyes
Volcanoes rumble in the taxi
Glow in the dark
Camels in the driver's seat
A slow, easy mark

But you ran out of gas
Down the road a piece
And then the battery went dead
And now the cable won't reach...

It's your last chance
To check under the hood
Your last chance
She ain't soundin' too good
Your last chance
To trust the man with the star
'Cause you've found the last chance Texaco
The last chance

Well, he tried to be Standard
He tried to be Mobil
He tried living in a World
And in a Shell
There was this block-busted blonde
He loved herâ€”free parts and labor
But she broke down and died
She threw all the rods that he gave her

Ah, but this one ain't fuel-injected
Her plug is disconnected
She gets scared and she stalls
She just needs a man, that's all

It's her last chance
Her timing's all wrong
Her last chance
She can't idle this long
Her last chance
Turn her over and go
Pullin' out of the last chance Texaco
The last chanceEmbed
