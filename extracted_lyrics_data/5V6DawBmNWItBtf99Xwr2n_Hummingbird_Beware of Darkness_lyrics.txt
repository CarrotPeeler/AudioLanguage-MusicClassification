That’s how I know your spirit’s alive
But as I approach you, you fly away
I’m not a big mean blackbird like you say
Take me down
To where I've been
I will fly into the night
We will find our love again
Outside my window a little hummingbird cries
The sky turns dark, the raindrops fly
I call out to you and hear my voice echo back in return
In search of truth I quickly find concern
Take me down
To where I've been
I will fly into the night
We will find our love again
Outside my window a little hummingbird dies
I hold your body the tears drop from my eyes
Where could you be oh where could you be my love?
I’m growing up so lonely each and every day
Take me down
To where I've been
I will fly into the night
We will find our love again

You’re breaking my heartEmbed
