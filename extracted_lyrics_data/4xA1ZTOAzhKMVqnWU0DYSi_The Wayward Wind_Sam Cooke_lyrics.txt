4 ContributorsThe Wayward Wind LyricsO, the wayward wind is a restless wind
Is a restless wind that yearns to wander
And I was born the next of kin
The next of kin to the wayward wind
In a lonely shack by a railroad track
I spent my younger days
And I guess the sound of the outward bound
Made me a slave to my wandering ways
And the wayward wind is a restless wind
Is a restless wind that yearns to wander
And I was born the next of kin
The next of kin to the wayward wind
Oh I met her there in a border town
We vowed we'd never part
Though I tried my best to settle down
Now she's alone with the broken heart
And the wayward wind is a restless wind
Is a restless wind that yearns to wander
And I was born the next of kin
The next of kin to the wayward windYou might also likeEmbed
