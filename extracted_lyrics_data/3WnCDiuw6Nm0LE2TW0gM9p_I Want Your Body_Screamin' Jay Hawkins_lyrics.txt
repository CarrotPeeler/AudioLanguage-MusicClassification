I want your body bad
I want your body
I want your body real bad
I want your body baby
Bad enough drive me mad
Wanna feel yo fingers
Places they ain't ever felt before
Wanna feel yo fingers
Places they ain't ever felt before
I want you to upset me baby
Love me right through the front door

Wanna feel your honey
Flowing across my thigh
I wanna feel your honey
Flowing across my thigh
I want you to love me, baby
Oh-ow
You made me real high{?}You might also likeEmbed
