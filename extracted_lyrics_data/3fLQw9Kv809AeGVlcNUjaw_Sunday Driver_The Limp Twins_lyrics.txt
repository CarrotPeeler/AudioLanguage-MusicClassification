1 ContributorSunday Driver Lyrics
I see sunlight creeping in
Through a hole in the wall
I get a funny feeling
I should go outside
I can't stand to be
Cooped up indoors
Gonna get my car
Come around to yours

And maybe
I'll take baby
For a ride

It's been some time
Since I've been shut out
On the road
With the blue skies in front of me
I can let the past turn me round
Let's get ourself lost
In the midsummer haze
Down the cool country lanes
That meander for days
You might also like
And maybe
I'll take baby
For a ride

And maybe
I'll take baby
For a ride

Love is electrified
Current creates motion

And maybe
I'll take baby
For a ride

Glamour of countryside
Roads like the ocean

And maybe
I'll take baby
For a rideEmbed
