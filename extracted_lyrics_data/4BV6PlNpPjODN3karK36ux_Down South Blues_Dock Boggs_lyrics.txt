1 ContributorDown South Blues LyricsI'm a-going to the station
Gonna catch the fastest train back home
I'm a-going back South
Where the weather suits my clothes
A love like water
It turned off and on
When you think you've got 'em
Oh, they all turned off and gone
I was raised in the country
Where the snow it never fell
I'm a-going back South
If I don't do so well
I'm a-going back south
If I wear out ninety-nine pair of shoes
'Cause I'm broken-hearted
I've got those down South blues
Oh, my daddy told me
And my mama told me, too
Don't you go off, honey
Let the men make a fool out of youYou might also likeEmbed
