2 ContributorsBeing Everyone (Single Version) LyricsWho am I at night when my eyes are closed tight?
Who am I, and where; when eyes see far beyond?
Every border, every dream?
Every hidden memory?
Every nightmare, truth or dare, who do I see now?
Look at me!
Tell me what you see
Are we? Just being everyone?
Where am I; tell me what should go, what should stay
Where am I? Where am I? And where shall I go tonight?
Every night a different theme
Every time you're in a different dream
Am I me there?
What am I?
Who will I be now?
Look at me!
Tell me what you see
Are we? Just being everyone?
Look at me!
Tell me what you see
Are we? Just being everyone?
I cry, I fall
I love, I hate
I know many, though no face ever stays
I breathe, I fly
I kill, I die
Though there's nothing that I know
No one can recall where I have been or who I was

Tell me what you see
Are we? Just being everyone?
Look at me!
Tell me what you see
Are we? Just being everyone?
Look at me!
Tell me what you see
It's me! Being everyone!Embed
