2 ContributorsTo the Bitter End LyricsLooking back at the days that past, as hindsight's perspectives settle in
And unwinds the time....
It dawns on me, that for which my life is sold
It dawns on me that only one could have done that
For which my life was stolen from within my reach
You took away my life and
Like shattered glass cuts through the skin
I began to feel your vengeance
And your treachery
The blood is real...
Yet silent i remained
Indicted by the conspiracy
Of fate......
Entombed within
The walls of the condemned
Conspiracy of fate
Fate will may you pay!
Why should I
Pay the price for your mistakes?
For trangressions
Not remotely mine
Loyalty of blood
Condemns me with your sins
Paying with my life
Silent I remain
Empty walls cry out my name

(solo: Seghers)
Burn, ignited by my will
Slowly consumed from within
Amongst the damned
You will descend
You should be the one paying the price
(repeat)
Entrapped by my own ethics
My own rules impose this torture
Shall I speak and save myself?
The traitors do not deserve respect!
Why should I pay the price for your mistakes?
Blood ties and loyalty should work both ways
Shall I speak out?
Let the truth be known?
Why do I condemn myself to this prision
Without walls?
Why?
I should make you pay!
I shall betray!
Burn, ignited by my will
Slowly consumed from within
Amongst the damned
You will descend
You should be the one paying the priceEmbed
