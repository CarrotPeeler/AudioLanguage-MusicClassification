8 ContributorsThe Globe LyricsBreak it on down
Bless you
(Whoo)
Bless you
(Whoo)
Oh, bless you
(Whoo)
Bless you
Where are you going, my beautiful friend?
Is this the road that we take 'til the end?
And if we break down, are we left behind?
Is this the highway of all mankind?
Axis spins, so round and round we go
Where we're goin' no one really knows
Here we, here we, here we, here we go
Feel the fire way down below
Come on and dim the lights (It's party time)
Switch on the strobe (Do what you like)
We're gonna have a ball tonight (Let's have a ball)
Down at the Globe
(Time to look at the rain)
Come on dim the lights (Here we, here we, here we go again)
Switch on the strobe (Lock it right, yo, yo, bring the pain)
We're gonna have a ball tonight (All I see is acid rain)
Down at the Globe

It's 1 am, let's go out to a rave
One more in before we hit that grave
It's hotter than a microwave, wave
Come on and dim the lights (It's party time)
Switch on the strobe (Do what you like)
We're gonna have a ball tonight (Let's have a ball)
Down at The Globe (Lift it on up, lift it on up)
Come on and dim the lights (It's party time)
Switch on the strobe (Do what you like)
We're gonna have a ball tonight (Let's have a ball)
Down at The Globe
"Well, I am the Bishop of Brixton
On me way to the garden party in the palace"
"Where's the party, officer?"
Come on and dim the lights (It's party time)
Switch on the strobe (Do what you like)
We're gonna have a ball tonight (Let's have a ball)
Down at The Globe (Here we go one time, break it on down)
Where is the fair, dear? Not in this land
But still, you try to get what you can
You know that it's bad, but if you insist
Here's one more chance, now, that you just missed
Come on and dim the lights (It's party time)
Switch on the strobe (Do what you like)
We're gonna have a ball tonight (Let's have a ball)
Down at The Globe (I believe you, I believe you)
Come on and dim the lights (It's party time)
Switch on the strobe (Do what you like)
We're gonna have a ball tonight (Let's have a ball)
Down at The Globe
Awaking up the global warming way
Napalm cornflakes for my Special K
What's the health department got to say?
Don't smoke more than fifty fags a day
So have you ever asked yourself

Come on and dim the lights (It's party time)
Switch on the strobe (Do what you like)
We're gonna have a ball tonight (Let's have a ball)
Down at The Globe (Come on, party on down)
Come on and dim the lights (Let's have a ball)
Switch on the strobe (L-, l-, let's have a ball)
We're gonna have a ball tonight (Let's have a ball)
Down at the Globe (Come on)Embed
