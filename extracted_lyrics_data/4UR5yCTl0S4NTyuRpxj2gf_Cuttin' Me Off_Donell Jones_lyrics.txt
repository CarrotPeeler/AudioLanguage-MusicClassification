2 ContributorsCuttinâ€™ Me Off Lyrics
Oh yeah, woo
Let me talk to you, girl

Said I didn't lie, told you where I'd be
I'd be chillin' with my boys at the (Won't you let me finish)
How your girl gon' tell you she saw me with some trick
But ain't told you she been trying to get with (Girl, let me finish)
I've been trying to tell you for a while
But you never let me get what I'm trying to say out, ooh
I always listen to what you got to say
But for a change, won't you shut up, let me explain

(I will tell you) I will tell you exactly where I was but you
Keep cut, cuttin' me off
(Baby, I will tell you) I will tell you exactly who I was with but you
Keep cut, cuttin' me off
I could just lie, I got a solid alibi
Wasn't no late night thong show at my spot last night
('Cause without you) 'Cause without you, girl, I'm lost I would say
But you keep cut, cut, cuttin' me, cut, cuttin' me off

Gave you your turn, you done said a mouth-full
Now I'm gon' speak my mind and you gon' let me finish
Girl, I promise that I'll tell you the truth, the whole truth
Let me finish, let me finish, let me finish
I've been trying to tell you for a while
But you never let me get what I'm trying to say out
I always listen to what you got to say
But for a change, won't you shut up, let me explain
You might also like
(I will tell you) I will tell you exactly where I was but you
Keep cut, cuttin' me off
(Baby, I will tell you) I will tell you exactly who I was with but you
Keep cut, cuttin' me off
I could just lie, I got a solid alibi
Wasn't no late night thong show at my spot last night
('Cause without you) 'Cause without you girl I'm lost I would say
But you keep cut, cut, cuttin' me, cut, cuttin' me off

Girl, there ain't gon' be no fights (No more)
I don't want to raise my voice (That's for sure)
It don't need to go this way (So baby just STOP)
And listen to me when I say

(I will tell you) I will tell you exactly where I was but you
Keep cut cuttin' me off
(Baby, I will tell you) I will tell you exactly who I was with but you
Cut cuttin' me off
I could just lie, I got a solid alibi
Wasn't no late night thong show at my spot last night
('Cause without you) 'Cause without you girl I'm lost I would say
But you keep cut, cut, cuttin' me, cut, cuttin' me off
Cuttin' me, cuttin' me, keep cuttin' me off
You keep cuttin' me, cuttin' me, keep cuttin' me off
And you never pay attention
Damn, you don't listen
Shut up, girl, 'cause you know I love you, girl
Cuttin' me, cuttin' me, keep cuttin' me off
You keep cuttin' me, cuttin' me, keep cuttin' me off
And you never pay attention
Damn, you don't listen
Shut up, girl, 'cause you know I love you, girlEmbed
