Ain't no need for an introduction!
This is a Mykael V cinematic experience!
But y'all already know what I'm saying, right? (J-J-Jouce Money)
God always!

Thank God I ain't listened to y'all, I knew I was Heaven-sent
Had the blackish, pew-pew-pew-pew, like Barack was President
Pull up to the house, I know all the people
Bad black shawties in my games like I'm Oladipo

I just stepped back on the ooze like I'm Oladipo
Legal army stick, she think I'm a prick
Oceanside shawties, she show where she work at Abercrombie
She keep tryna miss Balenciaga with that Abercrombie Fitch
Mad Max, got some rockets in my backpack
'Member when the net was havin' issues up in my class
Gotta mumble on every song because I'm abstract
And I gotta mumble in my crib, I gotta stack cash, yee

The last on your dial, but first in your heart, and that's the truth!

Thank God I ain't listened to y'all, I knew I was Heaven-sent
Had the blackish, pew-pew-pew-pew, like Barack was President
Pull up to the house, I know all the people
Bad black shawties in my games like I'm Oladipo (Ayy, ayy, ayy)
You might also like
Yeah, look, baby tryna stack that
Junk in the trunk so I call her my lil' hatchback
Ayy, come here, show me where your Tes' at
She got dues, tryna drop some money in her CashApp
Last night, we was goin' up in a hurry, in a fo-fo
Lookin' like a Brett Favre jersey like, "Damn, son"
Peekin' out the whip, hella handsome
Lightskin Barbie throwin' Jimmy Choo stamp strong (J-J-Jouce Money)
Yeah, talkin' hella fish
We wasn't supposed to be here, how do you explain this?
Yeah, all thanks to the God's son
Somewhere in the left field, I think I just caught one

Thank God I ain't listened to y'all, I knew I was Heaven-sent
Had the blackish, pew-pew-pew-pew, like Barack was President
Pull up to the house, I know all the people
Bad black shawties in my gamess like I'm OladipoEmbed
