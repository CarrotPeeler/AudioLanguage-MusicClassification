Can you handle it?
Can you handle it?
'Cause you ain't had nothin' like it
Can you handle it?
Can you handle it?
'Cause you ain't had nothin' like it
Can you handle it?
Can you handle it?
'Cause you ain't had nothin' like it
Can you handle it?
Can you handle it?
'Cause you ain't had nothin' like it

Boy, just to feel my touch
If you're not prepared, it might be too much
Now you don't have to take my word
'Cause actions speak louder than words (Louder than words)
And I will be heard

Can you handle it?
Can you handle it?
'Cause you ain't had nothin' like it
Can you handle it?
Can you handle it?
'Cause you ain't had nothin' like it
Can you handle it? (Can you handle it?)
Can you handle it? (Can you handle it?)
'Cause you ain't had nothin' like it
Can you handle it? (Can you handle it?)
Can you handle it? (Can you handle it?)
'Cause you ain't had nothin' like it
You might also like
When it comes to love, I'm the best
Do you really think you can pass my test?
Now here, your story's not too high
Don't feel like you're lettin' me down (Lettin' me down)
'Cause all you can do is die

Can you handle it?
Can you handle it?
'Cause you ain't had nothin' like it
Can you handle it?
Can you handle it?
'Cause you ain't had nothin' like it
Can you handle it? (Can you handle it?)
Can you handle it? (Can you handle it?)
'Cause you ain't had nothin' like it
Can you handle it? (Can you handle it?)
Can you handle it? (Baby)
'Cause you ain't had nothin' like it


Can you handle it?
Can you handle it?
'Cause you ain't had nothin' like it
Can you handle it? (Can you handle it?)
Can you handle it? (Baby)
'Cause you ain't had nothin' like it
Can you handle it? (Can you handle it?)
Can you handle it? (Ain't nothin' like it)
'Cause you ain't had nothin' like it
Can you handle it? (Just to feel my touch)
Can you handle it? (Just might be too much for you, baby)
'Cause you ain't had nothin' like it

(Can you handle it?)
(Ain't nothin' like it)
Ain't nothin' like it
(Can you handle it?)
(Ain't nothin' like it)
Ain't nothin' like it
Just to feel my touch (Can you handle it?)
Just might be too much for you, baby (Ain't nothin' like it)
For you, baby
(Can you handle it?)
(Ain't nothin' like it)
Can you haâ€” (Can you handle it?)
(Ain't nothin' like it)Embed
