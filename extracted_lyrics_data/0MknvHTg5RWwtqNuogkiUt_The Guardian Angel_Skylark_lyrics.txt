1 ContributorThe Guardian Angel Lyrics(The Divine Oracle:)
In front of the dark church of Heaven we are
Searching for the truth...
(White Warrior:)
My mind is blind, I'm going insane...
I can't pronounce even the Holy Name
(The Guardian Angel:)
Don't push your brain, Don't waste your time
And I will show you the Sacred Sign
(White Warrior:)
But I, among the Mankind I cry
Throwing my bad dreams
From my mind away
Until my weapons are ready to stay
Along the Lucifer's Lane
(White Warrior:)
My strength has gone, my road is dark, the
Final battle
Is going to start
(The Guardian Angel:)
The fire burns, the Angels pray, the Eternal
Flame rise and shine again
You might also like(The Guardian Angel:)
'cause I, among the Mankind I cry
Pushing your bad
Dreams from your mind away
Until my faith will
Protect our game
To join the warm of the Flame
(The Guardian Angel:)
'cause I'm the Guardian Angel
So lost to take control...
(White Warrior:)
The sound of time is watching you and now I
Really come:
My Guardian Angel
(The Guardian Angel:)
'cause I'm the Guardian Angel
I'm lost to take control...
My only mission is to save
The world, so I'm ready to give my soul!Embed
