2 ContributorsRaw Revolution LyricsIt started with the music thing
Not lovin' what the people sing
Just doing our own damn thing
And the scene said
Hold up, you seven ain't right
Ain't feeding the peoples melodic appetites
But it's all we know
Took it down to the U.S. highways
Through the swamps of the U.S. byways
Just screaming "Hell, we're gonna do it our own way."
And the government said
Hold up, you seven ain't right
Can't lock you down or tax you right
But it's all we know
And it's said that youth's ,well only tragedy
Is being unoriginal
So, you can call it a raw revolution
So, go ahead and call it a raw revolution
So, you can call it a raw revolution
So, go ahead and call it a raw revolution
Well I remember when Steve took a gulp of that poor kid's blood in Germany
Same tour I passed out in a Vegas Carl's Jr
How 'bout when I sparred with that big old pimp on the roof top in Switzerland
Or when I busted my head open that fun New York summer night
And that nice girl said
You might also likeHold up, you ain't right
Let me clean you up, you boys are a mangled sight
But it's all we know
And we're going
Hold up, we ain't right
Just hang together play music all night
'Cause it's all we know
And it's said that youth's ,well only tragedy
Is being unoriginal
So, you can call it a raw revolution
So, go ahead and call it a raw revolution
So, you can call it a raw revolution
Yeah, go ahead and call it a raw revolution
So, you can call it a raw revolution
Yeah, go ahead and call it a raw revolution
So, you can call it a raw revolution
Yeah, go ahead and call it a raw revolution
Cause it's all we know
Yeah it's all we know
See it's all we know
Yes it's all we knowEmbed
