2 ContributorsAngel Lady (Come Just in Time) Lyrics(Angel Lady come just in time
Chased that devil from my broken mind
Got back my soul from the lost and found
Kicked that trip that had me chained and bound
Angel Lady come just in time)
She came on like a summer breeze
And oh she talked ooh she teased me
Right up to her door and then
Then she popped it to me
Won't you come on in
I wanna hold you I wanna squeeze you
I will get down on my knees
And do anything you want me to
And just then I turned to my devil and said
I say you.. you and I are through
Angel Lady come just in time
Chased that devil from my broken mind
Got back my soul from the lost and found
Kicked that trip that had me chained and bound
The devil said we've travelled too long
And anyone who's ever seen has seen me
You know you can't trust no woman
And I think this ones teasing
But boy you've got it coming
But I'll keep her around
Cos you're pulling me down
And when she looks at me that special way
I forget about yesterday
And then the devil grabbed ahold of me
And he let me know that it ain't gonna be that easy

Chased that devil from my broken mind
Got back my soul from the lost and found
Kicked that trip that had me chained and bound
And then she cocked her head to the side
A question rose up in her eyes
And it said why are we both here all alone
Can I help you can I carry that stone
Her skin was so fine as I touched
And from just an inch away
I couldn't help but say
That I knew what she saw
And I knew what she knew
And I turned to my devil and swore we were through
Angel Lady come just in time
Chased that devil from my broken mind
Got back my soul from the lost and found
Kicked that trip that had me chained and boundEmbed
