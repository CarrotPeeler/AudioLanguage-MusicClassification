4 ContributorsDelay Lyrics
See no one can predict the weather
Friendships get lost
See a legend might live forever
But what does it cost?
First you're here and there and then you're gone
You know that it's your right to be wrong

What happened to the things I wanted?
I wonder every day
What do I do if every place is haunted
With the ghost of my mistakes?
And all I do is on delay?
This what I'm thinkin' about (x8)

What happened to the things I wanted?
It's a lost cause
See, a legend might live forever without livin' at all
First you're here and there and then you're gone
You know that it's your right to be wrong

What happened to the things I wanted?
