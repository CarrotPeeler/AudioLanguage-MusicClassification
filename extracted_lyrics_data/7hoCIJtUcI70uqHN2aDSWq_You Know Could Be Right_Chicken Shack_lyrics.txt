Dang look at shawty how she work that pole
I ain’t even know that she could twerk that low
She’s get my vote, if if her names on the poll, when she work my pole, when she take my soul
God I love these strippers (I do)
Dollars, got a weeks worth (For sure!)
In my house I need her
Hoping we can make the bed “eeh err”
Man this bih got some beautiful titties
Gotta be the fricking queen if the titty committee
These other biddies ittty bitty I ain’t here to be picky
I just wanna bang bang, I don’t need all the chitty
Ooh whee
Somebody see that booty
Whoo me, do me, use me (ooh whee!)
Hold up white girl? Hm, Whooty
Really I’mma use her then I’m on to the next
Women only good for one thing and that’s sex
Know this is the strip club, but I call it chicken shack cuz I get birds, legs, thighs and breasts
Pop that molly in a private scene
Her name Molly ain’t that irony
Wait that’s a new face I just peeped
Hear the new girl just turned 18

Girl I’m boutta make this money!
You might also likeSee me, I’m about to make these dollars, easy (I am)
Boutta make these bastards run their pockets, sleazy (Gimme)
This the kind of ish that you won’t see on, TV (Nuh uh)
Touch you, tease you, if you want to pay then, squeeze me (Pay it, pay it)
That’s how my baby boy got them YEEZYs for real (you know it is)
Like to think I struck the lotto and I made quite the deal (That’s it)
High on ecstacy and molly, bih I love how it feels (That’s it)
With the action that I give back stage im used to some pills (I am)
No one ever showed a better path in life
She don’t think about her life at 45
When she needs a new career when they recognize
Her face from vids that they seen online
She been on cam busting moves, sending nudes, letting dudes amuse their views
And the papers cool
But what do you do if your kids confused getting questions about you coming back from school?

Mom, how come you don’t have any clothes on the internet?
I ain’t ever really even think about how it’s gotta be on the other side
Never had a different point of view of what the life could be, but now I’m thinking I should try
Maybe if I did, I could be different, might be the right time for me to make a change inside
Like what if that was my mama or my daughter, I’mma chill, nah I’m lying!
I don’t give a hell about these chicks, man
Baby momma got all of the kids, fam
I be pimping that’s just who I is, and
Back to business, i got plans for six Xans
She gon’ pop it, lock it, let it go
Leave her clothes and inhibitions on the floor
She’s just an object, she a ho, I just want to pop a thotty body after every show
I just need me some cheeks
High on life, skip the weed
This the lifestyle for me
But she belongs to the streets
See the sob story was very good
No effect on me though you think it should
At the end of it I’m still living hood
All she gotta do is show me sumn good!
Show me sumn, show me sumn
Show me sumn good
Show me sumn, show me, won’t you
Show me sumn good
Back it up, ay, then show me sumn good
Drop it down baby, then show me sumn goodEmbed
