1 ContributorRegeneration LyricsSecrets sleep for a million years
Now awakened by man
Once pretending but now I find
No one's safe from his hand
Create life from the clutches of death
Energy fills the air
Heartbeat on the blade of a knife
No innocents will be spared
Regeneration, metal soul has been brought back to life
Regeneration, metal soul has been brought back to life
The forsaken, revered by all
Ruler of sea and land
Never bending or near the ending
Born beneath desert sand
Create life from the clutches of death
Energy fills the air
Heartbeat on the blade of a knife
No innocents will be spared
Regeneration, metal soul has been brought back to life
Regeneration, metal soul has been brought back to life

Secrets sleep for a million years
Now awakened by man
Once pretending but now I find
No one's safe from his hand
Create life from the clutches of death
Energy fills the air
Heartbeat on the blade of a knife
No innocents will be spared
Regeneration, metal soul has been brought back to life
Regeneration, metal soul has been brought back to life
Regeneration, metal soul has been brought back to life
Regeneration, metal soul has been brought back to life
Back to life
Back to life
Regeneration
Regeneration, metal soul has been brought back to lifeEmbed
