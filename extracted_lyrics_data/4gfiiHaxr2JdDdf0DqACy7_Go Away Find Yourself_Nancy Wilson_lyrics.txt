19 ContributorsMarco (Script) LyricsINT. ARNO’S BAR - CHICAGO
A bottle cap rests on top of a beer bottle with a dollar bill in between the bottle and cap. A college-aged kid tries to pull the bill out without knocking the cap over and fails.
KID 2: Jesus.
KID 1: It can’t be done.
MARCO: You sure about that?
KID 2: There’s a trick, huh?
Cut to Marco drinking his beer.
KID 2 (O.S.): Don’t put any money on it, it’s just a trick.
KID 1 (O.S.): I’m telling you, it can’t be done!
MARCO: So you give up?
KID 2: Yeah, alright.
He places the cap on top of the dollar bill for Marco. Marco walks over, chops downward in one swift motion, removing the $20 bill and leaving the cap right on top of the bottle neck.
KID 2: What?!
KID 1: No way. Show me that again.
MARCO: Sure. You got another $20?
KID 2: Screw this.
They get up and leave.
MARCO: Don’t go away, man! Hey guys, wanna buy a Rolex?
SAUL (O.S.): Whoa, whoa, hold on! How much for that cheap piece of crap?
Saul storms into the bar.
BERTA: Look what the wind blew in!
SAUL: Hey, Berta.
MARCO: Holy crap. Jimmy, my man, I said you would beat the rap! Hey Berta, set him up, would you?
SAUL: It’s alright, I’m good.
MARCO (to Berta): No go on, he don’t mean it. (to Saul) You just got out of jail, you’re not gonna have a drink? That’ll be the day.
SAUL: Marco, settle down. I’m in a rush. My brother’s outside in a taxi, the meter’s running.
MARCO: Wait, Chuck’s outside? Tell him to pull that broomstick out of his ass and get in here, I’m buying.
SAUL: No, no, no, we got no time, I gotta catch a plane. I came here to say goodbye. I’m moving to Albuquerque, New Mexico.
MARCO: Mexico? You skipped bail?
SAUL: New Mexico. Ya know, like Bugs Bunny and the Road Runner.
MARCO: Yeah, what are you gonna do there?
SAUL: I’m gonna work for his law firm, like in the mail room. It’s a start anyways.
MARCO: Now you’re talking crazy. You just got out of jail, now you wanna go back? Because working for him, that’s all that is.
SAUL: Marco. I was done, you understand? I didn’t beat the rap. Chuck flew in and saved my ass. It’s time to make some changes.
MARCO: Listen to me, you’re Slippin’ Jimmy. What do you gotta change, huh?
SAUL: Everything! It’s time to grow up.
MARCO: Yeah, according to who, Chuck?
SAUL: Same goes for you, man! You wanna spend the rest of your life on that stool? I mean come on, Marco, look at yourself.
A car horn beeps outside the bar.
SAUL: That’s him. I gotta hit it.
MARCO: His master 's voice.
SAUL: Really?
MARCO: Listen, go outside, tell Chuckles you got some business you forgot.
SAUL: Marco!
MARCO: Come on! You gotta have one last blowout! Do the watching thing again, maybe we’ll pull that tar money scam you were talking about. Go out, get some girls…
SAUL: I made a promise.
MARCO: So you made a promise, but it was, what do you call it, under duress. He got you out of jail, okay, but he’s your brother! I mean what else is he gonna do?
SAUL: Marco, listen to me, alright, Chuck’s not making me do this. He’s giving me an opportunity and I’m grabbing it.
Saul walks towards the door.
MARCO: It’s like watching Miles Davis give up the trumpet!
SAUL: What? What does that even mean?
MARCO: It’ s just a waste is all I’m saying.
SAUL: Look, I’m gonna fly out there, I’m gonna get settled, and I’ll call you.
MARCO: Alright Jimmy.
Saul walks out the door.
MARCO (upset): Hey, have a safe flight, alright?
TITLE SEQUENCE
INT. HAMLIN-HAMLIN-MCGILL LOBBY
Saul is waiting on a bench under the stairs. Kim sees him, walks down the stairs, and sits down next to him.
KIM: Hey.
SAUL: Hey.
KIM: What’s up?
SAUL: Just waiting to talk to Howard.
KIM: Can I ask about what?
SAUL: I’m taking your advice, I’m giving the case to HHM.
KIM: Why?
SAUL: The fact that Chuck doesn’t want me here has something to do with it.
KIM: I’m so sorry.
SAUL: Why didn’t you just tell me?
KIM: I just… I didn’t want you hating your own brother.
INT. HOWARD’S OFFICE
HOWARD: How’d you find out? Did Kim tell you?
SAUL: I figured it out on my own. About time, right? I brought the Sandpiper stuff with me, it’s down in my car. I figured your guys could do the outreach. If any of these geezers don’t want to sign with you just give me their names. I’ll talk them into it.
HOWARD: You know, Jimmy, I never wanted it to go this way. If it had been up to me, we would have at least…
SAUL: Howard. I get it.
HOWARD: Your brother’s very important to the firm.
SAUL: Sorry I called you a pig fucker.
HOWARD: Well… We owe you some money, don’t we? The of-counsel fee? I think we discussed $20,000.
Howard hands Saul a check.
HOWARD: That and whatever the common proceed funds of Sandpiper ultimately add up to, you’ll receive 20% of that. It should be a very nice pay-day for you. When it comes.
SAUL: Yup. I got something for you too.
Saul goes into his jacket and pulls out a piece of paper, then hands it to Howard.
SAUL: It’s a shopping list for Chuck. I mean he’s doing better, but he still needs deliveries every day. I think he’d be more comfortable with someone else doing it.
HOWARD: I see.
SAUL: You don’t need to do it personally, it just needs to get done.
Howard sits down.
SAUL: It’s pretty straightforward. The ice is a pain in the ass, but he needs it. I usually sneak into a hotel and fill a garbage bag, but you can have whoever you hire just buy it. The most important thing is the newspapers. The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, they’re a must. There’s a newsstand on Eubank that has both of them. It opens at 6AM, which is good because he’s an early riser. The Albuquerque Journal he gets delivered, but someone still has to bring it in for him.
HOWARD: You’ve been doing all of this everyday? (in awe) For over a year.
SAUL: You’ll take care of this?
HOWARD: Absolutely. I’ll get it done, and done right.
Saul gives a small nod, then stands up.
HOWARD: I always liked you, Jimmy. Remember? I used to call you Charlie Hustle.
SAUL: Yeah, I remember that.
EXT. ELEVATOR
Jimmy and Kim walk out of the elevator, past the dented trash can.
EXT. PARKING GARAGE
SAUL: I’m sorry I yelled at you.
Kim hugs him.
SAUL: That was nice.
KIM: You’re sure you’re alright? It’s not a crime to let it out.
SAUL: There’s nothing to let out. Chuck’s a sick man.
KIM: That’s no excuse.
SAUL: He’s my brother, and he thinks I’m a scumbag. There’s nothing I can do to change that. What else is there to say?
KIM: Wow, that’s mature.
SAUL: Dalai Lama’s got nothing on me.
INT. NURSING HOME
Bingo balls rattle around. Saul pulls one out.
SAUL: O-64! As in “Oh! To be 64 again!” O-64!
Cut to nursing home residents marking off their bingo boards.
SAUL: Next up we got.. (pulls out a ball) N-32! N as in Nancy. Reagan. First lady with a lot of style. Anyone else seen Hellcats of the Navy?
Cut to bingo players.
SAUL: No winners yet? OK, here’s the next one. B-2! Just like the B2 bomber. Stealth! Probably would have taken off from Kirtland by now. We would never know, because it’s stealthy! Still no winners? No?
Cut to nursing home employee rolling her eyes.
SAUL: Here we have B-4, another B! How about that as in… before too long, we’re gonna have another winner. No? Nobody? OK. Alright. And here comes… hey, it’s our old friend B! B-12.
Cut to the balls bouncing around in the bingo machine.
SAUL: B as in, uh… B as in… betrayal. Benedict Arnold betrayed the United States. Still no winners? No? OK. Here it is. (grabs another Bingo ball) Oh, what are the odds! That’s four B’s in a row. That’s… B-7. B as in… B as in… brother. Brother. B-7. 7 brides for 7 brothers. I’m sure a lot of you have brothers. Not like mine, though. Any winners yet? Take another look, okay? I’ll wait. If it’s another B, we could have a real problem here.
Cut around the bingo room, the players are starting to glare at Saul.
SAUL: And… hey, it’s another B! (grimaces) B-5 as in… boy, this B thing is really starting to tick me off. B as in battleship, B as in Bourbon. B as in Belize! Beautiful place, so I’ve heard. I would love to go there, but, uh, let’s face it, that’s never gonna happen. None of us is ever leaving this godforsaken wasteland.
Cut to bingo players looking hurt and a little disgusted.
SAUL: Sorry. Scratch that. Moving on?
Saul grabs another Bingo ball.
SAUL: I mean what is it with this place, it’s like living inside of an Eazy-Bake oven. I mean look out that window, it’s like a soulless Georgia O’Keefe hellscape out there. Crawling with squirrels, snakes, scorpions, and… Ever seen the movie The Hills Have Eyes? It’s a documentary! God forbid your car breaks down, you have to walk 10 steps, you have melanoma the size of a pineapple where your head used to be.
Cut around the bingo room.
SAUL: You ask why? Why do I live here? Why?
OLD MAN: Excuse me? Are you gonna read that number?
SAUL: Yeah! I’m gonna read your number! (looks at the ball) It’s another B! It’s another frigging B! Of course! Why not? WHY NOT! And the next number…
Saul stares at the bingo ball.
SAUL: Quick question, who here knows what a Chicago sunroof is?
Saul leaves the stage and starts walking towards the bingo players.
SAUL: Anybody? You sir? No? Well back home, there was this guy named Chet. Chet was a real asshole. He might have owed me some money, he might have slept with my wife before she became my ex-wife. The details don’t matter. Suffice to say I was wronged.
Alright, so one summer evening, I was out having a few drinks. Or two, maybe three. You get the picture. And, uh, who do I see? Chet! He drove up and he double-parked outside of Dairy Queen. He went in to get some soft-serve. Now Chet drove, and just to give you an idea of what kind of a douchebag he was, Chet drove a white ‘97 pearlescent BMW series. With white leather interior. So I saw that thing, and I’d had a few like I said. And, uh, I climbed up top, and I may have, uh… defecated through the sunroof. Not my finest hour, I’ll grant you that. But that’s what a Chicago sunroof is, now you know! It’s a real thing, I didn’t make it up, I’m not the first person to do it, there’s a name for it. Guy wanted some soft serve? I gave him some soft serve. I did not know that his children were in the back seat. There was a level of tint on the windows that I’ll maintain to this day was not legal in an Illinois-licensed vehicle. But somehow that’s on me, I guess. Who leaves two Cub Scouts in a double-parked car with the engine running? Come on! Well Chet was connected, you see, like, uh, Cicero connected. So usually I’d be looking at malicious mischief, public intoxication, disorderly conduct, maybe. But he’s got the DA saying indecent exposure. Calling me a sex offender, what?! One little Chicago sunroof and suddenly I’m Charles Manson?! And that’s where it all went off the rails! I’ve been paying for it ever since. THAT’S WHY I’M HERE! I don’t...
Saul looks a the bingo ball he’s been holding. He tosses it to the old man that asked if he was going to read it earlier.
SAUL: You know what? Any of this stuff you want, come get it. Kitty-cat notebooks for everybody!
Saul drops his mic and walks out of the room.
EXT. ARNO’S BAR - CHICAGO
Saul gets out of a taxi, takes a look at the car parked out front, then walks into the bar.
INT. ARNO’S BAR - CHICAGO
Saul sees Marco slumped in a barstool and walks up to the bar.
BARTENDER: What can I get you?
SAUL: Old Style. Make it two. What happened to Merta?
BARTENDER: Merta? She’s doing alright. She’s my step-mom. She don’t come in much anymore.
He hands Saul the two beers.
SAUL: Tell her Slippin’ Jimmy says hello.
BARTENDER: Slippin’ Jimmy?
SAUL: She’ll know.
BARTENDER: OK. That’ll be $5.50.
Saul pays him then takes the beers over to Marco. He takes a stirrer and starts rubbing Marco’s ear.
SAUL: Marco… You gorgeous hunk of a man… How long will you keep me waiting?
He pokes Marco in the back of the head.
SAUL: Wake up you fat son-of-a-bitch. I bought you a beer.
Marco wakes up.
MARCO: Jimmy?
SAUL: In the flesh.
They hug.
INT. ARNO’S BAR - LATER
SAUL: So I’m not dark enough for you, huh?
MARCO: Well I’m just saying I don’t see any color. I mean, 10 years in the desert, you should look like Anthony Quinn in Lawrence of Arabia. “The Turks pay me a golden treasure…”
SAUL: “...yet I am poor…”
MARCO: “...because I am…
BOTH: “...a river to my people!”
Both laugh.
SAUL: Hey, I’m Irish, ok? I spend my time staying out of the sun.
MARCO: Speaking of pale sons of bitches, how’s your brother doing?
SAUL: Chuck’s fine.
MARCO: Still working for him?
SAUL: Sometimes. What about you? I mean besides falling asleep on a bar at 4 o’clock on a Wednesday afternoon.
Marco turns around to show Saul the back of his shirt.
SAUL (reading): “Lake Michigan Standpipe”? What’s that?
MARCO: My brother-in-law owns the company.
SAUL: Hold it, you got married?
MARCO: No no no no, my sister Angie’s husband.
SAUL: So what the hell’s a Standpipe?
MARCO: Standpipe. You know what a standpipe is.
SAUL: I don’t think so.
MARCO: Fire department comes. They stick one end of the hose in the hydrant, the other end goes on the standpipe. The water goes out the standpipe, through the sprinklers, and douses the flames. It’s important stuff!
SAUL: So. That’s what a standpipe is, huh?
MARCO: That’s a dry standpipe, there’s also the wet standpipe.
SAUL: What’s the difference?
MARCO: I don’t know if I can explain it totally.
Marco coughs and then pounds his chest as if he’s congested.
MARCO: How’s your mom?
SAUL: She passed away about three years ago.
MARCO: That’s too bad. She was a great lady.
SAUL: Yeah.
MARCO: From Wisconsin, right?
SAUL: Yeah.
MARCO: Funeral out there?
SAUL: No it was here.
MARCO: Here?
SAUL: Yeah, well we were only in town for a few days.
MARCO: You were in town and you didn’t look me up?
SAUL: Chuck was in the middle of a big case. We couldn’t stay around, so…
The bartender walks to their table.
BARTENDER: Can I get you guys anything else?
SAUL: I’m good. You want anything?
MARCO: Nah.
He gives them their bill and Saul pays it.
BARTENDER: Thank you. (walks away)
Saul takes out a Kennedy half-dollar.
SAUL: How’s my Cutlass running?
MARCO: It’s been around.
SAUL: Well, it’s a classic. A little body work, paint job, it could really be something.
MARCO: So what you gonna do when you’re here?
SAUL: I dunno. See the sights. Catch a Cubbies game. Bleachers. Get a hot dog at Henry’s.
A businessman walks into the bar, talking on his phone. Saul starts to look at his Kennedy half-dollar.
SAUL: Is he a regular?
MARCO: No.
SAUL (whispering): You’re buying, I’m selling.
He holds up the Kennedy half-dollar. Marco nods and smiles
MARCO: Alright then.
INT. ARNO’S BAR - LATER
SAUL: All I ask is that you take a look.
MARCO: I’m sorry buddy, it’s just, I’m not interested.
SAUL: C’mon man. What’s it gonna hurt to take a look? It’ll take 2 seconds.
MARCO: Alright, show me what you got.
Saul shows Marco the half-dollar.
SAUL: Boom.
MARCO: OK?
SAUL: Can you see it?
MARCO: I see a Kennedy half-dollar.
Cut to reveal the businessman in the background.
SAUL: Which way is he facing?
MARCO: JFK is facing left.
SAUL: Exactly.
MARCO: Which way is he supposed to be facing?
SAUL: Right. He’s supposed to be facing right.
MARCO: OK, so why is this one facing left?
SAUL: November 22, 1963, Kennedy is assassinated, alright? The whole nation goes into mourning. They start naming everything in sight after him. And the Mint wants in on the action. So in ‘64 they decide to change the Lincoln half-dollar to the Kennedy half-dollar. When they design it they put Kennedy facing right, facing east, just like the way they had Lincoln. You know why?
Marco shakes his head no.
SAUL: East symbolizes the dawn. It’s why pretty much every grave everywhere faces east. So the spirit of the dead person faces the rising sun. Dead things, burial things.
The businessman starts listening in.
SAUL: But there’s one technician for the Denver mint, alright, and this guy he believed in the New Frontier. Camelot, the whole deal. That fascination just destroyed him. When he sees that coin with Kennedy facing east, facing the American past, it pissed him off. So he went rogue, without telling anybody, he flipped things around so that Kennedy was facing west, towards the New Frontier. Towards the future.
Close-up of the Kennedy half-dollar.
SAUL: Now, the Mint struck about 3,000 of these before they figured it out and canned the guy. About 1,000 made it out into general circulation, they managed to get most of them back. But, there’s still 200+ floating around out there.
The businessman laughs.
SAUL: What’s that? I didn’t catch that.
BUSINESSMAN: I didn’t say anything.
SAUL: You mind, buddy? I’m having a private conversation here. (to Marco) this one’s not in perfect condition, but, in the open market I’d say it’s worth $600 or $800 bucks.
MARCO: $800?
SAUL: Yeah, but I’m hard up so I’ll take $100 for it.
MARCO: You want me to give you $100 for a half-dollar?
SAUL: I want you to give me $100 for an $800 coin.
MARCO: I don’t know.
SAUL: I’m gonna go drain the snake, think about it.
Saul gets up and goes to the bathroom.
MARCO (to businessman): This guy’s playing me, right?
BUSINESSMAN: Definitely.
MARCO: That slick son of a bitch! You know what, I know this guy on Walbash, coins dealer, friend of my uncle’s. (to bartender) Hey Joey, can I use your phone, I’m making a call?
JOEY: Keep it short.
MARCO (to businessman): I’m gonna call this guy, and when he tells me it’s a scam you know what I’m gonna do? I’m gonna call the cops to get this scumbag thrown in the can. You’re my witness, OK?
Marco pretends to dial.
MARCO (over phone): Hey! How ya doing? Yeah it’s Alvin, Dane Tanner’s nephew. Yeah. Yeah, that’s right. I’m gonna sound like a wack job, but I’m in a bar, and I got this guy telling this cock and bull story about this 50-cent piece he’s trying to sell. He says Kennedy’s supposed to be facing West or something…
The operator starts talking so Marco turns his back to the businessman.
MARCO (over phone): Yeah. Yeah, that’s what he said, Denver. Jesus, no kidding. Well I gotta go. Thank you. I owe you one. (to bartender) Thanks Joe.
BUSINESSMAN: So what he say?
MARCO: Yeah, you know, he didn’t really know much.
Marco sees Saul coming back from the bathroom and approaches him.
MARCO: I’ll see you $50 for it.
SAUL: $50? I’m taking a bath at $100.
MARCO: Alright, look, I got $64 right here.
SAUL: It’s an $800 coin, I’m not gonna sell it to you for $64.
MARCO: If you wait for me, I’ll give you $100.
The businessman whistles at Saul.
BUSINESSMAN: Look, buddy, I got $75 right here.
SAUL: Sorry, I need $100.
MARCO: Listen slick, nobody’s talking to ya, mind your own business ok?
The businessman walks over to them.
BUSINESSMAN: Cash money, $80.
MARCO: If you give me a chance, I’ll be back with $100.
SAUL: How long will that be?
MARCO: I don’t know. I gotta catch a train, come back. An hour, hour-and-a-half?
BUSINESSMAN: This guy was ready to call the cops on you.
SAUL: What?
MARCO: I was not!
SAUL: Why would you do that?
MARCO: Now this guy is making shit up!
BUSINESSMAN: I got $110 right here.
SAUL: Sold.
Saul exchanges the coin for the cash.
MARCO: No no no no.
SAUL: This guy’s got the cash.
MARCO: Don’t do that!
SAUL: Take care of that, that’s history right there.
MARCO: You can’t do that!
BUSINESSMAN: Money talks, you lost, it’s over.
MARCO: No it’s not over, that’s crap! Where do you think you’re going?
BUSINESSMAN: Back off, dude.
MARCO: I’ll back off when you give me the JFK back. Hey Joey, call the cops, this guy just tried to rip me off.
BUSINESSMAN: This guy’s a liar, I did not rip anybody off.
He walks out the door.
MARCO: You come back in here and your ass is grass, I got friends, buddy! You hear me? I got friends!
Saul walks over. They wait til he’s gone. Then they start laughing.
SAUL: You are so beautiful!
Saul kisses him on the head.
MARCO: Hey, everybody! Next round’s on us!
MONTAGE
INT. MARCO’S HOUSE - BEDROOM - MORNING
GIRL 1: Hey! You are not Kevin Costner!
SAUL: I was last night.
GIRL 1: Jesus! Asshole. I mean seriously! (gets dressed) Lucy Ann! He’s not Kevin Costner.
LUCY: You sure he’s not?
GIRL 1: Yes, Lucy, I am sure!
LUCY: He said he was gonna give me his card!
GIRL 1: Does this look like a manager’s place?
SAUL: Can I interest you ladies in some mimosas? At least stick around long enough to get dressed.
GIRL 1: Screw you.
SAUL: If you build it, I will come.
GIRL 1: Lucy, come on!
They both walk up the stairs out of Marco’s house.
LUCY: Bye.
SAUL: The door sticks.
They fumble with the door then leave. Saul gets dressed and checks his messages. He has 15 new messages from his clients. Marco comes downstairs.
MARCO: So what’s it gonna be today, pal? I’m up for anything and everything.
SAUL: Marco, I’m sorry, I gotta go back.
SAUL: It’s been great, and I appreciate your hospitality, but a week’s gonna have to do it. I gotta go home.
MARCO: I already called in sick. Come on man, this is home. You hate it out there, what do you got to go back to?
SAUL: My clients.
MARCO (scoffing): Clients? What are you like a Gigolo or something?
SAUL: Uh, Marco… I’m a lawyer.
MARCO: What?
SAUL: Honest to God, I do elder law, which is like wills and estates…
MARCO: So you’re ripping off old people?
SAUL: No, I’m not ripping off old people, I’m not ripping off anybody.
MARCO: Holy crap, Slippin’ Jimmy’s a lawyer? No wonder you wanna go back, I mean you gotta be king of the desert, right? Riding around in a white Caddy making bank?
SAUL: I’m not making bank. I’m making a living, more or less.
MARCO: Living? All due respect, you’re a lawyer. If you’re not making bank you’re doing it wrong.
SAUL: I’m building something. It takes time.
MARCO: If you’re gonna build something, build it out here. I mean, lawyers in Chicago make plenty, I assure you.
SAUL: I don’t know what to tell you, Marco. Chuck’s in Albuquerque.
MARCO: All due respect, Chuck’s a stuck-up douche bag. I hate to break it to you, but he doesn’t even like you.
SAUL: He’s my brother.
MARCO: OK. I get it. Family. You gotta go back, but, remember this?
Marco picks up a fake Rolex.
SAUL: The Rolex thing. Whatever happened to the guy who used to sell us these?
MARCO: Jim Kane? He got deported. This is the last one. I say we go for it.
SAUL: No.
MARCO: Come on. Last time we did, what $600? We’re on a hot streak, baby, we can break a grand, easy.
SAUL: I can lend you some cash.
MARCO: I don’t need the money, Jimmy. I need this. Come on, you say you’re happy doing wills or whatever? Good for you man, seriously. I gotta tell you that standpipes ain’t cutting it for me man. I got nothing, Jimmy. Give me this.
SAUL: I can’t do it.
MARCO: Come on. Give me this.
SAUL: Marco…
MARCO: Give me this.
SAUL: Listen to me…
MARCO: I’m listening. Come on, just one last time.
SAUL: Hey, listen to me…
MARCO: I’m listening…
EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT
Marco coughs. He hears howling off-screen.
SAUL (O.S.): It’s gotta come from the gut. (howls) Just like a wolf, go ahead.
The man with him howls.
SAUL: No, deeper, deeper.
He tries again.
SAUL: Yeah, you do that right at the moment of, you know, pure joy, and it will escalate it ten times. It’s something… it’s prehistoric.
MAN: Hey… hey look.
He picks up Marco’s wallet.
MAN: $50… $200… $400…
SAUL: Whose is it?
MAN: I don’t know. He’s got like a thousand bucks in here! Somebody must have… Oh… Oh damn.
They see Marco lying in the alley.
SAUL: Is he… Is he, uh…
MAN: I don’t know.
Saul starts poking him with a piece of wood.
SAUL: Hey buddy, you with us?
MAN: Look, the guy’s just had too many. I say we move on. Wanna split this?
SAUL: Marco, you ok?
MAN: Marco? What, you know this guy?
SAUL: Call 911. CALL 911!
Saul starts slapping Marco’s face. The man runs away with the wallet.
SAUL: Hey! (dials 911) I need an ambulance, my friend’s having a heart attack. We’re in an alley, southeast of Lasalle and Shermer. I don’t know, he was like this when I found him.
Marco opens his eyes.
SAUL: Marco, Marco, you with me?
MARCO: I screwed it up.
SAUL: You did good buddy, just hold on, alright. They’re on their way, they’ll be here in a minute.
MARCO: Jimmy, you know what?
SAUL: Save your breath, you’re gonna be fine.
MARCO: This was the greatest week of my life.
He starts to fade out. Saul slaps his face.
SAUL: Hey! Hey hey hey! Hang in there! Hey! Wake up man! Come on! Marco! Buddy!
Saul tries to start his heart.
SAUL: Help! Anybody? Marco…
EXT. CHURCH - DAY
Saul exits the church.
MAN: Hey Jimmy.
SAUL: Hey bud. Can I bum one?
He hands Saul a cigarette. Saul lights it and takes a drag.
MAN (gestures at Saul’s ring): Is that his?
SAUL: Yeah. His mom gave it to me.
MAN: Thought it looked familiar.
SAUL: I figured I’d wear it today, but I don’t know, I’m not a big ring guy.
MAN: Could be worth a couple of bucks.
They smoke their cigarettes in silence. The man stomps his out.
MAN: Better head back. I’ll see you inside.
He walks back inside. Saul’s phone rings.
SAUL (over phone): Hey.
KIM: Is this Ferris Bueller?
SAUL: Speaking.
KIM: I don’t want to interrupt your big day off. Just checking in, what are you up to?
SAUL: You know, burning down the place.
KIM: I wouldn’t expect anything less. So, whatever it was, did you get it out of your system?
SAUL: Yup, all gone.
KIM: Good. I wanna run something by you. The Sandpiper case? It’s getting too big for HHM. Howard’s decided to partner with another firm. David & Maine, you heard of them?
SAUL: Sure, up in Santa Fe.
KIM: Right. Well, they’ve heard of you too. And they’re interested. They want to make you an offer contingent on an interview. They’ve got a partner track position in mind.
SAUL: Wait, what? A partner track? What are you talking about?
KIM: I’m talking about there’s an office in Santa Fe with your name on it. Or there could be. And you’d be working on your case.
SAUL: I don’t even, uh… Chuck wouldn’t like it.
KIM: Chuck has no say in this. You wouldn’t be working for HHM, and Chuck has no say in who Davis & Maine hires.
SAUL: Why me? Is this like a tax write-off? Charity thing? What’s the angle?
KIM: Jimmy. We’ve been talking with your clients, the Sandpiper residents, and they ask about you every chance they get. I don’t know what it is, but you have a way with them.
SAUL: Old people love me.
KIM: So, sounds good?
SAUL: Kim. I can’t imagine what you did to make this happen. Thank you.
KIM: I didn’t do anything. Much. And believe it or not, Howard’s been pushing this, too.
SAUL: Good old Howard.
KIM: Listen, we’re gonna be down at Judge Murray’s court on Thursday, at 11. The Davis & Maine people will be there. It’d be the perfect chance for you to meet them.
SAUL: Thursday at 11. Alright, I’ll be there. Thanks, Kim. Really.
KIM: I’ll see you then.
Kim hangs up her phone.
INT. CHUCK’S HOUSE
CHUCK: All the originals need to be copied and filed. See that written right here on the box? “Copy and file”, that’s as big and clear as possible.
ERNESTO: Got it, Mr. McGill. Anything else?
CHUCK: Well on the grocery front, almost everything was right this time.
ERNESTO: Great.
CHUCK: Almost. It’s a small thing, but to my taste the Granny smith apples are a bit too tart.
ERNESTO: Those are the green ones, right?
CHUCK: Right. I prefer the red ones, but not red delicious. Those are generally tasteless. Fujis should be in season. It’s not a major issue, but…
ERNESTO: Fuji apples. OK.
CHUCK: Oh, and I’d like to try soy milk, so maybe a half gallon of that.
ERNESTO: You got it.
CHUCK: Well thank you, Ernesto. I appreciate your attention to detail. Do you need to write any of this down? Because it’s okay if you do. Just to be sure.
Ernesto takes notes into a note pad.
CHUCK: So Fuji apples.
EXT. CHUCK’S HOUSE
Ernesto is loading up his car. He sees Saul parked down the street and walks over to him.
SAUL: Hey, Ernie!
ERNESTO: Hey! How you doing, man?
SAUL: Good, good. So Howard’s got you looking after Chuck, huh?
ERNESTO: Yeah. It’s a few extra bucks, you know?
SAUL: How’s he doing.
ERNESTO: Seems okay. Like usual. I’d say we could grab a beer but they’re waiting for all that paperwork back at the office. You know how it is.
SAUL: Don’t I, though.
ERNESTO: See ya Jimmy.
SAUL: See you around, Ernie.
INT. CHUCK’S HOUSE
Chuck peeks through his window and sees Saul parked across the street from his house.
EXT. TOLL BOOTH
MIKE (over phone): Done business with him before? Alright. Yeah. I’ll be there.
Saul pulls into the parking lot.
SAUL: Davis & Maine, McGill. It’s nice to meet you, gentlemen.
He stops short of the court room and rubs the back of his ring before pulling back out of the parking lot.
MIKE: Well that was quick. No charge.
SAUL: Help me out, here. Did I dream it, or did I have $1,600,000 on my desk, in cash. I close my eyes and I can still see it. It’s burned into my retinas like I was staring into the sun. No one on God’s green earth knew we had it, and we could have split it 50/50. We could have gone home with $800,000 each! Tax free!
MIKE: Your point being?
SAUL: Why didn’t we? What stopped us?
MIKE: I remember you saying something about doing the right thing.
SAUL: I don’t even know what that means.
MIKE: You wanna know why I didn’t take that money? Is that what you’re asking?
SAUL: Yeah, that’s what I’m asking.
MIKE: Me personally, I was hired to do a job. I did it, that’s as far as it goes.
SAUL: Yeah. Well I know what stopped me. And you know what? It’s never stopping me again.
Saul pulls out of the parking lot and starts humming “Smoke on the Water”
