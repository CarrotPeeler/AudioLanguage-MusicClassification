If I ain't got nothing, I got you
If I ain't got something, I don't give a damn
'Cause I got it with you
I don't know much about algebra
But I know one plus one equals two
And it's me and you
That's all we'll have when the world is through

'Cause baby, we ain't got nothing without love
Darling, you got enough for the both of us
So come on, baby

Make love to me when my days look low
Pull me in close and don't let me go
Make love to me, so when the world's at war
Let our love heal us all, right now, baby
Make love to me, me, me, me, me, oh, oh
Make love to me

Hey, I don't know much about guns
But I, I've been shot by you, hey
And I don't know when I'm gon' die
But I hope that I'm gon' die by you, hey
And I don't know much about fightin'
But I, I know I will fight for you, hey
And just when I ball up my fist, I realize
That I'm layin' right next to you
You might also like
Baby, we ain't got nothing but love
And darling, you got enough for the both of us
Ooh

Make love to me when my days look low
Pull me in close and don't let me go
Make love to me, so when the world's at war
Let our love heal us all, help me let down my guard
Make love to me, me, me, me, me, oh, oh
Make love to me, me, me, me, me
