And it's T for Texas, T for Tennessee
T for Thelma
That woman made a fool out of me
Yodelahee, yodelahee, yodelahee
I'm'a goin wheere that water
Tastes like Robitussin
I'm'a goin where the water
Tastes like cherry wine
Well that ol' Georgia water
Tastes like turpentine
Yodelahee, yodeladee, yodeladee
I wanna send you a letter
Baby through that US Mail
I wanna send you a letter
Baby through that US Mail
I'll say, 'Hello, Sweet Pea
Yo daddy can not fail.'
Yodelahee, yodeladee, yodeladee
Aw, if you don't want me mama
You sure don't have to stall
If you don't want me mama
You sure don't have to stall
'Cause I can get more women
Than a passenger train can haul

I'd rather drink muddy vino
And sleep in a hollow log
I'd rather drink muddy vino
And sleep in a hollow log
Than to be down in Houston
Treated like a dirty dog
Yodelahee, yodeladee, yodeladee
Well it's T for Texas, T for Tennesee
And it's T for Texas, T for Tennessee
T for Thelma
That woman made a fool out of me
Yodelahee, yodeladee, yodeladeeEmbed
