Who saw those dark eyes?
These years gone by
Deep within
Burn my skin
All those years gone by
In the heat of the night
All those years gone by
Who felt those cold hands?
Who felt those cold hands?
Touch my skin
Deep within
Burn my soul
Fell to the ground where I was found
All those years ago
All those years ago
All those years ago
Everybody makes mistakes
Everybody makes mistakes
Even me
Just be free
This is a place where in the end
It happens in our world within
