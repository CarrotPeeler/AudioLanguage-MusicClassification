3 ContributorsAll Over Me LyricsI don't wanna go out tonight
Wanna turn down the light
Wanna light that fire
So we can take it higher
I don't wanna go clubin'
I wanna make some lovin'
So honey come on over here
And give me some of what I want
I don't need no money, no uptown time
I just need you to put your hands all over me tonight
I don't need no money, no uptown time
I just need you to put your hands all over me tonight
Baby, you know all I need
Is a little good company
You fit that bill
So let me take that pill
I love the way you slide
The way you take your time
You turn me up real slow
Until I'm ready to explode
I don't need no money, no uptown time
I just need you to put your hands all over me tonight
I don't need no money, no uptown time
I just need you to put your hands all over me tonightYou might also likeEmbed
