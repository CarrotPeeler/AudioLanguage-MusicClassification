2 ContributorsAutopilot LyricsI grip the wheel
But it won’t turn for me
And I set the pace
But I lost track of the speed
Now I’m calling for help on every frequency
S.O.S
The Captain fled
If you can hear me please help me out
I’m drifting, away
A distance is growing
And the signals lost it seems
It’s too late to go back
On my own now
Carry me
I need someone to take me over
Someone to come and take control now
And I’ll be lost in the sea till I find it
Get my ship to the shore autopilot
As I lose track of the course
I can’t help but think
Was this vessel meant to sink?
Now I’m certain that this is an emergency

The lights are out
I can’t determine
What’s north or south
As I battle the waves
Wave after wave after waveEmbed
