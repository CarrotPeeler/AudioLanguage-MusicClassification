3 ContributorsWorld of Vibrations Lyrics
We'd like to welcome you all again to the world of vibrations
Introduction to the nation, a revolutionary thought
Hear the sound evolve, expand, and changin'
Most of the things that we're sayin' haven't broken through your chatter
So y'all niggas still ego trip based and
Have not begun to taste the kundalini wisdom bliss
I'm droppin' as a lyric quotin' vessel for the sages
Play this on your playlist
I like dough
But musically I'm transcendin' the physical
And don't blame me for the slang and the word
God writes these rhymes through me
I just listen to him
I'm just livin', dude
Matrix driven rules haven't fooled me
Cuz I still think abstract
And stay metaphysical
And challenge what is really real
And keep creatin' with the force to bring rap back
Not that it's away
But everybody got somethin' to say
So let me speak the opposite of what's hot now
And make that hot
So it will get exploited
And the corporations only owe back dudes who bite my style
And they can try and try again
I've even been influenced by a lot of pioneers
South to the East and West
But when a hot MC
Gets on stage with a real MC
Most of the time the situation gets hostile
You might also like
We vibrate at higher frequencies
Welcome to our world and intro to
Fall into a space
Where there is no thoughts
Just moments captured
Here we go
We vibrate at higher frequencies
Let us up inside of your head
Just step inside our world of vibrations
Bump this from your birth to your deathbed

Take time with the pad and the pen to dig within
In a world full of BS that we're livin' in
To my ears music sounds sweet as cinnamon
So I stay poundin' out tunes again and again
It's the 5th chapter, ladies and gentlemen
And I still got MCs on my dinner menu
Write late at night this isn't David Letterman though
On second thought, I'm like a letter man so
Let the craft evolve catch a little syndrome
Shootin' through your veins, vibratin' though your eardrums
Used to think 30 years old then the end comes
Now I feel like I'm just gainin' momentum
Seen the world two times all except India
About to vacay there when we finish this one
Work hard but still some sleep
We won't mention them
In fact, they act as fuel for our engine
Engine engine number 9, mic lynchin'
When we're done with this these songs are our pension
MCs are puppets, Me, I'm Jim Henson
Take a squat or get chopped by the henchmen
City, town, state arena or convention
Please believe these the G's that ease tension
Rakka and Ev said it's a marathon
So song after song, we keep on inventin'
We vibrate at higher frequencies
Welcome to our world and intro to
Fall into a space
Where there is no thoughts
Just moments captured
Here we go
We vibrate at higher frequencies
Let us up inside of your head
Just step inside our world of vibrations
Bump this from your birth to your deathbed

We vibrate at higher frequencies
Welcome to our world
An intro to fall into space
Where there is no thoughts
Just moments captured
Here we go
We vibrate at higher frequencies uh
Let us up inside your head
Just uh
Step inside a world
Of vibrations
Bump this
From your birth
To your death bed
Welcome
