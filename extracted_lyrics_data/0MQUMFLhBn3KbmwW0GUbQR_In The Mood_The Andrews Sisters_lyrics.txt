By Andrews Sisters
Mr. Whatchacallim, whatcha doin' tonight?
Hope you're in the mood, because I'm feelin' just right!
How's about a corner with a table for two?
Where the music's mellow and some gay rendezvous!
There's no chance romancin' with a blue attitude!
You've got to do some dancin' to get in the mood!
Sister Whatchacallim that's a timely idea!
Something swing-a-dilla would be good to my ear!
Everybody must agree that dancin' has charms
When you have that certain one you love in your arms!
Steppin' out with you will be a sweet interlude!
Oh build'er up for that would put me in the mood!
In the mood!
That's it!
I got it!
In the mood!
Your ear will spot it!

Oh what a hot hit!
Be alive
And get the jive
You've got to learn how!
Hep-hep-hep!
Hep like a hepper!
Pep-pep-pep!
Hot as a pepper!
Step-step-step!
Step like a stepper!
From muggin' to huggin'
We're in the mood now!
Mr. Watchacallim, All you needed was fun!
You can see the wonders that this evening has done!
Your feet were so heavy, till they hardly could move!
Now they're light as feathers and you're right in the groove!
You were only hungry for some musical food!
You're positively absolutely in the mood!
Sister watchacallim, I'm indebted to you!
It all goes to show what good a new hit could do!
Never felt so happy and so fully alive!
It seems that jammin' jumpin' is a powerful jive!
Swing-a-roo has given me a new attitude!
My heart is full of rhythm and I'm in the mood!
In the mood!
That's it!
'Cause I got it!
And I'm–
