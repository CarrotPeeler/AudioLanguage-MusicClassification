1 ContributorMr. Rain LyricsFalling down, cold upon my window
Lonely sound, tell me where did you go? Oh baby
You think you'll find me crying
But I'll be ready this time
Mr. Rain, Mr. Rain
All day long, I search the sky for change
Now I need you touch, what can you arrange? Oh baby
You think you'll find me crying
But I'll be ready soon
Here it comes again
Dropping in just like an old friend
(rain) Just when you crave the sun, (Mr. Rain)
You'll wet your tongue on Mr. Rain
Mr. Rain, Mr. Rain, oh Mr. Rain
Long ago we spent our magic hour
Now I pray for rain, I need it's healing power. Oh Baby
You think you'll find me crying
But I'll be ready this time Mr. Rain
Oh Mr. Rain, Oh

(Whoa) Here it comes again
Dropping in just like an old friend
(rain) Just when you crave the sun, (Mr. Rain)
You'll wet your tongue on Mr. Rain, Mr. Rain
(Whoa) Oh yeah, Here it comes again
Dropping in just like an old friend
(rain) Just when you crave the sun, (Mr. Rain)
You'll wet your tongue on Mr. Rain, Mr. Rain
(Whoa) Oh yeah, Here it comes again
Dropping in just like an old friend
(rain) Just when you crave the sun, (Mr. Rain)
You'll wet your tongue on Mr. Rain, Mr. RainYou might also likeEmbed
