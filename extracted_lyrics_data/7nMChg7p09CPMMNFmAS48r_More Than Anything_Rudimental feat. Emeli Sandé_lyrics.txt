6 ContributorsMore Than Anything Lyrics
I’m on my knees, begging please
Teach me how to love like my mother baby
She loved him every day, thick and thin
She loved daddy like crazy
I would kill, I would steal
Have a feel, have a heart like my brother
He’d run from life, won’t think twice
Give his life to fight for his baby mama

See if I could love
Don’t you think that I’d love somebody?
If I could trust
Don’t you think that I’d let you touch me?
Teach me to love
I hope there’s still hope for me
‘Cause I wanna love
I wanna love

More than anything
More than anything
Teach me everything
I wanna love

I wanna feel your kiss
Oh I mean really feel it
What I would give
To say you didn’t really mean it
I wanna ride over that
And the kids on television
God knows I try
God knows I try


Don’t you leave me
Don’t you leave me
