1 ContributorSOS (Anybody Out There?) Lyrics
Anybody out there?
Anybody out there?

The wind is blowing hard and I can't see
There’s darkness all around
The clouds are over me
My life is fast and flashing before my eyes
Will I ever see the sun again?
Will I make it out alive?
Shot a flare in the air
Oh less hope, only know I'll be waiting
Is there anyone there?
Is there anyone out there?

Is there anybody out there?
Can you help me? Help me!
I'm sending out an SOS, SOS
Come rescue me!
Is there anybody out there?
Can you help me? Save me!
I’m sending out an SOS
Come rescue me!
Is there anybody out there? (there)
Is there anybody out there? (there)
Is there anybody out there? (there, ooh yeah)
You might also like
I'm lost and turned around
I'm breaking down
Oh father, can you hear me?
I'm calling on you now!
This cold and weary day won't go away
You're the only one who can save me
I cannot find my way...
Shot a flare in the air
Oh less hope, only know I'll be waiting
Is there anyone there?
Is there anyone out there?

Is there anybody out there?
Can you help me? Help me!
I'm sending out an SOS, SOS
Come rescue me!
Is there anybody out there?
Can you help me? Save me!
I’m sending out an SOS
Come rescue me!

I’m holding on out here
I'm here out all alone
I wait for you and will not let go
I hear you coming for me
With you in wanna be!
I’m right here, i can finally see
Is there anybody out there? (there)
Is there anybody out there? (there)
Is there anybody out there? (there, oh yeah)
Is there anybody out there?
Is there anybody out there?
Is there anybody out there?
Is there anybody out there?
Is there anybody out there?
Is there anybody out there?Embed
