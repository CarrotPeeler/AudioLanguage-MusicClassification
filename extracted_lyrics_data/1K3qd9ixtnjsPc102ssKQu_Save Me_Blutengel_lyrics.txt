2 ContributorsSave Me LyricsEverything you touch turns to black
Everything you're staring at turns to stone
You can kill with the words you say
You can make me suffer with your lust
Will you try to rescue me?
Will you try to make me smile?
Will you try to save my soul?
In this coldness of time
I want to trust you, I want to belive
I let myself dive into your lies
I kiss the blood from your poisend sword
You vanquish my heart when you look at me
Will you try to rescue me?
Will you try to make me smile?
Will you try to save my soul?
In this coldness of time
Will you try to save me?You might also likeEmbed
