Mr. 305
I want everybody (Akon)
To get ready (Clinton Sparks)
'Cause we about to shut down (Snake)

Ohh-ohh
Can't tell me nothing now
Baby, I know how to fly
Ohh-ohh
Can't nothing hold me down, I'm gonna touch the sky
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Can't nothing, no, hold me down
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
(Can't nothing no, hold me down)
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
(Can't nothing no, hold me down)
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
(Now watch me, now watch me, watch me shut this thang down)

Sube sube, hasta la nube
Pa delante-lante
No mires pa tras
See Pitbull LiveGet tickets as low as $83You might also like
I hit the jackpot cha-cha-cha-cha-cha-cha-ching
Real chicos do real things on the road to the riches and diamond rings
Moved up from the streets, graduated hustla
On his way to an entrepreneur, undefeated, double shooter

Now baby, save me, from the game before it plays me
My life's a movie, call me Martin Scorsese
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
I couldn't care less if you love me or hate me
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Life's a bitch, now fuck you, pay me (Woo)

Sube sube, hasta la nube
Pa delante-lante
No mires pa tras

(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Woo
Lose my money, honey, now pay me what you owe me
Mami's a hurricane, you should see the way she blows me
I don't make it rain, I speak that global warming
This ain't no Biggie "Ready to Die" number five, there is no (Warning)

Now baby, save me, from the game before it plays me
My life's a movie, call me Martin Scorsese
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
I couldn't care less if you love me or hate me
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)

Life's a bitch, now fuck you, pay me (Woo!)

Sube sube, hasta la nube
