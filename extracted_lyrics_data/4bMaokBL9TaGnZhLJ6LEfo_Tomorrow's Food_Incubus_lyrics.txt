4 ContributorsTomorrowâ€™s Food Lyrics
(Ooh-ooh-ooh) I know you vie for the good old days
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh) And with less of us around, we were a cinch to sway
(Ooh-ooh-ooh) Does it feel like it's the end of the world?
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh) Well maybe it is, but when was it not

'Cause it's true, me and you
We are all tomorrow's food
Today

Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

(Ooh-ooh-ooh) There's no such thing as the good old days
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh) The older we all get, the better we all were
(Ooh-ooh-ooh) There's no such thing as the end of the world
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh) (But just in case) You'd best batten down and button up

Because it's true, me and you
We are all tomorrow's food
Today
