8 ContributorsNot Butter Lyrics
I can't believe it's not butter

I love it, it tastes great
You can put it on bread
You can dip your lobster in it
You can put it on popcorn
You can put it on potatoes
You can put it on muffins
You can put it on anything

But you know what?

I can't believe it's not butter

Not butter
Not butter
Not butter
Not butter
Not butter
Not butter
Not butter
Not butter
