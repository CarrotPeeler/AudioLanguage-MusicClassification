You're a little play toy
Oy oy oy
And fun thing
You're so easy
Cut loose run wild
You little wild thing
Cut loose run wild
Over me
Run wild over me
I don't look back
What's done is done
And fun thing
You've got a big wild world
Cut loose run wild
You little wild thing
Cut loose run wild
Over me
Run wild over me
Walk where you want to walk
Choose what you want to choose
Talk when you want to talk
Do what you want to do
You might also likeFun thing
Your life's your own
Do what you do
And fun thing
You never have to change
Cut loose run wild
You little wild thing
Cut loose run wild
Over me
Run wild over me
Fun thing
Fun thing
