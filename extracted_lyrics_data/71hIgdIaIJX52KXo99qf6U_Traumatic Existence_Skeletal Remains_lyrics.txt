Trauma Reassures His Sanity Can No Longer Be Saved
Horrible Acquaintance of Life Expiration
These Haunting Nightmares of civil annihilation
Time passes by
Still suffering day and night
Flashes from the past
Memories Of how they died
Bloodbath Trauma, fields of corpses rotting
Torn apart, flesh and steel colliding
Trying to Escape these flashes of the massacres
Lurking Fears avenging me viciously
Time passes by
Still suffering day and night
Flashes from the past
Memories Of how they diedYou might also likeEmbed
