Hey, life, I am still here
Can we get it if we go together?
Hey, life, I am still here
We can get it if we go together
Ah-da-da-da-da-da-da-da

Hey, life, I am calling your name
But all I hear is an echo unless your voice and mine sound the same
But, hey, life, I love you so much, I scream and shout
But I'm one foot in, one foot out
Just kind of like running on a roundabout
You know

Now I don't wanna run out, but I'm runnin', runnin'
I don't know where to go, but I can't seem to go slowly, no
I don't wanna run out, so I'm runnin', runnin'
Hey, hey, hey, hey, life, why do you keep me around?

I can never seem to focus on the task at hand
Ten times a day, I don't seem to understand
I've spent twelve thousand, nine hundred and forty-four days alive
Amazing how a human being can still thrive
But I know my days are numbered, I should enjoy the climb
I like to smell the roses, but I'm runnin', runnin' all of the time
You might also like
I don't wanna run out, but I'm runnin', runnin'
I don't know where to go, but I can't seem to go slowly, no
I don't wanna run out, so I'm runnin', runnin'
Hey, hey, hey, hey, life, why do you keep me around?
I don't wanna run out, but I'm runnin', runnin'
I don't know where to go, but I can't seem to go slowly, no
I don't wanna run out, so I'm runnin', runnin'
Hey, hey, hey, hey, life, why do you keep me around?

I woke up feeling albatrossy, flossing my teeth
I look fine on the surface, but I'm worried about what's underneath
I woke up with a heartbeat like a panic attack
Yackity-yackity-yackity-yackity-yack
I can't tell my brain to not talk back
But, hey, life, won't you push me around?
Like a baby in a carriage 'til you pull me underground
Like a kid who is lost, waiting to be found

One, two, three o'clock, four o'clock, walk and walk and talk and talk and walk and talk
And then five, six, seven, seven, seven, Heaven, Heaven, take me again
One, two, three o'clock, four o'clock, walk and walk and talk and talk and walk and talk
And then five, six, seven, seven, seven, Heaven, Heaven, take me again
One, two, three o'clock, four o'clock, walk and walk and talk and talk and walk and talk
And then five, six, seven, seven, seven, Heaven, Heaven, take me again
One, two, three o'clock, four o'clock, walk and walk and talk and talk and walk and talk
And then five, six, seven, seven, seven, Heaven, Heaven, take me again
I don't wanna run out, but I'm runnin', runnin'
I don't know where to go, but I can't seem to go slowly, oh
I don't wanna run out, so I'm runnin', runnin'
Hey, hey, hey, hey, life, why do you keep me around?
I don't wanna run out, but I'm runnin', runnin'
I don't know where to go, but I can't seem to go slowly, oh
I don't wanna run out, so I'm runnin', runnin'
Hey, hey, hey, hey, life, why do you keep me around?

Hey, hey, hey, life, why do you keep me around?
Hey, hey, hey, life, why do you keep me around?
Hey, hey, hey, life, why do you keep me around?
Hey, hey, hey, lifeEmbed
