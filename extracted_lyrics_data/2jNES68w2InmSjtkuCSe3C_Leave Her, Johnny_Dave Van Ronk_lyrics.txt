3 ContributorsLeave Her, Johnny LyricsOh, times were hard and the wages low
“Leave her, Johnny, leave her.”
I guess it’s time for us to go
“It’s time for us to leave her.”
Beware these packet ships, I say
“Leave her, Johnny, leave her.”
They’ll steal your stores and your clothes away
“It’s time for us to leave her.”
There’s Liverpool Pat with his tarpaulin hat
“Leave her, Johnny, leave her.”
And Yankee John, the pocket rat
“It’s time for us to leave her.”
She would not wear and she would not stay
“Leave her, Johnny, leave her.”
She shipped great seas both night and day
“It’s time for us to leave her.”
Its rotten beef and waverly bread
“Leave her, Johnny, leave her.”
It was pump or drown, the old man said
“It’s time for us to leave her.”
The sails all furled, our work is done
“Leave her, Johnny, leave her.”
And now ashore we’ll take our run
“It’s time for us to leave her.”
Oh, what will us poor shellbacks do?
“Leave her, Johnny, leave her.”
Our money’s gone, more work to do
“It’s time for us to leave her.”You might also likeEmbed
