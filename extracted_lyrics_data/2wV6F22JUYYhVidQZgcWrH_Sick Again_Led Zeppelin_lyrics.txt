26 ContributorsSick Again Lyrics
From the window of your rented limousine
I caught your pretty blue eyes
One day soon, you're gonna reach sixteen
Painted lady in the city of lies

Oh, do you know my name?
Do I look the same?
You know I'm the one you want, babe
I must be the one you need, yeah

Clutching pages from your teenage dream
In the lobby of the Hotel Paradise
Through the circus of the L.A. queens
How fast you'll learn the downhill slide

Oh, how you like my face?
Still don't know your name
You know I'm the one you want, babe, ooh, yes
I must be the one you need, need, need, need, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, you've got to tell me

You might also like
Just a minute, just a minute

Lips like cherries on the brow of a queen
Come on, flash across in my eyes
Said you dug me since you were thirteen
Then you giggle as you heave and sigh

Oh, do you know my name?
Do I look the same?
Baby, I gotta tell you, I'm the one you want
And everybody know I'm the one you need, yeah

Oh, give it to me
Come on now
Come on now
Come on now

Hours, hours, and the moments in between
Oh, baby, how the time flies
The fun of coming, oh, the pain in leaving
Baby, dry those silver eyes
Oh, do you know my name?
Do I look the same?
You know I'm the one you want, ooh, yes
I'm the one you need, yeah

Ooh, that's right
Ooh, yeah, that's right
Ooh, that's right
That's right
That's right
Ooh, yeah, that's right
That's right
Aah, aah, aah, aah, aah
