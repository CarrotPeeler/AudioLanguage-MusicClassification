8 ContributorsLay Me Back Down Lyrics
Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah

Oh I remember things, not many things
Don't remember where my feet touch the ground
I remember every word and every sound
I remember every word and every sound
I remember things, not many things
Don't remember when the ships hit the sea
Yeah, I remember my name and what they paid for me

Bop-ba-ba-da, ba-ba-da, ba-ba-da-da
Bop-ba-ba-da, ba-ba-da
Lay me back down
In the bed with the cold-hearted people
Listen to the word
Lay me back down
In the holes and the warmth that we've warmed up
Bop-ba-ba-da, ba-ba-da, ba-ba-da-da
Listen to the word
Bop-ba-ba-da, ba-ba-da
Lay me back down

I remember things not many things
Don't remember presidents or what they did
I remember the wars and just who profited
I remember the wars and just who profited
I remember things not many things
Don't remember places in time
I don't remember when the ships hit the sea
I remember the love and just who gave me it

Bop-ba-ba-da, ba-ba-da
Lay me back down
In the bed with the cold-hearted people
Listen to the word
Lay me back down
In the holes and the warmth that we've warmed up
Bop-ba-ba-da, ba-ba-da, ba-ba-da-da
Listen to the word
Bop-ba-ba-da, ba-ba-da
Lay me back

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Lay me back
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Lay me back
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Lay me back down
Lay me back down
(Lay me back down)
Lay me back down

Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah
Ah-I hear them calling me back to the ground
Lay me back down
In the holes and the warmth that we've warmed up
Listen to the word
Lay me back down
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Lay me back down
Lay me back downEmbed
