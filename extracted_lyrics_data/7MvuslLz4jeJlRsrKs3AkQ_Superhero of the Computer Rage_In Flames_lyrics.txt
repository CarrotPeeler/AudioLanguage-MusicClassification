4 ContributorsSuperhero of the Computer Rage Lyrics
I am the past, the future
I've been chosen
You think it's over
But I'm ready to go
I'm what you fear
I've been chosen
The world as you know it just died
It's the end of all time

I am a surprise
Even to myself I'm a genius
Superhero of the computer rage
In plastic I'll bury
I am what you fear
I've been chosen
The world as you know it just died
It's the end of all time

Everything you say is denied
I'll be the devil on this ride

Dark clouds in your heaven
Your end has only begun
You can scream but there's no rescue
I promise I'll make you sure that you die in time
You might also like
I am the maggot
In your infected life
No matter how hard you try
I'll leave without a scar
I am a legend
In your infotainment life
It's when I say it's over
It's you who's been chosen

Everything you say is denied
I'll be the devil on this ride

Dark clouds in your heaven
Your end has only begun
You can scream but there's no rescue
I promise I'll make that you sure you die in time


Everything you say is denied
I'll be the devil on this ride
(Dark clouds in your heaven)
You can scream but there's no rescue
I promise I'll make that you sure you die
Dark clouds in your heaven
Your end has only begun
You can scream but there's no rescue
I promise I'll make sure that you're deadEmbed
