1 ContributorOne Night LyricsTimes I recall
In fleeting colours
In missing hours
On days that fall
Like leaves in autumn
And blown around
And left unspoken
Times I recall
That made me restless
And anxious wandering
And words that fall
Into the deepness
Of my yearning
And left unsaid
One night one night
I had a dream
A wave came floating
Like a gleam
One day one day
All I've seen will come true
'cause night and day
I'm in love with you
Times I recall
Close to your breath
The sweet caress
The joy that falls
Into the blindness
Of my heart
And left unspoken
You might also likeTimes I recall
Few moments of care
Maybe unaware
And I did not fall
Remained in elation
And left my darkness
And left unsaid
One night one night
I had a dream
A wave came floating
Like a gleam
One day one day
All I've seen will come true
'cause night and day
I'm in love with you3Embed
