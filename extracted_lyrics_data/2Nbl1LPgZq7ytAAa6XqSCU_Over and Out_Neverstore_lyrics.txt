1 ContributorOver And Out LyricsEmptiness and regrets
These walls are filled with anger
The season's at a changing state
I'm panic in slowly
Not yet, not yetâ€¦
All my words are fading out
Only a matter of time now
With no belief I'm free
I hope they never find me
Time ticks by ever so slowly
I sign out I won't be coming home tonight
'Coz there's no room for me and my misery
I'm leaving Sunday city for good
Over and out
Days pass by and so do I
Moving in slow motion
Fake a smile I'm in denial
I hate getting older
Time tick by ever so slowly
I sign out I won't be coming home tonight
'Coz there's no room for me and my misery
I'm leaving Sunday city for good
Over and out
You might also likeCan only assume things will change
And maybe go back to normal
It's just a phase, it's just a phase
I'm trying to figure it out
By turning my back to these moments of doubt
Surrender, surrender, surrender, surrender
I sign out I won't be coming home tonight
'Coz there's no room for me and my misery
I'm leaving Sunday city for good
Over and out
