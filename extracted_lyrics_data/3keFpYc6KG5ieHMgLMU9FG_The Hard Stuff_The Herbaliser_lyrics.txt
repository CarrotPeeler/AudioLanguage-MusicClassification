10 ContributorsFire in the Booth Lyrics
I'm still on the roads and yeah I'm stressed out
I'm piffing on the lemon got me zessed out
19 hours on the road 5 hours rest now
But from my head to my toes I'm looking fresh now
I'm still impressing them hoes I'm hugh heffner
I'm back on the roads now I'm fresh out
Life's one big journey and its a test now
I said a big journey and its a test now
I'm pissed off whole life's still a criss cross
Tryna take the right path the wrong path kicked off
And I was real low then I licked off
Now I'm moving cold on the road like a tip-top
And let my niggas sell the rocks no slip knot
I'm moving so wavey like a flip flop
I'm out to get the big belly no Rick Ross
I'm out to get the big belly look...
Look deep into my eyes and look properly
I'm all about my mullah like monopoly
I said money money money ain't stopping me
I'm out here leave your shirt bloody if you're watching me
And yeah haters keep talking like you know this
I'm out to get bread like the Hovis
I said money money money that's my motive
I said money money money that's my motive
I'm out to get p's I'm a clever lad
I'm writing up some bars in the memo pad
I make you see stars if you think you're bad
I'm reminiscing about my  fam I'm a dad
I wake up I was feeling sad but I gotta bounce back fam cus I'm a dad
I said big boy tunes when we're in the lab
And now the rains getting hard now I need a mac
Don't sleep at night now I need a nap
I might run up in your crib for your p's and that
And if you see sutting nice I ain't leaving that
Have a holiday Bahamas beach and that
You might also like
Im sipping on my goose reminiscing
Another year without my mum it's hard  but  im living
Turned off my phone im in the zone now I'm chilling
Blazing on my S it's pure lemon what I'm billing
Real life rap got the hometown singing
Got the new vocals plus Shadow on the riddim
Big boy zoots for the Saga's that I been in
I break hearts still pray for my sinning
Haters try bring a brother down but I'm winning
Got my conscience telling me why is it now that I did it
When it's your time it's your time yeah it's written
When it's your time it's your time yeah it's written
Take time out go connect with them spirits
Graveyard visits, real rap living
So much pain in my life I ain't finished
So much pain in my life I ain't finished like...
It's getting silly now Henny and the Goose get the  out
It's getting kinda cold getting chilly now
And man a do the dab cus we're winning now
 It's getting silly now Henny and the Goose get the  out
It's getting kinda cold getting chilly now
And man a do the dab cus we're winning now
It's time to move grown on that big tip
One'r on the 30 lanes it's mad but it's risky
It's time to hit the hussle like I'm lipsy
Shows got me driving up and down like I'm gypsy
Warm up sessions new tracky boss strictly
Yard man ting since I picked me
Nice browning apni or a sikhni
Sick made kala getting paper cus I flipped P
I like to mix my hash with the lemon
Late night graft for the cash fuck the weather
Make tings blast for the past I'm on my ever
Yeah I'm out for that cash mozzarella
I mix my hash with the am
Late night graft for the cash what's the plan
Big 45 no 9 won't jam
Big 45 no 9 won't jam
2016 is a deep year
Fire in the booth on a leap year
It's like bars I renewed them
Before I leave this booth I'm getting many 
Haters can't talk no more because I mute them
Yeah I ride round here I might oot them
Haters can't talk no more because I mute them
Cause a riot in your yard like I'm looting
It's mad how the time goes
Trapping and stacking tryna write loads
Old friends tryna snake me out for some light dough
Nice browning big back that's my type bro
I said it's mad how the time goes
Trapping and stacking tryna write loads
Old friends tryna snake me out for some light dough
Nice browning big back that's my type bro
It's getting silly now Henny in the Goose get the  out
It's getting kinda cold getting chilly now
And man a do the dab cus we're winning now
It's getting silly now Henny in the Goose get the  out
It's getting kinda cold getting chilly now
And man a do the dab cus we're winning now

I hit big man with a big slap
Make big man have a big nap
Then we come true with the big strap
Don't think cus I'm with my youte or my ting that you won't get kidnapped
Get colder than winter
I want a meal to land
Something like Inter Milan
Yeah I got p's and dank
I'm out to get G's you prick
I'm hot I'm steaming prick
Likkle bird give J's get P's in quick
Kick back with a drink get lean off piff
And it's mist  with gov
That's stuff lurch and Lynch
You better talk up quick
Get standard Road quick
Fuck the PIGZ
I'm thinking of life fuck all the stripes
Want P's for my KIDZ
Got gassed in crash and I nearly died now I gotta kickback on the weekend
Should I kick back on the weekend? Nah
It was Christmas season robbing and thieving
Man get robbed then eaten
I'm winning I'm on a mic far from chilling
When Im on a hype
I got 2 Spliff's In my mouth but I'm still billing
I'll put couple slots In him
Head back to the hood blood
Laughing and grinning
Thought you was hard soft like linen
Thought you was hard soft like linen
Out in the CMD
Dun'kno I'm out for the P that's me
I'm mist I'm a sick made Kala G
And when it comes to the bars I come like Ken block
You can't Park like me
And we know who the real dargs are because pussyhole you can't bark like me
I said you can't bark like me
I've switched started G
Head darg I'm a rarted G
I'm back MIS to the T
Man get clapped with the thing try fucking with me
Man get  with your Tea
I'll get your food like food double E
Man don't sell food on the street like I've seen
I've seen bars that don't flow to the beat
Like Mist is speaking
Mist is creaping
Man might creap when you sleep
Brand new bars might turn man weak
Man get shook when you hear man speak
Like I've already told man make your head top leak
Man get hit with a headshot peak
I don't play no tricks like treat
Man get hit with a head shit
About moving equipped
I'll shown man about moving equipped
When I'm moving with my stick
Late night you might see me on the block moving the brick
Constantly I be moving the piff
If you come to my ends more than a risk
Haze on my brain herbalist
Heard a couple guy tried taking the piss
Like lately I've been thinking of this
Maybe I should burst on my stick that any guy that think Mist is a prick in a hotterz try pass rinsing my stick with my gloves on never leave prints on a stick
Sickmade Kala prick with my gloves on never leave prints on a stick
Sickmade Kala prick
Like... Kala skank
Kalas Apnas skank
Like... Kala skank
Kalas Apnas skank
Like... Kala skank
Kalas Apnas skank
Like... Kala skank
Kalas Apnas skank
