1 ContributorRose of Flesh and Blood LyricsBaby, you're millions of things
Wishes obscene dreams
I don’t know yet
Maybe it explains
All these millions of miles
Between us laid on the same bed
Why so much alcohol?
Speed, sleeping pills, I ask myself
I could make easier your escape
But I am afraid too
I must confess
Your trails have been so uncertain
Iron curtain those sheets that divide us
Not even a russian missile
Would break such solid silence
I hate every single day after
I look to my side
And you are not there
Night has just fallen
And you are lost again
I don't know in anywhere
I read your name in the night lights
Ambulances and police cars
A strobe that flashes forever
I read your name in the night lights
In the basement of a night club
In a strobe that flashes forever
Baby, you're millions of things
Wishes obscene dreams
I don’t know yet
Maybe it explains all the miles
That I walked down into the sewer
There I could rest
Why so much contempt?
Why so few talking
I ask myself
But I can wait for the morning
When your bleeding petals
Will water the whole neon garden
You're a rose of flesh and blood
You're temptation for the pure
You're redemption for the clodEmbed
