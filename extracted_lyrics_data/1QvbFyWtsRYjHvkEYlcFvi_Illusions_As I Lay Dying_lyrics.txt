6 ContributorsIllusions LyricsYeah
Could I ever go back, back to the life where I lived amongst the dead?
How could I go back, to live amongst the dead who have forgotten how to feel?
And become slaves to memory, and wishful thinking?
But your love has set me free as you awaken every star that has been sleeping in the constellation of my soul
How could I go back to live amongst the dead?
How could I go back to live amongst the dead?
How could I go back to live amongst the dead?
How could I go back to live amongst the dead?
Those who imprisoned beauty
I never want to leave your arms
So I wait in hope for your embrace, for your embrace
I wait in hope for your embrace
I wait in hope for your embrace
Yeah
