5 ContributorsRomper Stomper Lyrics
Yeah 1,2,3,4
It's a knock down drag out one on one
Think it's over when it's just begun
Cause round here they'll fight for fun
On my feet, don't think to run
Two-Face gets bust in both mouths
Backstabbers get shanked out no doubt
Turn and walk, you lose all clout
Just want to know what you're about

Gonna lie de facto
Lie de facto
Don't cross the line man
You fall through the cracks scent
Nobody's neutral
Nobody's neutral
You stand alone in your fucking nightmare
Don't turn your back 'cuz
Don't turn your back 'cuz
That leaves the front yeah
Open target
I got your back so
I got your back so
Know how to soothe your mind
You might also like
I want to know
I want to know
I want to know
Can I count on you when it's time?

If I got your back then you best have mine
When it goes down lay it on the line
Die for you, well that's just fine
Just let me know, don't waste my time
Friends I have, one reason to die
What we got, we will get by
No matter what stand and side by side
Walk on through with our heads held high
