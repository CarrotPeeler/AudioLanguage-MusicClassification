19 ContributorsThe Cookout Cypher Lyrics
Brrt!
Samad cook it up, yer
Uh, yeah

I'm the chosen one, Luke, not Obi Wan
I've been skywalkin', sky's the limit so I float above (Ha)
Been going nowhere like hitchhikers wit' a broken thumb (Uh)
Guess it's time to show 'em what a G.O.A.T. is, hit a Kobe dunk (Woo)
Never miss a shot, pistol pop, fuck a molar gun (Pew)
Roll up to the homes of my opponents wit' a loaded gun (Brrt)
Whip it out on anybody ever talkin' shit or doubtin'
I don't need a bag full of clubs to go put a hole in one (Pew)
Untuck the llama then run up on 'em, we come for drama (Uh)
They call me Ra, I'm the Sun God 'cause I burn the hottest (Uh)
Fire-breathin', been cookin' shit like it's Benihana's (Uh)
Yeah, that's why your squad stayin' underwater, Bikini Bottom (Uh)
Thinkin' it's time to go so wicked, I never let enemy ever get on a roll
When I spit it with infinite, witness student of the game just made the honor roll
Honorable scholar with knowledge, that is greater than your college
That's why they call me a god, I gotta go

Yo, Crypt, you a fool for this one
Yo
You might also like
When I'm online, my pen is a lonely man
We catch bodies onscreen like it's OnlyFans
I don't catch too many shots, they sub-trippin'
Quarantine barber, they see a nigga cut different
The drum attached, make 'em rattle like FAMU
Shoot and miss, that's your last shot, last chance, you
My university is versus from adversity
That urges me to stay strapped up; Steve Urkel's team
Family matters, y'all be screamin' again
But don't just do it 'cause you see that it's convenient to care (Yeah)
This my reality show, them niggas been soft
Act a fool, then revolve, I'll give you a spin-off
I'm servin' rounds, Sam Malone with the "Cheers" touch
Round after round 'til we all get a beer gut
Fear what? Ain't nobody killin' me
I zoned out like we got defensive liabilities
D.I.L.E.M.A!

Yeah, god Grizzy

I'm too gifted, I've been rippin' rappers way before Christmas (Yeah)
Got 'em open off the presence, ain't no point in flexin' (What?)
Been hot since '9-7, got these wack rappers beggin' (Fire)
For a feature, his style's too plain, 9/11 (9/11)
I'm in the buildin', fuck a deal, labels are fake (Fuck)
They 'gon do you like the Trunchbull, put some cake in your face
And when your records ain't sellin', they quick to take it away (Boom)
Make you pay back every single dollar that you made (Rrr-aah!)
Ayy, this a cold game, labels got these artists so trained (So trained)
Don Cornelius and rappers still thinking like slaves (Slaves)
That's why we screamin' "Please give us back the old Ye" (Old Ye)
But I not speaky Spanish or talky like Jorge (Jorge)
'Prende ese, show paper won't get you paid (Nah)
All I got in this world is my balls, Scarface (All I got)
And no's, I won't break, drivin' in my own lane (Lane)
Just some niggas wit' a attitude, ask O'Shea (Skrrt!)
Yeah, E.K., look

Here's a penny for your thoughts, a nickel for the scars
A quarter for the ones who are steady defyin' odds
Somethin' 'bout the universe just never makes sense
Being rich does not equate to happiness, what a myth
Learn a lot from "Paid in Full", more money, more problems
That's the underlyin' truth, quick to stab you in the back for a couple of views
And temporary ten seconds, y'all be gone with the news
How much more I gotta prove?
Shit, I grew up on the Ems and the Jays and the Coles
Little Nas, Big and Pac, Rakim, a little soul
I feel this in my bones, it's embedded in my core
Would be nothin' if it weren't for the legends who came before us
Got these people lookin' at me like I'm somethin' absurd
Stick around and learn somethin', got a way with these words
It's loyalty first, throw that other bullshit to the side
See no ceilings, word to Wayne, 'bout time I shine, E.K.​

Yeah, look (Yeah, look)

And it's KING BLITZ, yeah, we rap in this bitch
And you know with the flow I'm official like it's a ref in this bitch
And the way I write might leave you left in a bit
Now we on the big screen, we goin' up like watch your step in this bitch
And know the flow is still good in the drought
Switchin' with the tongue-twistin' in the Midwest, but I live in the south
King shit is only what I'm about
Got a lil' buzz goin' but I still swat a lame for gettin' fly at the mouth
Really, really, fuck you, gimme, gimme, niggas really gimmicks
Really, y'all offend me, y'all ain't any, look around, army with me
And I promise the damage is prominent, confident in these consonants
I'ma get to the bottom of it and leave you bottomless
Honestly, I'm tired of these so-called rappers who fraudulent
Promised that I'll be on the top 'cause we dominant
In the game, we 'bout to confiscate, you actually whack
And we don't actually like you, dawg, your shit got hacked
Call me a king because I'm actually that, actually facts
I'm the one in charge, you niggas battery pack, KING
Gat drawn, do a rapper bad if he act wrong
Bang, let it rain on a nigga, this a black storm
Bobby Shmurda when I throw it up, now his cap gone
All I do is scheme when I'm movin' with the mask on
Y'all gon' learn the history, I was wild, worried
On the Jim Beam, hopin' I don't lie, bury
It's cool, though, and teach a nigga the science
Hit every mark and period, I'm upper-class when I'm rhymin'
I pull out this missile, hit you and get a nigga bell ring
Slayed 'em, then I screech off when the bell ding
Heard your last project, sorry, it's Reg
You should leave the ass rappin' to Cardi and Meg
I see you shook lil' niggas be actin' nervous when I come around
Lookin' at the fuckin' ground, see the sucker in your smile
Tighten up, pussy, ain't you happy I'm here?
New on the scene, Murkemz, the rapper you fear, yeah!

Ayy, I'm feelin' like a problem when I'm on that kush and coffee
Not a crab in a bucket, so I'm shakin' niggas off me
Tryna catch this wave, but I leave 'em lookin' salty
Careful, 'cause my pistol like my finger, she's so naughty
Me and my homies linkin' like a chain, they label us a gang
Since we lock it down like we married to the game
Put a ring on her finger, gave that bitch my last name
If she step out of line, I'm cashin' in insurance claims
Side note, chain-smoking with the gang, rollin' up some dank
Runnin' to the bank, I'm gonna elevate my name
I'm never in one spot, I like to move around, if you try and stop me, you 'gon get walked down
Might just have to leave your body on the ground
Make sure you never make a sound
I can't hear you since this beat is way too loud, ayy
Light a blunt, proceed to face it, doin' what I have to
I'm gonna make it, no more bullshit, I think it's time to escape it
This is my reality and only I can choose to change it
Drivin' by myself, hopin' that I make it, gang

I'm out at Crypt's, about to put y'all in one, yeah (Ha)
You standin' out until we talkin' income, yeah (That's facts)
Y'all just crack up under pressure, you tortilla chips (Woo)
Came with tools and ratchets like I really fuckin' need a fix (Brra!)
Waitin' 'round the table like you need a tip
I've been in my fort all night inside like this was season six (Goddamn)
Came here for tunes, and now I'm leavin' wit' a fortune (Ching)
Fortunately, I'm tuned up and I don't need another portion (Nah)
Flow is holy on the seas, yeah, we all know this why they worship (What?)
Y'all can't match it, keep it lit, then I'ma make sure that I torch it (Yeah)
Crypt got me in Kentucky wit' a asshole, yeah (Wit' a asshole)
Fuck it though, tequila all up in the glass, go
Y'all be steady toyin' 'round, fuck what you has, bro (Ha)
I'm up to here with how you think, I'm feelin' mad low (Woo)
They had me waitin' to go, yeah, throwin' the buffalo woes, yeah
I don't get fixed at the court and I'm hot on the metal, my faith in the road (Let's go)
Lovin' my taste and they fold, yeah, see that I'm winnin' the gold
I got my ice on one pen in the verse and they know that I really been froze (Post)

When you move like a god, it always come with grace
Team got plenty for anybody who wanna hate
And I don't care how they kill him, boy, I just want him ate
So when the metal hit his mug, he just sunk in place
Hunnid-K Holla, I chill in Bahamas
Come home to your crib and throw dick in your mama
Then I dip, stick shift with your sister, Ramada
Threesome on OnlyFans with the chick that's beside you
It get vicious, her leg up, she turned, flip switch
Swore she was Kirby the way she sucked this shit
You mad, we grip sticks, find out she told you about us
Harry Potter, grab the sweepers and, get this, snitch
I don't think you understand where we comin' from
I don't want to speak man-to-man, fuck a one-on-one
When the war gets thick, people want to run
And if you not one of us, then you one of them

I'm like the Slumdog Millionaire, overslept the red eye
Swung in from the chandelier and stuck it like a Jedi
Rappers get abandoned if they only play the good guy
Well, hmm, maybe that's the reason that the good die
This young boy rollin' with that old boy weakness
Y'all ain't never steppin' to the genus of a genius
Women that I wrote about would say that I'm the meanest
And they mean it, they callin' me conceited and elitist
Then they takin' to their Twitter and they tryin' to delete us
Then they see me doin' well and wanna kick it like Adidas
Nah, nah-nah, no, what you talkin' 'bout, homie?
E'erybody snappin' pictures, cheese and macaroni
A couple years ago, they would'a blocked me like a goalie
Now they're calling me a star, I wanna pat me like my homie, woah
Ayy, and now you're talking matrimony
It's cool you shot a shot, but TBH, you smacked the bogey, like

Y'all already know it's the 5'7" G.O.A.T.​
Ibn! (Chyeah)

I do this rap shit for fun (Chyeah)
We get bread, you should get you some (That's right)
If it ain't DumbLoud, nigga, it's just dumb (Uh)
I sell cars, you can get you one, I sell cribs too (C'mon)
Got a three-bedroom crib you can rent too
Fully furnished (Yeah), the rent'll be twelve-hunnid
If you really want a first month, twenty-four to secure it
You can get a hoodie, log onto the site (That's right)
When it come to bars, I don't write (I don't write)
Fuck around and scar you for life if you rap for a livin' (Life)
'Cause they be like, "Dawg, he is nice" (Nice)
I could charge you a price for these sixteens pump, punk
And I ain't write a rap in like sixteen months, I'm still sharp as a knife (That's right, woo!)
Nigga, I'm a shark, I will bite (C'mon)
And everybody swimming's brunch and then bring lunch (Yeah)
Nigga, bring the dark to the light
Your battery within me jumped (Yeah), Ibn

There's a psycho at the cookout, so look out
A fishy character on the boat so I'm glad we took the hook out
What's this chapter in my life? Get the book out
Been creepin' in the night, but it's time to pull the rook out
Introductions, huh? I'm awkward, weird, and fuckin' lame
But I'd rather play the bully kid to be part of your game
After this is done, I'll be grilled, well done
But my soul is cold, I'm always charred, well, let's have fun
My flavor doesn't pair with beef and yours is burning up
Unwanted flappin' lips you creep, don't try, you can't catch up
Get it? 'Catch up' like 'ketchup'? Your meat is overcooked
Comment down below which of my bars I overlooked
Now they all be sayin', "This dork ruined the song
It was goin' so well, why did they let this freak on?"
But real knows real and real knows you
And, in reality, this plastic face is realer than you

I'm preconditioned to seduce, but put that liquor in my system
I got problems I don't fix, so I just trade it for commission
Walk around with demons on both of my shoulders like I'm liftin'
Got them shooters in my holster, take a shot, see Smith & Wesson
I call it Coronavirus, the cauldron'll leave you cryin'
Corrodin', fuck up your sinus, you pussies'd never try this
Scoldin' with flows on Midas, potent, you can't deny this
Scorchin' and Holy Ghost, it be smolderin'; molten lava
Flippin' the script like Java, the merciless rapper mata
Got vice grips upon your collar, so worthless whack imposters
Get smashed like bottles of vodka, uh, bitch, I'm a monster, finna be spreadin' it proper
Stop at the top of the competition, listen, SEPPI killed it!

Yo, uh, ishkood
Jersey, uh, yeah

Now, if you knew what I deal with
Then mans'll know it's understandable I don't feel shit (Nah)
Don't got my math, I'll tie son in the grass, you'll kneel quick (Ha)
Coronavirus says she's scared to catch me, I'm real sick (Ooh)
Depressed as fuck, but I got a whole plethora of this mess of stuff in my head to bust
You don't really wanna test your luck with the best of us, you'll get left in dust (Ha)
Pass to the kid, bet they feel this
Mount and do your girl then pop you with the can, I'm the real Crypt (Wow)
I blew up and conquered, nobody sicker, it's been proven by doctors (Woo)
I want my plaques to look like, "Ooh, it's an Oscar!" (Hey)
Sleeping on me, I'ma let B rest like beautiful knockers (Hey)
Get these Uncle Toms up off my chest, Hakuna Matatas (Hahahaha!)
Guess I'm carefree since we all here, see, this the writer's block (Uh)
Before you draw the line, we crossed it, garbage, your mind is robbed (Uh)
You know you're gonna die, you're looking cautious like, "Why, Samad?" (Why?)
I kill you making the same face I make when I lie to cops (Skoodwidit!)
I'm not a blood, but I live the life that they hate to see (Huh)
I just balled in a court for sport, they just plagiary
They want the beef 'cause they salty, revenge is savory
And if I ain't the best on this cypher, at least I made the beat (Uh)

Aw, hell nah
Yeah, look, okay

If a dozen of us in the room, call a doctor (Yeah)
Yo, I'ma be shootin' some, but some not hurt (What?)
Five get hit, other six runnin' to the outskirts (Where?)
And five clicks, that mechanism turns twelve to one, that's clockworks (Okay)
Sike, I don't be in the mud, my dawgs act first (Right?)
I just get my bloods to come through, bruh, that's lab work (Bop)
They mad hurt 'cause the way I rap, it adds girth (Woo)
I'm fuckin' all these niggas over, so don't even ask him why his ass hurts (Haha!)
Hollow points and I got hollow drums, pop-out and the cops going, "Alright- ()
-You a mama's boy", it depends, let us see, oh, see, you nuts, you a Almond Joy ()
God damn, my man's got the highest smoke, gaslight, yes, karma knows (What? )
Kamikaze with 'Rari the way I whip up, Bill Cosby tryna ride my horse (, mmm)
Fuckin' 'round with me, I come for man's non-stop (Yeah)
I'll leave 'em teary-eyed and chokin', double hand got cuffed (Woo)
Look, are you ready to rumble? I go Michael with the boss (, yeah)
I just give 'em that Mutombo, that's the blocka-blocka shot, ya (Lex)

We ain't tryna buddy-buddy you lames
So everybody in our lane gettin' smothered in flames
Our songs leak 'cause we hot, we ain't one and the same
The only way you'd ever leak's from your jugular vein (C'mon, yeah)
And y'all don't want to come first wit' a diss (Nah)
'Cause we respond back quick with some personal shit (Uh-huh)
And I be comin' for your neck with every word that I spit (Woo!)
Just like O. J., I show 'em how to murder a bitch! (Bitch!)
Still with my day ones, been reppin' the same team (Uh)
They ask me what I do and I just tell 'em I chase dreams (Yeah)
To make cheese 'til I'm feelin' better than JAY-Z (Hova)
We keepin' it a hunnid like the weather in AZ, woah (Hot)
Now they mad 'cause I run it and I never leave (Woo! Leave)
Any girl up at my crib, I would let her be (Ha)
She in the bed with me and crawlin' like a centipede (Huh? Huh?)
Your bitch pops Xans and she's still 'gon remember me (Hoo!)
And now we keep it pushin', comin' at me, probably shouldn't (Uh, uh)
'Cause I've been winnin', doing everything you know you couldn't (Woo!)
Flame's on the beat, I ain't never heard you scorch none (Nah)
Punch you in the face and watch you break like you were porcelain (Bitch!)
If I go broke, I'll be comin' after your funds
Bitch, I've been driven since I've seen the way the Porsche runs
No debate that it's time to arrive, tell them all they don't play no games (Uh)
Y'all get paid for the nine-to-five, I get paid for the 808's (Woo)
Just evolve, I don't stay the same, , I won't fade away (Nah)
They will talk when I would take a loss, but I become a boss and I made my name (Uh)
Bitch, I've been at this for years, don't follow my peers, I follow my goals (Mmm)
Spittin' the heroin, this shit is medicine, tell 'em I'll give 'em a dose (Mmm)
Give 'em a topic and they go gossip, y'all have been doin' the most (Mmm)
Talkin' that nonsense, better be cautious, turn 'em right into a ghost, ayy (Mmm)
So I don't really got no time for you little guys (Nah!)
Livin' with your momma, but your ego twice as big as mine
It's one love, my musin' console intertwined
Constant evolution, we never think of the finish line

Yo

They at the crib rappin' while I'm at the telly, checkin' my stocks (Okay)
Time is money, so I'm checkin' the clock (Yeah)
It's hard to live in the moment when I'm noticin' the best never stop (Mmn-mmn)
And from the jump, I was projected to flop, I'm protectin' the rock
I'm off the glass when I'm measurin' shots
Ain't talking hoop, this medicine is Ciroc (Mmm)
I wish the best for everybody in this lane, I hope they get what I got (Okay)
Then pass that up on they trip to the top
Okay, but please don't get it twisted, we are not adjacent, 'cause I'm not complacent (Nah, nah, nah, nah)
Not your favorites, but your favorite got 'em some inspiration (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Ain't playin', we talkin' different, decades of makin' money moves (Sheesh!)
Struggle food, made it out the mud when you was stuck in school (Sheesh!)
Niggas ain't know what to do, gave 'em a whole manual (Manual)
Sold the catalogue, I gave 'em a whole channel (Channel)
Sellin' shoes, fuck it, I gave 'em the full Sandals (Sandals)
That mean a resort with a chef and some more candles (Ooh)
Flow make 'em nervous, they sweatin' off for the verdict (Okay!)
We just did another YouTube cypher, but this time, in person, ooh!

I'm cuttin' off loose ends, meant to say Lucid
Flow so dumb, but the opposite of stupid
Think about what you did, shoulda never mentioned a Kuf
A kick from the boot'd have your ass missin' a tooth
See, lyrically and literally, I will shit in a booth
I'm cookin' up in the stew, I'll spit in your soup
I'm the one that you don't want to collide with
I stay with the bars, no shit, I'm a convict
Lil' black nina and I call her my side chick
Shorty catch bodies like jump in this moshpit
And when it come to pressure, I'm the one that apply shit
'Cause soon as they arrest you, you're the one that's 'gon dry snitch (Yeah)
Mama always told me that my flow was the coldest, I blow this
Got 'em in a panic, got 'em fannin' like both the Dakotas
Twist it nigga, top pop, that's how you open the soda
I don't play games, can't you tell I just broke the controller?
