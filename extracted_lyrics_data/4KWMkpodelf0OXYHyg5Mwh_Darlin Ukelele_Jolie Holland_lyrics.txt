That I've been dreaming of
Darlin Ukelele
That I love
When I'm in San Francisco
I'm dreaming all the time
Deep in the park
Where the constellations shine
Darlin Ukelele
That I been dreaming of
Darlin Ukelele
That I love
Dreaming by the ocean
Walking by the sea
Talking to a starfish
And the mermaids sing to meYou might also like1Embed
