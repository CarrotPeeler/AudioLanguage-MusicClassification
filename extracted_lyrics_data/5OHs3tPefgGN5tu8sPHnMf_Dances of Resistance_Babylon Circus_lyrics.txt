1 ContributorDances of Resistance LyricsSee di yout' dem a chant an' prance
Dem a ready to play dis dance
Running from the hill like a burning lance
To the valley of abundance
So many voices on the same riddim
Singing louder than the sound system
So many colors comin' out of concrete
Come we go downtown, come we go shout on mainstreet
Dances of resistance
Push! Push! Fi give justice a chance
Dances of resistance
Push! Push! Fi mek turn di balance
See dem are scornin' on that movement
Dem think we don' t know the rules we just can' t understand
But we know We are firm an' confident
We know for which battle we stand
Dem will not deceive us again with false pretence
Get outta control get outta control
Stop that rain this is self-defense
Get outta control get outta control
Get outta control get outta control (x4)

Push! Push! Fi mek turn di balance
No work for capitalisim, no work fi communisim
No deal patriotisim, fundamentalisim
An' ya isim an' ya isim an' ya skisim au' ya cheatin' an a lyin'
All dis a skatta racisim
Clear up my mind an' give some sense
To what I feel deep down in my conscience
What can I do ? what can I do ?
I don' t know what to do, tell me what to do
But there is so much things to do, so much things to do
There is so much things to do, so much things to do

Dem a ruff an' tuff girls an' boys
Side by side in a joyful noise
Some a dem come and play trumpet an' tuba
Som a dem come and drum it inna batucada
Drum it!
