1 ContributorGold LyricsA moment's like a piece of gold
Don't spend it on the wrong thing
Every moment's something you should hold
Don't spend it on the wrong thing
Another copy paste you stupid robot
How can you go, can you go
How can you go, can you go
How can you go, can you go, go away
You're caught in the moment
It feels like a day
The fight's just beginning
Don't give it away
A breath's like an ocean
Your mind starts to stray
The motive's forgotten
It all goes away
You're real in protection
Your shield is what
Conceals imperfection
By giving it up
Come on and give it all or give it up
Give it all or give it up
Give it all or give it up
Give it all or givе it up
Give it all or give it up
Give it all or givе it up

How can you go, can you go
How can you go, can you go, go away
A moment is a piece of gold
Don't spend it on the wrong thing
Every moment's something you should hold
Don't spend it on the wrong thing
How can you go, can you go
How can you go, can you go
How can you go, can you go, go awayEmbed
