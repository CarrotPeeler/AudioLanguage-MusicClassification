1 ContributorRush of Silence LyricsIn a wasp tower station
Errant souls lose their way
"Labyrinthian Absorptions"
They must stay here forever
In their own prophecies
Of a cutthroat assassin
Tempting nocturnes on the walls
Turbid idols we adore
All distempers draw one scene
With a cross upon the hill
What a beautiful nightmare
Then I hear the rush of silence
And I know that I must save the world tonight
I fall into the rush of silence
Where are you?
Let me save you now before you have to die
With my old cosmic wind mill
A four-dimensional tube
I've erased all the timesteps
I can't live without loving in my new yesterdays
I will die here forever
No! I know I must be strong
I have waited much too long
Anyone can save the world
Anyone can, anyone can
Here's for the first time, my last time

And I know I have to save the world tonight
Fall into the rush of silence
Where are you?
Let me save you now before you have to die
I fall into the rush of silence
And I know I have to save the world tonight
Fall into the rush of silence
Where are you?
Let me kill you now before you have to dieEmbed
