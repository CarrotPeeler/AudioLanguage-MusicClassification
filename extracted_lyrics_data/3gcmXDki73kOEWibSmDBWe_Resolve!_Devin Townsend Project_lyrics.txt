4 ContributorsResolve! Lyrics
Turn your world around
Turn your world around and focus on the mind
All of this surrounds, All of this abounds when we focus on the mind!

We rise!
We rise!
We rise!

I want resolve to receive what you'll be!
The ocean returns to the sea!
I want resolve to receive what you'll be!
The ocean returns to the sea!
I, I, I, I, I will not go!
I, I, I, I, I, never!
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I!

We rise!
We rise!
We rise!

I want resolve to receive what you'll be!
The ocean returns to the sea!
I want resolve to receive what you'll be!
The ocean returns to machine
I, I, I, I, I will not go!
I, I, I, I, I, never!
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I!You might also likeEmbed
