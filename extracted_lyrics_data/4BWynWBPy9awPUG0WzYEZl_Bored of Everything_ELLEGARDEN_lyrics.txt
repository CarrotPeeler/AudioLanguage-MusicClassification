2 ContributorsBored Of Everything LyricsWake up Stand up I know But for what
One thing I crave Weekend without computer games
Pull the trigger and kill the zombies
Sorry I'm done
So many things I have let go
No doubt Wanna do something else
I need to find something before I'm bored of everything
So many things I left undone
No doubt Wanna be someone else
I need to find something before I'm bored of everything
Before I'm bored of everything
Voicemail is full I know She calls me at home
How much is my car and how much is my gift
Pull the trigger Kill the zombies
Sorry I'm done
I still can believe when you say it's not true
I still can believe when you say it's not too late
I still can believe when you say it's not real
I still can believe when you say I'm not too late
So many things I have let go
No doubt Wanna do something else
I need to find something before I'm bored of everything
So many things I left undone
No doubt Wanna be someone else
I need to find something before I'm bored of everything
Before I'm bored of everythingYou might also likeEmbed
