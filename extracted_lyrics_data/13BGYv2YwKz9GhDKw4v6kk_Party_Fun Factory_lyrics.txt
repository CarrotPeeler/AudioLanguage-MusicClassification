2 ContributorsCelebration (Mousse Tâ€™s Back to the Old School) LyricsLet's have a celebration by the sea
And get together in peace in harmony
A celebration come and have some fun
Singing oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Bang bang bang
Here comes the jam
It's the Fun Factory
Coming with the next party-jam
So what's up what's on
Baby come on tell me
Is it me is it you
Tell me tell me please
Don't play me
Chillin' with the girlies
Ridin' with the fellows in my car
Singin' dididadidida
So come on
Wave your hands in the air
So come on wave it
Like you just don`t care
And if you`re down
With the Fun Factory groove
Somebody say oh yeah
Let's have a celebration by the sea
And get together in peace in harmony
A celebration come and have some fun
Singing oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Slam slam slam
Here comes the van
It's Fun Factory
And we do the best we can
We ringadingding
And we ringaringdong
We hype up the place
With the bombastic song
We move to the left
We move to the right
And we wave
Our hands from side to side
You better step back
Cause we don`t stop
We want
Let's step together
And have some fun
There is a place
Where we have some fun
Yes it's better
All together
And we're dancing one on one
There is a place
Where we have some fun
Yes it's better
All together
And we're dancing one on one
Let's have a celebration by the sea
And get together in peace in harmony
A celebration come and have some fun
Singing oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Let's have a celebration by the sea
And get together in peace in harmony
A celebration come and have some fun
Singing oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Singing oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Singing oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
