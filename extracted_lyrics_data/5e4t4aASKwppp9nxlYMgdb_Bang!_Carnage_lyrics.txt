2 ContributorsCarnage of the Gods LyricsHear them falling
Angels falling from the sky
You can see it
See the fear in their eyes
Terrorized by them
By the old sinister ones
They make a carnage
Callous carnage of our gods
Heaven has been set on fire
And Hell has gone pitch black
Summoned in the desert sands
By a morbid putrid mass
They make deities bleed
They eat their holy insides
Make demons scream in fear
The creator they despise
Predators seek destruction
Bloodbath over our heads
Chaos they create and spread
(Their) existence is plagued with death

Blood rains from the blackened sky
Dim shadows come out of the void
A massive chant your hear
Coming from behind the sun
Architects of damnation
Enjoy beheading gods
Don't stay to see the slaughter
'Cause we are the next to burnYou might also likeEmbed
