4 ContributorsCheek to Cheek LyricsRosarita
I laid on your beach
Dreaming and drinking Tequila
I came all the way from Marina del Rey
On a plane yesterday
From the gray L.A. air
Cheek to cheek
To cheek, Chiquiti-tita
Yo soy amoroso
What could be wrong with the hombre who sings so slow
From up in Californi-o?
Rosarita
Forget that border check, please
You won't have to sneak
Two or three times a week
And your green card, tarjeta verde, need never be shown
'Cause you've got my heart on permanent loan
Cheek to cheek
To cheek, Chiquiti-tita
Yo soy amoroso
What could be wrong with the hombre who sings so low?
From up in Californi-o?You might also likeEmbed
