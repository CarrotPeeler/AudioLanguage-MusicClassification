1 ContributorSkin Deep LyricsSpeak now or forever hold your frown
Jesus you were frowning before I was born
And you don't have to say a word chaffing in your cocoon
Well I want to know what's inside you
False face you won't be remembered as anything else
It's a bare place and you're more than skin deep
Beauty is poetry poetry is lonely simplicity it is beauty
Beauty is more than skin deep
The tragedy of the tragic is they can never be majestic
No indeed show me something that I can see
And show yourself something that resembles self resembles self
Skin deep beauty is poetry poetry is lonely simplicity is beauty
Beauty is more than skin deep and you don't have to say a word
Well I want to know what's inside you and you don't have to say a word
And show me something I can see well you don't have to say a word
Well you don't have to say a wordYou might also likeEmbed
