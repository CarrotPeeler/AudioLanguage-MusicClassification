6 ContributorsAs Youâ€™re Falling Down Lyrics

As you're falling down
(As you're falling down)
My heart beats the same
(Beats the same)
And the tears now
(And the tears now)
Run down your face

If you had class you'd throw down with me
Drown in your fake personality
Shattered glass and frames
(Shattered glass and frames)
Snapshots of reality
Burnt pictures and memories
Your heart's cold and grey

To whom it may concern
(You stayed the same, you stayed the same
You stayed the same)
I'm the same
And all that I've learned
(You stayed the same, you stayed the same
You stayed the same)
Has faded away
You might also like
Can you tell me
(All the lies that you have said)
All the lies that you have said?
So keep on lying
(Just keep on lying to me)
I find less beauty in life than death

If you had class you'd throw down with me
Drown in your fake personality
Shattered glass and frames
(Shattered glass and frames)
Snapshots of reality
Burnt pictures and memories
Your heart's cold and grey

To whom it may concern
(You stayed the same, you stayed the same
You stayed the same)
I'm the same
And all that I've learned
(You stayed the same, you stayed the same
You stayed the same)
Has faded away
I know that the blood still stains
And I don't feel the same
Go!
As you're falling down
(As you're falling down)
My heart beats the same
And the tears now (tears now)
(And the tears now)
Run down your face

To whom it may concern
(You stayed the same, you stayed the same
You stayed the same)
I'm the same
And all that I've learned
(You stayed the same, you stayed the same
You stayed the same)
Has faded away

To whom it may concern
(Can you tell me?)
I'm the same
And all that I've learned
(As you're falling down)
Has faded away
