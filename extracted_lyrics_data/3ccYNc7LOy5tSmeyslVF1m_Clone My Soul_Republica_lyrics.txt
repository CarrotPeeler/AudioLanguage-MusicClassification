1 ContributorClone My Soul Lyrics
One life, one chance
Play god for body parts
What size and color
Don't it look like mother
One me, one you
Four eyes of baby blue
Its final will men fade
Don't you look pretty over my dead body

You can't clone my soul
You can't clone my soul
Till my heart stops beating
Don't let go!

One life, one chance
Play god for body parts
Big lord is watching
Over hell's kitchen

You can't clone my soul
You can't clone my soul
Till my heart stops beating
Don't let go!
You can't clone my soul
You can't clone my soul
Till my heart stops beating
Don't let go!

No don't let go

Don't let go
