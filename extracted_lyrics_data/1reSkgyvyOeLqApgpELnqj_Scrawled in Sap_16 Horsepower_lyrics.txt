4 ContributorsScrawled In Sap LyricsO the sky grey orange
An' the walls stained blue
An' I laid right down on the golden satin with you
Into sween dark circles of beautiful eyes
I go round
Oh Lord
I go round
Will you tell me once again
Cream white skin
You are my friend
I seen you walking
An' your white hips sway
Oh girl, I will have you no more
To the moan in your voice
Not a charm do you lack
Your skin to touch as a black ravens back
But I cannot go far with these words as they rhyme
As to tell, of the pleasure
Your hand in mine
An' I pray as I say this song in this way
That your eyes, they would close
An' your head begin to sway
An' you'll feel how he heals
With his blood on our skin
I am yours lady scrawled an' thin
You might also likeWill you tell me once again
Cream white skin
You are my friend
I seen you walking in your husband's way
Girl I will have you more
Oh, the sky grey orange
An' the walls stained blue
An' I laid right down on the golden satin with you
Into sween dark circles of beautiful eyes
I go round
Oh Lord
I go roundEmbed
