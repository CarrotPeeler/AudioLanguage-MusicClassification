Yeah, yeah

Don't want to wait till you know me better
Let's just be glad for the time together
Life's such a treat, and it's time you taste it
There isn't a reason on earth to waste it
It ain't a crime to be good to yourself

(Lick it up, lick it up, oh) It's only right now
(Lick it up, lick it up, oh) Whoo, yeah
(Lick it up, lick it up, oh) Come on, come on
(Lick it up, lick it up, oh) Ooh

Don't need to wait for an invitation
You gotta live like you're on vacation
There's something sweet you can't buy with money
(Lick it up) Whoo (Lick it up)
It's all you need, so believe me, honey
It ain't a crime to be good to yourself

(Lick it up, lick it up, oh) It's only right now
(Lick it up, lick it up, oh) Whoo, yeah
(Lick it up, lick it up, oh) Come on, come on
(Lick it up, lick it up, oh) Come on

Ooh yeah (Ooh yeah), ooh yeah (Ooh yeah)
Yeah yeah

Oh, whoo

(Lick it up, lick it up, oh) It's only right now
(Lick it up, lick it up, oh) Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(Lick it up, lick it up, oh) Come on, come on

(Lick it up, lick it up, oh) Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
