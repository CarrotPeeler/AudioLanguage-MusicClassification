4 ContributorsI Wanna Be Free Lyrics
All my life
I've followed signs
On many a road
Tried to find
What was right
And do what I'm told
But sometimes
You cross the line
And never can go back home
I've been here
And I've been there
Always on the go
Looking for
Something more
To call my own
Up to now
I have found
That life as a whole was cold
Because I've never belonged

I want to be free
And live without warning
I want to finally see
What it's like on the other side
I want to be free
Because a new day is dawning
I want to be me
I want to show the world I'm alive

Who's to say
I need change
And I am not what I'm not
Look at me
And what you see
Has been through a lot
Now it's time
For me to find
What love's really all about
And all that I've lived without
