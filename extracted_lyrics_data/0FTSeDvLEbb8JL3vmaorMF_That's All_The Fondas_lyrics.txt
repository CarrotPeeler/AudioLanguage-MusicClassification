An acid is monobasic, dibasic, or tribasic
According to the number of replaceable hydrogen atoms
Thus HNO3 is monobasic—

Book two of "The Odyssey" (H2SO4 is dibasic)
Where we left off yesterday (H3PO2 is tribasic—)
Mr. Taylor?

Dear Joe
Hazel and Bob have the cutest white stucco house
They're living together there like two lovebirds
The lucky bums—

Mr. Taylor!

Uh, "Thus did Telemachus invoke Zeus
And the all powerful answering his prayer
Sent forth two eagles from his mountain
Swift as thе wind of a storm they flew
Wing tip to wing—"
You might also like
She is nеver away
From her home in your heart
In your heart every day
She is playing her part

All living matter proceeds from pre-existing living matter
The new form takes on the character of that from which it came—

Hazel is going to have a baby!
How I envy her
That's all the news
Fondly, Jennie

The aim of philosophy is to exhibit the universe
As a rational system in the harmony of its parts

Dear Joe
Popper is taking me to Europe!
He wants me to meet new friends

New friends?
Get that, Joe?
Her father wants her to find a husband
Some lousy nobleman, perhaps!

A molecule is the smallest part of a substance which can exist alone—

Alone

You'll never get her back
Think of the men she'll meet on the steamer
And when she gets to England, and Paris!

I met a charming boy named Bertram Woolhaven!

She wants to get married

She's tired of waiting for you

Damn her
Damn her!
Bertram's father is in the coal and lumber business, too

That's the end, Joe
An alliance between two big lumber families
It's the handwriting on the wall

"Unclasps her warmed jewels one by one
Loosens her fragrant bodice—

—By degrees
Her rich attire creeps rustling to her knees
Half-hidden like a mermaid in seaweed
Pensive awhile, she dreams awake, and sees
In fancy, fair St. Agnes in her bed
But dares not look behind
Or all the charm is fled"

The pragmatic philosopher searches for the hypothesis
Which can best serve him

Philosophy, hell!
You'll never drive her out of your mind

In your heart every day
She is playing her part

Bertram's teaching me to swim
We're learning a new stroke

She is never away
And you'll never be free

The Greek philosophers finally rebelled against fatalism
We need not be dominated, they said

We need not submit, Joe

We need not be dominated

To hell with her

Lots of good fish in the sea

Charlie, did you say that girlfriend of yours had a sister?

Ha! I'll say she has

Then get her!
I'm on the loose!Embed
