5 ContributorsThatâ€™s Your Business LyricsIf you glad that you've got nothing to say
If you glad that you've nowhere to pray
Oh, baby, that's your business now
If you glad that you've got nothing to do
Don't you know I depend on you
Hey, baby, that's your business now
When it's all over and you're lying in
And then you start to feel
Don't feel uneasy, just give her a knee
She's just some woman trying to get some speed, yeah
If you glad that you've got nothing to feel
If you glad that so real
Hey, baby, somebody shine on me
Lay down
Back into bridge
When that's all over and you're sitting it your
That sweet old above
Oh, don't feel uneasy, just give her a knee
Just some woman trying to get some speed, Lord
If you glad that you've got nothing to hide
If you glad that you've got nothing to
Hey, baby, that's your business now
You might also likeIf you glad that you've got nowhere to weep
If you glad that you've got nothing to
Hey, sweetie, that's your business now
If you glad
Oh, if you glad
Don't feel bad
If you glad
Oh, if you glad
If you glad than don't feel bad
