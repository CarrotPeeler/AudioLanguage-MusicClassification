3 ContributorsKeep on Looking LyricsOnce I had a good man
Once a good man, he had me
A happy do right good man
Made me sing sweet melodies
Happiness was around me
You know I had to mine twice
No sorrow will surround me
Once a good man you know he did me right
Treated me good, made me happy
But then one day he left me
There's something I must confess
When he left, I was in a mess
Ooh, let me testify, let me rectify
And explain how he did me wrong
Ooh, he left me all alone
Whoa one day that good man was gone
Whoa he left me all alone
Is there such a thing as true love
Between a woman and a man?
I guess I got to keep on searchin', yeah
Ima keep on searchin' till I find that love again
You might also likeI got to keep on lookin
I'm gonna look high
I'm gonna look low
Everywhere I go, got to keep on lookin'
Hey, for that true love again
Let me find that true love again
Break it down, break it down
Gonna keep on lookin'...for that true love againEmbed
