A long time passing
Where have all the flowers gone?
A long ago
Where have all the flowers gone?
Girl, they've picked up every one
When will they ever learn?
When will they ever learn?
Where have all the soldiers gone?
Long time passing
Where have all the soldiers gone?
Long ago
Where have all the soldiers gone?
They've gone to graveyards every one
When will they ever learn?
When will they ever learn?
When will they learn, ever learn?
When will they learn?
When will they learn, ever learn?
Ever learn?
When will they ever learn?
When will they ever learn?

You don't know what we're talkin' about
When we say there's
There's too many starvin' children
And you don't know what we're talkin' about
When we say we're killing each other
And we just ain't got time for ya brother
No, no, hey, hey
You don't know what we're talkin' about
When we say we're livin' in the last days and timeEmbed
