1 ContributorAddicted LyricsYou know what I need
You know what I want
Play this game with me
Play this game with me
You know what I did
You know what I want
Play this game with me
Play this game with me
Give me what I need
Give me what I want
Play, play this game with me
Play this game with me
I'm addicted to the things you give me
I want them every night
I love your body, I love your skin
I know what we do is right
Come and give me what I need
Come and give it to me now
You know you got me under control
But I like it somehowYou might also likeEmbed
