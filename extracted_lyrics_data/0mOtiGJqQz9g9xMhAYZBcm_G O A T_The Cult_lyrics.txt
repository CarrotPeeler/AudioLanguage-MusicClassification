3 ContributorsG O A T Lyrics
And the blood rises up
And the blood rises up
And the blood rises up
And the blood rises up
To the roof
Watch the bodies hit the ground
Watch the bodies hit the ground
Watch them fall
Watch them fall

They don’t even know that they’re dead
The don’t even know that they’re wrong
Singing all alone in your head
They don’t even know that they’re gone

The greatest of all time
The greatest of all time
The greatest of all time
The greatest of all time kill
And the blood rises up
And the blood rises up
To the roof
Bitch like you
Watch the bodies hit the ground
Well hey watch the bodies hit the ground
Well let body rule sacrifice you

They don’t even know that they’re dead
While you’re singing all alone in your head
They don’t even know baby that they’re gone
They don’t even know that they’re wrong

The greatest of all time
The greatest of all time
The greatest of all time
The greatest of all time kill

Knock them down
Knock them down
Knock them down
Knock them down
Knock them down
Knock them down
Knock them down
Knock them downEmbed
