There goes my dignity, yeah yeah
You're just no good for me
But baby I know
The victory's mine, whoa-oh
Here comes Napoleon
All dressed up to the nines, yeah yeah
Mouth working overtime
Trying to explain
Stop wasting my time, whoa-oh
And I try to fight it, try to deny it
But somehow your itchy finger pulls on my trigger, yeah
Like some creature in some B-feature
You're creeping in the hero's bed
But you'll never crawl inside my head, yeah yeah yeah
Here comes Napoleon
(Here comes Napoleon)
All dressed up to the nines, yeah yeah
(All dressed up to the nines)
Mouth working overtime
Trying to explain
Stop wasting my time, whoa-oh
The victory's mine
You might also likeYou street walker, you
You sweet talker, you
You slide like a politician around the truth
You're so stupid, and I'm so stupid
It seems the only common ground
Since I broke those chains
That dragged me down...
Down...
You drag me down...
You drag me down, yeah yeah yeah
Here comes Napoleon
There goes my dignity, yeah yeah
You're just no good for me
But baby I know
The victory's mine, whoa-oh
Here comes Napoleon
All dressed up to the nines
Mouth working overtime
You ain't no friend of mine
Here comes Napoleon
There goes my dignity
You're just no good for me
You're an apology
Here comes Napoleon...
Here comes Napoleon...
Here he comes now...Embed
