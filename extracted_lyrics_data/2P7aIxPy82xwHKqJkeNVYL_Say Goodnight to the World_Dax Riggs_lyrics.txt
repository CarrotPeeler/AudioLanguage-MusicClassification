3 ContributorsSay Goodnight to the World LyricsAll these stars
You've been reachin' after, oh, oh
Weepin' with laughter
Oh, weepin' with laughter
I could disappear
Live only in your tears
Just you whisper in my ear
And say goodnight to the world
Aye, aye, aye, aye
This is the way
That the sorcerers say
They say goodnight
Say goodnight to the world
Aye, aye, aye, aye
Say goodnight to the world
Say goodnight to the world
Yeah
Say goodnight to the world
Say goodnight to the world
Say goodnight to the world
Say goodnight to the world
Yeah
Say goodnight to the world
Say goodnight to the worldYou might also likeEmbed
