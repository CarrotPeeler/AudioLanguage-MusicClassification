1 ContributorNever Be You LyricsI, I don't know what I should do coz the longer I go
The more that I know I'm chasin shadows with you
And she is as sweet as she can be
She's a real bombshell we get along well
But something is incomplete
Somethins not right but nothins really wrong
In my heart I can tell that I'm stringin her along
Tell me what should I do baby I hope your missin me to
(Chorus:)
Coz I can try, I can try but I know I'll never
I know I'll never fall or give her my all
Coz she'll never be you
And I can lie, I can lie and tell you that she's better
But I'll always compare as long as I am aware
That she'll never be you
She'll never be no, she'll never be
She'll never be no, she'll never be
She'll never be no, she will never be you
I know, yes I know it's far from fair
How I bought her perfume, the dress and the shoes
The same that you used to wear
If I can't get u off my mind I gotta let the girl go
It's wrong and I know I'm only wasting her time
You might also likeSomethins' not right but nothins really wrong
In my heart I can tell that I'm stringin' her along
Tell me what should I do baby
I hope your missin' me to
(Repeat Chorus:)
She'll never be no, she'll never be
She'll never be no, she'll never be
She'll never be no she will never be you
The harder I try the harder it seems
And she would be perfect if she was in someone else's dreams
So we sleep alone baby even when we sleep together
(Repeat Chorus: (2x))
She'll never be no, she'll never be
She'll never be no, she'll never be
She'll never be no she will never be youEmbed
