This Earth speaks of darkness
To come in the blood of man
The air, breathe the poison
All water running black
Until the sun rises and sets on death
The sky burns red like sheer hate
The light in our eyes will fade
To join the darkness of our souls

The Earth is losing its light
Night falls fast
Watch the dying sun
We're lost

No angel dares to land
In this hell of mankind's making
Buried all beauty in our foulness
Nature begins to shine its fury
Until the sun rises and sets on death
The sky burns red like sheer hate

The Earth is losing its light
Night falls fast
Watch the dying sun

Pray for the dead


The sky burns red
Like sheer hate

The Earth is losing its light
Night falls fast
Watch the dying sun
We're lostEmbed
