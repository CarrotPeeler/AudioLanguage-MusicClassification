I want God to come and take me home
'Cause I'm all alone in this crowd
Who are you to me? Who am I supposed to be?
Not exactly sure anymore, mmm
Where's this going to? Can I follow through?
Or just follow you for a while?

Does anyone ever get this right?
I feel no love

Ain't no confusion here, it is as I've feared
The illusion that you feel is real
To be vulnerable is needed most of all
If you intend to truly fall apart

You think the worst of all is far behind
The vampire of time and memories
Has died, I survived
I speak, I breathe, I'm incomplete
I'm alive, hooray
You're wrong again, 'cause I feel no love

Does anyone ever get this right?
I feel no love
I feel no love17Embed
