3 ContributorsWalkin’ on Air LyricsYesterday
I had a wonderful time
It passed away
And left a blue heart of mine
It's pretty rare
That it’s comin' all over me
Like walkin' on air
From a river deep
On a mountain high
Like a sunray
Through a cloudy sky
I slip away
And it’s comin' all over me
Like walkin' on air, walkin' on air
Keep walkin' on air
Save your despair
Walkin' around
Ain't touching the ground
Don't care to much
’Cause livin’ is there
For walkin' on air
Hey blue moon
Why don’t you let me be
I don't know why
You keep on haunting me
I wouldn't care
Should I never
Feel blue again
Better walkin' on air, walkin’ on air
Keep walkin' on air…You might also likeEmbed
