4 ContributorsLonely Highway Lyrics
I'm never going back to Jackson
I couldn't bear to show my face
I nearly killed you with my drinking
Wouldn't be caught dead in that place

Lonely highway, only friend
You've got me to keep you warm again
Lonely highway, don't you cry
Let me hold you in my arms tonight

And as I hurtle down the highway
Past the factories and the graves
I think of all the years I've wasted
I think of all the years I've saved

Lonely highway, only friend
You've got me to keep you warm again
Lonely highway, don't you cry
Let me hold you in my arms tonightSee The Magnetic Fields LiveGet tickets as low as $69You might also likeEmbed
