3 ContributorsNeed You Forever Lyrics
Today we're friends
Oh, but tomorrow
We could be lovers, baby
You see, it happened yesterday
You thought I wanted to play
But girl, I wanna stay
Right here with you

You say you wanna know
You wanna know, you wanna know
If I really love you, baby
You see, you mean more to me
I'm chained and I can't break free
Your love has a hold, a hold on me

You see that I need you forever
I need you forever
I need you forever
Starting right now

You oughta understand
That I ain't playing with you, woman
I'm for real, girl
This time I'm for real, baby
You see, it happened yesterday
When you kissed me that way
Not another day, baby, not another day
Can I spend without you
You might also like
I need you forever
I need you forever
I need you forever
Starting right now
I need you forever
I need you forever
I need you forever
Starting right now
I need you forever
I need you forever
I need you forever
Starting right now
I need you forever
I need you forever
I need you forever
Starting right now


You see, you mean more to me
I'm chained and I can't break free
Your love has a hold
You got a hold on me
You see that I need you forever
I need you forever
I need you forever
Starting right now

I need you forever
I need you forever
I need you foreverEmbed
