Whiskey ghost, just won't let me be
Killed him a long time ago, but he's still after me
Hold on that bottle, laid it in a grave
Paid my last respect and I walked away
But I still can feel him in the dead of the night
He hate to see a good man trying to do right
Whiskey ghost, just keep on haunting me
Killed him a long time ago, but he's still after me
He's out there tonight in some low down dive
Waiting in the shadows, the same old lie
Might be Jack Black, might be Jim Beam
Smiling in the corner sayin', "The first one's on me"
Whiskey ghost, keep on haunting me
Killed him a long time ago, but he's still won't let me be
In the middle of the night I feel the chill
Reach down against my will
I smell the taste and I start to scream
Scared the hell right out of me
Whiskey ghost, keep on haunting me
Killed him a long time ago, but he's still after me
He's still after me
That old whiskey ghost
That whiskey ghostYou might also likeEmbed
