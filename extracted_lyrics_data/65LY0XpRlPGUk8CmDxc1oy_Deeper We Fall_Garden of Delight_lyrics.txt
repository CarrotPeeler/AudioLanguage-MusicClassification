1 ContributorDeeper We Fall LyricsUnholy shadows once broken
So quietly she lays upon her bed
Deeper we fall
The world begins to sleep
Deeper and deeper
Upon her bed
Drifting around in forbidden dimensions
Re-enter the lifeless body upon her bed
No longer vision
I´ll wait for sleep
Our souls are one
Let us dream
Once
Faithful
Gone
Fallen
I´ll wait for sleep
We fell from grace
Lost our sons
Memories of long forgotten days
I´ll wait so quietly
Upon her bed
So quietly
Upon the dead
Once
Faithful
Gone
Fallen
I´ll wait for sleepYou might also likeEmbed
