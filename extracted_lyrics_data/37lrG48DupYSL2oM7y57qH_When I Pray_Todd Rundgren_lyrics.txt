3 ContributorsWhen I Pray Lyrics
Now I lay me down to sleep
I'm praying Lord my soul to keep
If I die before I wake
Somebody made a big mistake
I'm only just one little man
Just using up the air
Still I'm asking anyway

Lord when I pray, please be there
Lord when I pray, please be there
Singing om om my god, please be there

You know I'm just like all my kind
I got a weak and confused mind
When I feel a little pain
You know how I love to complain
But I try to be strong
I try hard to lift my share
I don't expect for nothing

But Lord when I pray, please be there
Lord when I pray, please be there
Now I sing for you
You might also like

Please be there, Lord when I pray
Please be there, Lord when I pray
Please be there
Singing om om my god, please be thereEmbed
