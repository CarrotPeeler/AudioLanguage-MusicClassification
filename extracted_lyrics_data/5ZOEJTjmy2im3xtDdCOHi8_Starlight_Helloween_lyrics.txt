Oh, shit

You're hangin' around and got nothin' to do
You wanna get out some pills in front of you
You fly on invisible wings
Be careful, my friend, for too many can kill
You say that the meaning of life's in those pills
You forget all earthly things
See Helloween LiveGet tickets as low as $65You might also like
You swallow your pill; you wanna feel free
A trip to a world made of games
You do it again, yet it's never the same
But a junkie's not something to be

Starlight fallin' in deep through your eyes
Starlight shinin' down for your soul to rise

Now there's a needle lying in front of you
I'm frightened of those things
But I know what you'll do
You need it to escape from the night, ha-ha
You ride on through heaven; you don't feel no pain
You ride on and ride on again and again
On the needle that brings you the light

You feel the mind-blowin' stuff
Flow through your veins
You take off and fly to the sun
But when you get to near, your wings will be burnt
You'll die in the flames and you'll fall
Starlight fallin' in deep through your eyes
Starlight shinin' down for your soul to rise


You feel the mind-blowin' stuff
Flow through your veins
You take off and fly to the sun
But when you get to near, your wings will be burnt
You'll die in the flames and you'll fall

Starlight fallin' in deep through your eyes
Starlight shinin' down for your soul to rise

Starlight fallin' in deep through your eyes
Starlight shinin' down for your soul to riseEmbed
