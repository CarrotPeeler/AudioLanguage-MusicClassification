8 ContributorsLove at War LyricsThey gave their selves to the streets, they saved
They took the challenge to keep our faith
They gave their selves to the streets, they saved
They took the challenge to keep our faith
We can't imagine the way, we can't imagine the day
They put their hate in the waves, they put their heart in the way
They gave their selves to the streets, they saved
They fought to keep our faith
Cut their life away from safe, to save
Leave the blind alone in the reign
But I know I couldn't be taught to die with pride, for queen or country
I know I couldn't be taught to die, not another slave to the hive, not another slave to the hive
I've seen the names, I'm not young and afraid, the numbers the same
They could decide when we die but we decide what we defend
We sing the sorrow of the dead from our souls
And hope that they found peace, dying alone
We sing the sorrow of the dead from our souls
And hope that they found peace, dying alone
Cut their life away from safe, to save
The mindless freedom puts our nation to shame
Are you grateful of the graves?

If we suffered for this, I has to change
They gave their selves to the streets, they saved
They took the challenge to keep our faith
They gave their selves to the streets, they saved
They took the challenge to keep our faith
Carry on, carry on
Carry on, carry on
Carry on, carry on
Carry on, carry onEmbed
