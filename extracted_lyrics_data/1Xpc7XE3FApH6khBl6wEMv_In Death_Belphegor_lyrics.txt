1 ContributorIn Death LyricsCruelty is, your life that binds
Insanity is, your flesh that blinds
Mighty is, your teacher, this pain
Your prison, your wish to attain
Burn my moral restriction
Beyond excruciating constriction
Beyond the flesh, to wander free
Beyond the flesh, the soul of me
A cruel master, I hearken unto thee
Disease and suffering, shall set you free
Let death dance as a knife
The steps in time, to bleeding strife
Burn my moral restriction
Beyond excruciating constriction
Beyond the flesh, to wander free
Beyond the flesh, the soul of me

Burn my moral restriction
Beyond excruciating constriction
Beyond the flesh, to wander free
Beyond the flesh, the soul of me
In death!You might also likeEmbed
