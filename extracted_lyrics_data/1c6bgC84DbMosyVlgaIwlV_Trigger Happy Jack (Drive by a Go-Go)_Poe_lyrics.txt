He scares easily
It makes him so angry at me
And his head, it spins around just like the Exorcist, and I
Find it ever so hard to resist his cries
But there's nothing more sadistic than an infant
Waving his pistol in my face
He wants me right down on my knees
Crumbling in disgrace
But he underestimates my mind
I know he's messing with my head
My only weakness is
I can't believe the guy could be entirely dead

Can't talk to a psycho like a normal human being
Can't talk to a psycho like a normal human being
Trigger Happy Jack, you're gonna blow
But I'm gonna get off before you go
My Trigger Happy Jack is just a
Drive by a go-go
Go-go

And after awhile he calms down
And he looks at me like a prince
But I know I better bite the bullet
'cause it's just another one of his Jedi mind tricks
But this ain't no headtrip honey
This is a collision on the road
And you've got me feeling oh just like a roadkill
And you know deep down I know
You might also like
Can't talk to a psycho like a normal human being
Can't talk to a psycho like a normal human being
Trigger Happy Jack, you're gonna blow
But I'm gonna get off before you go
My Trigger Happy Jack is just a
Drive by a go-go

Why do you make me feel like this? (1-2-3-4)
Why do you gotta be such a dick? (1-2-3-4)
Why do you make me feel like this? (1-2-3-4)
Why do you gotta be such a dick? (1-2-3-4)
(I'm feeling sick) Go-go

And I hate myself just enough to want him
But I hate him just enough to get off
But I understand him, maybe I'm just crazy enough
To love him, why not? (Why not?)

You can't talk to a psycho like a normal human being
Can't talk to a psycho like a normal human being
Can't talk to a psycho like a normal human being
Can't talk to a psycho like a normal human being
You can't talk to a psycho like a normal human beingEmbed
