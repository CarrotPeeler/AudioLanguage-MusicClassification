2 ContributorsSnail LyricsDon’t ask me again, what I’ve been doing
You know too well, you know too well
The thing that might surprise you even now is how
I’ve desensitized, I’ve specialized
What I did was make for me a special place
Of disassociated perfect peace
I find it suits my moods and needs so very well
What I became, what I became
There is no match, there’s nothing you can say
To change my mind, to change my mind
What I did was make for me a special place
You’ve lost me now, you’ve lost me now
The disassociated peace you knew so well
Is in this shell, in this shell
What I did was make for me a special place
Of disassociated perfect peace
I find it suits my moods and needs so very well
What I became, what I becameYou might also likeEmbed
