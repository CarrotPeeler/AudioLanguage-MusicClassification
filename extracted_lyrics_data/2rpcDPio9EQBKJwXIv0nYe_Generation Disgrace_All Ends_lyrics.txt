2 ContributorsGeneration Disgrace LyricsSame dress — the world rages..
A 2-minute-fuck gets you 3 in
The spotlight — yeah..
A white dollar-bill and a lame rhyme..
- That's how you get your hot spot
On prime time..
People just don't give a damn!
Shut up! (shut up)
Common equals losers and
All around the world our generation
Is completely fucked up!
(Shut up)
Publicity is all that counts
Unless you find a way to gain some more
- Our generations' disgrace!
Big lips and fake tits..
White gold in your pocket
A rolex to show off
- Let's hijack a limo, the chicks'll
Dig it!
Cut off a bottle, luxury's total!
People just don't give a damn!

Common equals losers and
All around the world our generation
Is completely fucked up!
(Shut up)
Publicity is all that counts
Unless you find a way to gain some more
- Our generations' disgrace!
Gold-diggers and fake figures
Money's all that matters now
That common sense is out
Bad bidders and low figures
It's time to stand up and say
Shut up! (shut up)
Common equals losers and
All around the world our generation
Is completely fucked up!
(Shut up)
Publicity is all that counts
Unless you find a way to gain some more
- Our generations' disgrace!
Common equals losers and
All around the world our generation
Is completely fucked up!
(Shut up)
Publicity is all that counts
Unless you find a way to gain some more
- Our generations' disgrace!Embed
