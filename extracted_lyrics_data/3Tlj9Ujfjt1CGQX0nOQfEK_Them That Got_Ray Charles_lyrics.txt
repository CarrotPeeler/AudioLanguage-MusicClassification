5 ContributorsThem That Got Lyrics
I've gotten down to my last pair of shoes
Can't even win a nickel bet
Because, ah, them that's got are them that gets
And I ain't got nothing yet

I'm sneaking in and out ducking my landlord
All I seem to do is stay in debt
Because, ah, them that's got, yeah, are them that gets
And I tell you all I ain't got nothing yet

That old saying them that's got are them that gets
Is something I can't see
If you gotta have something
Before you can get something
How do you get your first is still a mystery to me
I see folk with long cars and fine clothes
That's why they're called the smarter set
Because they manage to get
When only them that's got supposed to get
And I ain't got nothing yet

That old saying them that's got are them that gets
Is something I can't see
If you gotta have something
Before you can get something
How do you get your first is still a mystery to me
I see folk with long cars and fine clothes
That's why they're called the smarter set
Because they manage to get
Oh, when only them that's got supposed to get
And I ain't got nothing yet
Woah, I tell you all I ain't found nothing yet
You might also like
You know I just don't understand it
I can't seem to get a nickel or a dime for a cup of coffee
I need a hamburger, in fact a hot dog wouldn't be too bad
I would just be grateful if I could get my hands on most anything right nowEmbed
