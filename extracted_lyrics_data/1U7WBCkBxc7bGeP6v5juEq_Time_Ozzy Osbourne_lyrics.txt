5 ContributorsTime Lyrics
The time has come for you to make up your own mind
Stop looking for the answers that you'll never find
Save all your tears for when you really need to cry
Don't wish your life away to spread your wings and fly

Time waits for no one, yeah
It's never what it seems
Stop waiting for tomorrow
Stop living in your dreams

This life fading away
This life ticking like a time bomb ready to blow your tortured mind
I know it's wasting away
We don't plan for when it goes wrong
The time that we lose, we will never find time

Can't hide the clock when every line shows on your face
So take it slow, you'll never win the human race

Time waits for no one, yeah
Everything must change
Stop running to the future
Start living for today
You might also like
This life fading away
This life ticking like a time bomb ready to blow your tortured mind
I know it's wasting away
We don't plan for when it goes wrong
The time that we lose, we will never find time


Just live every moment of each day
'Cause death is the price we all must pay

This life fading away
This life ticking like a time bomb ready to blow your tortured mind
I know it's wasting away
We don't plan for when it goes wrong
The time that we lose, we will never find time
This life fading away
This life ticking like a time bomb ready to blow your tortured mind
I know it's wasting away
We don't plan for when it goes wrong
The time that we lose, we will never find timeEmbed
