6 ContributorsUgly Lyrics
The sun is up and I'm coming down
It's been a while but I'm burning out
Flippin' my fingers on the 5-inch screen
Novocaine pictures, comfortably numb to the scene

Tap it twice if you like it
Tap it twice if you like it
Think twice, you may not like it
Like it or not (whoa, oh)

I'll let you see the good if you know me
I'll show you all the bad if you love me
But, oh, oh, only I know the ugly
I'll let you see the good if you know me
I'll show you all the bad if you love me
But, oh, oh, only I know the ugly

La-la-la-la-la, la, la, la
La-la-la-la-la, la, la, la (ugly)

Fractured mirrors and broken scales
Makes me tip back when I inhale
Flying dishes turn to falling tears, all you see
Novocaine pictures, selfies with my teddy bear
You might also like
Tap it twice if you like it
Tap it twice if you like it
Think twice, you may not like it
Like it or not (whoa, oh)

I'll let you see the good if you know me
I'll show you all the bad if you love me
But, oh, oh, only I know the ugly
I'll let you see the good if you know me
I'll show you all the bad if you love me
But, oh, oh, only I know the ugly

La-la-la-la-la, la, la, la
La-la-la-la-la, la, la, la (ugly)

I paint pretty on my face
But I'll fight, I'll scream, I'll misbehave
Got secrets you won't see on stage
And that's what you call beautiful
I paint pretty on my face
But I'll fight, I'll scream, I'll misbehave
Got secrets you won't see on stage
And that's what you call beautiful
I'll let you see the good if you know me
I'll show you all the bad if you love me
But, oh, oh, only I know the ugly
I'll let you see the good if you know me
I'll show you all the bad if you love me
But, oh, oh, only I know the ugly

La-la-la-la-la, la, la, la
La-la-la-la-la, la, la, la (ugly)1Embed
