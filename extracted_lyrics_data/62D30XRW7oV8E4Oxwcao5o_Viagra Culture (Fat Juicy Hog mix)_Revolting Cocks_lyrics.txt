And it is us!
(This is what you get)
(This is what you get)
(This is what you get)
Ah, nothing is ever enough
(This is what you get)
Ah, nothing is ever enough
(This is what you- This is what you get)
(You take the blue pill, you wake up on your bed)
(And I show you how deep the rabbit hole goes)
This is the U.S.A.!
We get bored when we can't get stuff
This is the U.S.A.!
This is the U.S.A.!
What's so bad about the fall of Rome
When we're the ones who got all the gold?
Never share anything with anyone else
Or you're a bunch of girlie men!
(This is what you get)
(This is what you get)

This is how life must be
To keep the sheep asleep!
To keep the sheep asleep!
(This is what you get)
(This is what you get)
I must win
My money must win!
My wiener must win!

Again, again
I must win!
Again, again
