1 ContributorThereâ€™s A Bright Side Somewhere Lyrics
Well there's a bright side somewhere
There's a bright side somewhere
Now I ain't gonna rest until I find it
There's a bright side somewhere

And there's more love somewhere
And there's more peace somewhere
I ain't gonna rest until I find it
There's a bright side somewhere

People got a good job somewhere
Got a lot of good friends somewhere
Got a little suitcase, got a little family
Over on the bright side somewhereYou might also likeEmbed
