20 ContributorsHead Lyrics
I remember when I met you, baby
You were on your way to be wed
You were such a sexy thing
I loved the way you walked, the things you said
I was so nonchalant
I didn't want you to be misled
But I've got to have you, baby
I got to have you in my bed
You said:
"I'm just a virgin, and I'm
On my way to be wed
You're such a hunk
So full of spunk"

I'll give you head 'til you're burning up
Head 'til you get enough
Head 'til your love is red
Head, love you 'til you're dead

You know you're good, girl
I think you like to go down
You wouldn't have stopped
But, uh, I came on your wedding gown
You said:
"I must confess
I wanna get undressed and go to bed"
With that, I jammed, you fool
You married me instead
You might also like
Now morning, noon, and night
I give you head 'til you're burning up
Head 'til you get enough
Head 'til your love is red
Head, love you 'til you're dead, oh

Ooh, yeah
Ooh, yeah
Ooh, yeah
Head
Head
Head
Head
Woah


Head 'til you're burning up
Head 'til you get enough
Head 'til your love is red
Head, love you 'til you're dead

(I know)
Head

(I know)
Head
(Baby)
Head
Head
(Ooh)

(Ooo)
