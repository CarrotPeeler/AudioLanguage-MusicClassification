We didn't have much idea
Of the kind of climate waiting
We used our hands for guidance
Like the children of a preacher
Like a dry tree seeking water
Or a daughter
Nice 'n' sleazy
Nice 'n' sleazy does it
Nice 'n' sleazy, nice 'n' sleazy
Does it, does it, does it every time
Nice 'n' sleazy, nice 'n' sleazy
Does it, does it, does it every time
Nice 'n' sleazy does it
Nice 'n' sleazy, nice 'n' sleazy
Does it, does it, does it every time
Nice 'n' sleazy, nice 'n' sleazy
Does it, does it, does it every time
Nice 'n' sleazy does it
An angel came from outside
Had no halo, had no father
With a coat of many colours
He spoke of brothers many
Wine and women, song a plenty
He began to write a chapter
In history
Nice 'n' sleazy
Nice 'n' sleazy does it
Nice 'n' sleazy does it
Nice 'n' sleazy does it
Does it every timeSee The Stranglers LiveGet tickets as low as $92You might also likeEmbed
