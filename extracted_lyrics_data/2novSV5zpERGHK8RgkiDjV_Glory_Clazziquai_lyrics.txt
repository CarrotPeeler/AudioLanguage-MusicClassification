1 ContributorGlory Lyrics
We’ve got started
What’re ya ‘fraid of?
You’ve been living in superstition
For all this time

By now, we should know
How to communicate
Instead of coming to an end that
We know it’s all wrong
We can’t get no satisfaction
Like we used to

Come fly with me
There is so much new to see
I’ll have you see things
In your imagination
Let it fly with me
It’s alright with me
This song below, oh

I’ve been telling
There’s no one above you
You’ve been living
In your ideal nation
For all this time
You might also like
By now, we should know
How to communicate
Instead of coming to an end that
We know it’s all wrong
We can’t get no satisfaction
Like we used to

Come fly with me
There is so much new to see
I’ll have you see things
In your imagination
Let it fly with me
It’s alright with me
This song below

Come fly with me
There’s something new
For you to see
I’ll have you see things
In our imagination
Let it fly with me
It’s alright with me
This song below, oh
Come on, get up
Let’s do something
It’s like the song that
You’ve been waiting
For all this time
For all this time

Come on, get up
Let’s do something
It’s like the song that
I’ve been singing
For all this time
For all this time

Come fly with me
There is so much new to see
I’ll have you see things
In your imagination
Let it fly with me
It’s alright with me
This song below

Come fly with me
There’s something new
For you to see
I’ll have you see things
In our imagination
Let it fly with me
It’s alright with me
This song below, oh
You may say that
We don’t even know
How to make things change
But come and fly with me
Come and fly with me

You may say that
We don’t even know
How to make things change
But come and fly with me
Come and fly with meEmbed
