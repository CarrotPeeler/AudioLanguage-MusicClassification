12 ContributorsBeauty in Tragedy Lyrics
There is beauty, in tragedy
The heart will stop beating
But the end is a new beginning
We'll soar above the skyline of reality
And reach towards a love ever after
As we're grasping onto faith
To keep us breathing, a little longer, a little longer
For just one moment, with one another, with one another
This night is pulling on my heart's strings

These feelings bring tears to my eyes!
To see you leave my world, leave my side!
Hear the angels sing!
As they embrace you with a warm; "Welcome home!"
With a warm "Welcome home!"
Hear the angels sing!
Hear the angels sing!

Tomorrow, the air will be a little colder
But I'll be sure to breathe for the both of us
And the nights, may be a little darker
But I'll be sure to carry the torch to warm the hearts
That never got to feel yours
I can't hear your voice, I can't hear your voice
But that's okay, cause I can feel you in my heart
I can't hear your voice, I can't hear your voice
But that's okay, cause I can feel you in my heart
You might also like
One morning I'll wake up to you
One morning I'll hear the angels sing
On that morning, we won't be worried about the weather
Nor will we, mind, where the hands lay, on the clock tower

I'll be sure to write your name in the sand
Where the waves can't wash it away
I'll be sure to write your name in the sand
Where the waves can't wash it away

Until then, I'll walk
Until then, I'll breathe in your name
Never surrender, the dream you had for this world, to love, to forgive, to make something out of, nothing!

I will feel you, I will hear you, forever!Embed
