4 ContributorsMasterpiece LyricsWhat a wonderful day, everything is O.K
Not a problem in mind, leaving worries behind
Except for that little doubt you have
Concerning your dress tonight
So you take a bottle of French wine
And you say you don't live twice, you cast the dice
Masterpiece, you should have seen it
That rainbow in the moonglow
Masterpiece, you've got to live it
That new dawn tomorrow
Driving down through Beverly Hills
You feel the breeze of the past in your lungs
What an elegant place, you walk with elephant grace
All Sunset Boulevard has been waiting the star
They all gather to celebrate "Happy birthday my honey dear"
What a joy to see your old mates
In this Hollywood atmosphere, with us at last!
Masterpiece, you should have seen it
That rainbow in the moonglow
Masterpiece, you've got to live it
That new dawn tomorrow
Masterpiece you never act it
But life is a movie
Masterpiece you've got to try it
We're sure you'd be moving
You might also likeYou've had a tango too much, you say you'll keep in touch
Back home in your Rolls Royce you smile and think of the boys
All of a sudden your sight obscures
And your memories drift the air
And you finally feel secure
You're another star up there, a star up there
Masterpiece, you should have seen it
That rainbow in the moonglow
Masterpiece, you've got to live it
That new dawn tomorrow
Masterpiece you never act it
But life is a movie
Masterpiece you've got to try it
We're sure you'd be movingEmbed
