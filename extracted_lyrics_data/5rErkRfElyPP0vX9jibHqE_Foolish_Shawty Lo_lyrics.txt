Just sold a hundred and it just touched down
Call them aliens, time to re-up now

I'm gettin' money, dubs, fifties, hundreds
Say he want what? Naw, he don't really want it
He don't want that drama, listen, boy, I promise
I stay with them goons and you don't want them problems
The place still jumpin', yeah, we doin' numbers
Early in the mornin', in the kitchen like my mama
Niggas on each corner with them thangs on 'em
12 ride by, boy, it's hotter than Daytona
Who wanna? Niggas come and test me
I be on that Bankhead, you can never miss me (Yeah)
Naw, nigga, that rappin' don't impress me
