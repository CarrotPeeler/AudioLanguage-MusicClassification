1 ContributorMossie LyricsI captured your smile, it's been there for a while
I'm previously unreleased
I try to combine, the hard and soft side, to make an anthology
In this wild world there is nothing real to me
So raze up your head and see
That there is such thing as responsibility
If it make's a difference to you?
My love is sustained but who take's the blame
If you are not almighty?
Sometimes your heart is not telling the truth
In this wild world there is nothing real to me
So raze up your head and see
That there is such thing as responsibility
Such a hard feel, is coming over me
I'm not really frightened
Oh, so, you're coming back to me?
Such a hard feel, is coming over meYou might also likeEmbed
