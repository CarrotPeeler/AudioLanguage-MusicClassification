I remember a girl so very well
The carnival drums all mad in the air
Grim reapers and skeletons and a missionary bell
Oh, where do we go now but nowhere?
In a colonial hotel we fucked up the sun
And then we fucked it down again
Well, the sun comes up and the sun goes down
Going 'round and around to nowhere
The kitten that padded and purred on my lap
Now swipes at my face with the paw of a bear
I turn the other cheek and you lay into that
Oh, where do we go now but nowhere?

Oh, wake up, my love
My lover, wake up
Oh, wake up, my love
My lover, wake up

Across clinical benches with nothing to talk
Breathing tea and biscuits and the Serenity Prayer
While the bones of our child crumble like chalk
Oh, where do we go now but nowhere?
I remember a girl so bold and so bright
Loose-limbed and laughing and brazen and bare
Sits gnawing her knuckles in the chemical light
Oh, where do we go now but nowhere?
You come for me now with a cake that you've made
Ravaged avenger with a clip in your hair
Full of glass and bleach and my old razorblades
Oh, where do we go now but nowhere?

Oh, wake up, my love
My lover, wake up
Oh, wake up, my love
My lover, make up

If they'd give me my clothes back then I could go home
From this fresh, this clean, antiseptic air
Behind the locked gates an old donkey moans
Where do we go now but nowhere?
Around the duck pond we grimly mope
Gloomily and mournfully we go 'round again
And one more doomed time and without much hope
Going 'round and around to nowhere
From the balcony we watched the carnival band
The crack of the drum, a little child did scare
I can still feel his fingers pressed in my hand
Oh, where do we go now but nowhere?
If I could relive one day of my life
If I could relive just a single one
You on the balcony, my future wife
Oh, who could have known but no one?

Oh, wake up, my love
My lover, wake up
Wake up, my love
My lover, wake up
Oh, wake up, my love
My lover, wake up
Oh, wake up, my love
My lover, wake up2Embed
