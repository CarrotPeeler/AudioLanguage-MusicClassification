1 ContributorThe Lash LyricsHide, hide here in the crowd
I wish I could let go
Of all that I have seen
No martyrs here today
None, none to take your place
To stand there by your side
To fill your lungs with air
To press your shaking hand
As the lash rips it open
You know how I hurt inside
Just can't be whom you wanted
Fear ties me down
A coward's stare to the ground
Live, to live with all your fear
To sleep with open eyes
To stay forever caged
Like there's nothing more to say
As the lash rips it open
You know how I hurt inside
Just can't be whom you wanted
Fear ties me down
A coward's stare to the ground
You might also likeAs the lash rips it open
You know how I hurt inside
As the lash rips it open
Fear ties me down
As I stare to the groundEmbed
