2 ContributorsNo Matter What Lyrics

It's funny how
We've wasted our time
On so-called friends
Who are really not on our side
They've always got something to say
About us and how we are spending our days
They're trying to confuse us
With their lies and deceit
But they don't really care if we
Live or died on these streets
But you and I
We both know the truth
That we will prevail
As long as God sees us through

No matter what they do
You need to love me
I ain't out there cheating on you
You need to trust me
Wanna see you happy, never blue
You need to love me
And just love me
And just love me
No matter what your friends are telling you
You need to love me
'Cause from me you'll always hear the truth
You need to trust me
I ain't mad at you for being you
You need to love me
'Cause I love you
So just love me
You might also like
I wish that they would leave us alone
And let us be together
Boy, you can't fall victim to those fools
Telling you whatever
You hear about me on the streets
And it'll only make you weak
And put a damper on our situation
They're trying to tear down our foundation
Sick and tired of hateration
But we gone make it as long as we stay patient

No matter what they do
You need to love me
I ain't out there cheating on you
You need to trust me
Wanna see you happy, never blue
You need to love me
And just love me
And just love me
No matter what your friends are telling you
You need to love me
'Cause from me you'll always hear the truth
You need to trust me
I ain't mad at you for being you
You need to love me
'Cause I love you
So just love me
Why do we waste away our lives
Playing simple games
Telling silly lies
How far will they go 'til they realize
What goes around comes around
We got a love you can't break down

No matter what they do
You need to love me
I ain't out there cheating on you
You need to trust me
Wanna see you happy, never blue
You need to love me
And just love me
And just love me
No matter what your friends are telling you
You need to love me
'Cause from me you'll always hear the truth
You need to trust me
I ain't mad at you for being you
You need to love me
'Cause I love you
So just love me
No matter what they do
You need to love me
I ain't out there cheating on you
You need to trust me
Wanna see you happy, never blue
You need to love me
And just love me
And just love me
No matter what your friends are telling you
You need to love me
'Cause from me you'll always hear the truth
You need to trust me
I ain't mad at you for being you
You need to love me
'Cause I love you
So just love me
No matter what they do
You need to love me
I ain't out there cheating on you
You need to trust me
Wanna see you happy, never blue
You need to love me
And just love me
And just love me
No matter what your friends are telling you
You need to love me
'Cause from me you'll always hear the truth
You need to trust me
I ain't mad at you for being you
You need to love me
'Cause I love you
So just love me
