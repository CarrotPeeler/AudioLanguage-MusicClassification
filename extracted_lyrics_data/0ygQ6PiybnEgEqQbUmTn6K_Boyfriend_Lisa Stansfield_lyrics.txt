2 ContributorsBoyfriend LyricsDo I sit alone at home?
Do I pick up the telephone?
Can I keep my self-control with my best friend's boyfriend?
It more than my life's worth to hit on you
The water's too deep but the passion is too
I've got your number in my pocket and your body on my mind
Oh baby why must life be so unkind?
Of all the people it could be
To come and test my loyalty
If only it was anyone but you
'Cos you're my best friend's boyfriend
How am I supposed to handle that now baby?
She's away for the weekend
I just hope my conscience holds me back
I know what my heart says
Whichever way I play it mine's a losing hand
'Cos you're my best friend's boyfriend
And baby what a fine man she has
She told me to call you if I needed you
Little did she know just how much I do
Now the water's getting deeper and I'm swimming for my life
Oh baby why, oh baby why?
You might also likeOf all the people it could be
To come and test my loyalty
If only it was anyone but you
You're my best friend's boyfriend
How am I supposed to handle that now baby?
She's away for the weekend
I just hope my conscience holds me back
I know what my heart says
Whichever way I play it mine's a losing hand
You're my best friend's boyfriend
And baby what a fine man she has
Do I sit alone at home?
Do I pick up the telephone?
Can I keep my self-control with my best friend's boyfriend?
It's a feeling I should never speak of
I'm trying but the flesh is weak
I know I'm getting in too deep with my best friend's boyfriend
You're my best friend's boyfriend
How am I supposed to handle that now baby?
She's away for the weekend
I just hope my conscience holds me back
I know what my heart says
Whichever way I play it mine's a losing hand
You're my best friend's boyfriend
And baby what a fine man she hasEmbed
