2 ContributorsThe Truth Lyrics
If we only knew the truth about it
Maybe we could work our way around it
If we only knew the truth about it
Maybe we could work our way around it (Yeah, oh)

Then maybe we could ignore that the shore used to be the edge
Explore more than our block or the next city over
With nothing on our shoulders
But the clothes on our backs
And you leave us here with nothing
Expecting no attack with soldiers on the way

If we only knew the truth about what really goes on
Maybe all the things I do would make sense just for once
Maybe we could work our way around it (Yeah)
If we only knew the truth about it

(Yeah, oh)
You think it's crazy to think there's nothing to hide
Whenever there's a proposition for me to decide on
There's a million suggestions with a million intentions
With the people getting richer off the people getting poorer
It's due for peeking over
There's justice on the way

If we only knew the truth about what really goes on
Maybe all the things I do would make sense just for once
Maybe we could work our way around it (Yeah)
If we only knew the truth about it (Yeah)

If we only knew the truth about what really goes on and what you said
Behind closed doors, on private lines
If we only knew the truth about what really goes on and what you said
Behind closed doors, on private lines
If we only knew the truth about itâ€¦
If we only knew the truth about it (Whoa)

More than just a lie or two about
What really goes on and what you said
(Whoa)
More than just the right thing to do
The time has just passed us up instead
Maybe we could work our way around it
If we only knew the truth about itEmbed
