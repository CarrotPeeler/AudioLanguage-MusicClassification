3 ContributorsWoman Goinâ€™ Crazy on Caroline Street Lyrics
There's a woman goin' crazy on Caroline Street
Stoppin' every man that she does meet
Sayin' "If you'll be gentle, if you'll be sweet
I'll show you my place on Caroline Street"

She claimed in a loud voice to be a dancer
But I don't think she's cut a rug in years
Listens to the jukebox for her answers
Slowly guzzles twenty-five cent beers

Talks about the men she's known and then some
She's seen them in her dreams and on the street
She slides her dapper legs from beneath the table
As if to reveal some kind of treat

There's a woman goin' crazy on Caroline Street
Stoppin' every man that she does meet
Sayin' "If you'll be gentle, if you'll be sweet
I'll show you my place on Caroline Street"

Her lover left her stranded in Jamaica
Just right now she can't recall his name
Perceiving she's the center of attention
And all the lurking eyes, they look the same
You might also like
Weather's got the shrimpers in a frenzy
They're horny and don't need a good excuse
Someone yells and things just start erupting
And in a flash, all hell has broken loose

There's a woman goin' crazy on Caroline Street
Stoppin' every man that she does meet
Sayin' "If you'll be gentle, if you'll be sweet
I'll show you my place on Caroline Street"

When I woke up and looked around the barroom
She was gone and I was black and blue
So be careful when you go to swing your partner
Someone just might take a swing at you

There's a woman goin' crazy on Caroline Street
Stoppin' every man that she does meet
Sayin' "If you'll be gentle, if you'll be sweet
I'll show you my place on Caroline Street"

Yeah, there's a woman goin' crazy on Caroline Street
Stoppin' every man that she does meet
Sayin' "If you'll be gentle, if you'll be sweet
I'll show you my place on Caroline Street"Embed
