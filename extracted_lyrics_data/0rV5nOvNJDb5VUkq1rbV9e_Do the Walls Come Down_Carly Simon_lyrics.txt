4 ContributorsDo The Walls Come Down Lyrics(Carly Simon/Paul Samwell-Smith)
Do the walls come down
When you think of me
Do your eyes grow dim
Do the walls come down
When you think of me
Do you let me in
Nothing like a rainy night
To set your heart rememberin'
Nothing like a vivid dream
To take you back again
When you think of me
Do your eyes grow dim
Do the walls come down
When you think of me
Do you let me in
Something in my pocket
That was written years ago
In faded ink says, 'You are my fire'
Do you think so...
Is it easier for you to say
You never loved me anyway
Or do you hide me in your attic trunk
Like a stowaway?You might also likeEmbed
