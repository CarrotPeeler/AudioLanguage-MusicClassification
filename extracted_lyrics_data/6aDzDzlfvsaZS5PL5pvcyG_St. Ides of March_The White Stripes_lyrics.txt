3 ContributorsSt. Ides of March LyricsAin't she lookin' good
Ain't she lookin' fine
Ain't she lookin' fine
And she takes her time
Don't you walk away
Sweet potato pie
Sweet sugar plum
Sweet sugar plum
But look what you done
Don't you walk away
Ain't she lookin' good
Ain't she lookin' fine
Ain't she lookin' fine
And she takes her time
Don't you walk away
Sweet potato pie
Sweet sugar plum
Sweet sugar plum
But look what you done
Don't you walk away
Oh, no, oh
You might also likeAin't she lookin' good
Ain't she lookin' fine
Ain't she lookin' fine
And she takes her time
Don't you walk away
Sweet potato pie
Sweet sugar plum
Sweet sugar plum
But look what you done
Don't you walk away
Yeah! Yeah!Embed
