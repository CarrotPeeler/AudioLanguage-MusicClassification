3 ContributorsIs It Any Wonder LyricsListen, aah
Look
(One, two, three, five, six)
Soldier, soldier, won't you marry me?
You must fight
On the surface he seems sensible
But underneath the logic is crazy
Like a cat that walks with cruelty
Or a dog that always bites for no reason
I could feel the madness there
But I couldn't see the streets for the houses
And all the lies and fantasies
Were suddenly malicious and dangerous
For every passing day you put me through
Oh, what have I done to you?
Is it any wonder that I never close my eyes?
Sisters of normality
Collapse into convulsions of laughter
Knuckle walking animals
Are swaggering and spilling their anger
And they're almost standing upright
As they try to ape the madmen around them
But the slightest, kindest hint of love
Leaves them naked, snorting like horses

Oh, I hope I never come down
Is it any wonder that I never close my eyes?
Leaving it all behind
Focus and wasting time
Here in this lullaby
We'll leave them all behind
Thoughtlessly wasting time
We'll be gone in the blink of an eye
But is this really where the story ends
For all those so-called friends?
Is it any wonder that they think I've lost my mind?
If that's what they think, then fine
We'll leave them all behind
Is it any wonder?
Is it any wonder?
Is it any wonder?
Is it any wonder?
We'll leave them all behind (Look, ah)
We'll leave them all behind (Listen)
Hearing these words of mine (Look, ah)
Hearing these words of mine (Listen)
Hearing these words of mine (Look, ah)
Hearing these words of mine (Listen)
Hearing these words of mine (Look, ah)
Hearing these words of mine (Listen)
(Look)
