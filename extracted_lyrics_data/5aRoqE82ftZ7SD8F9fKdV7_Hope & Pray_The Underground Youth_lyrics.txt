1 ContributorHope & Pray LyricsShe won't come down no matter what you say
She climbed a wall of sound and said you made her this way
But tonight I need her loving hands all over me, It's a long long way but can't you see,can't you see
Well those tears are fresh and she can still smell you
You see her in the flesh and don't believe that it's true
I want you in every single way on every single day
Oh girl you better hope and
I want you in every single way on every single day
Oh girl you better hope and
I want you on every single day in every single way
Oh girl you better hope and pray yeah , hope and pray
Oh girl you better hope andYou might also likeEmbed
