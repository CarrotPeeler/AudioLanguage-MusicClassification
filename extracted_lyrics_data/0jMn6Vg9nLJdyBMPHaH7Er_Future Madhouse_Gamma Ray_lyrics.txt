2 ContributorsFuture Madhouse Lyrics
In the morning, you try to recover
But you still got the red in your eyes
Then you get up and look in the mirror
And you see the beast arise
Got a big, red nose from the overdose
And somebody else's eyes
And you think to thee, "Is it really me?"
And you have to realize

The price that you pay for a moment like this
Is never too high 'cause you still doing it
Don't you know that we all stand in line?
Our future dreams are just a waste of time

Our future
Is a madhouse, and we all are movin' in
Our world needs some action
'Cause there's nothing left to gain

Take your baggy, things are ready
You only need to come
Join this century's schizoid clan
The rooms are primed and done
You might also like
The price that you pay for a moment like this
Is never too high 'cause it perfectly fits
Don't you think that you are wasting time?
Insanity is just a state of mind

Our future
Is a madhouse, and we all are movin' in
Our world needs some action
'Cause there's nothing left to gain


Our world—is a madhouse in the gutter, come on in
Our world—needs some action, satisfaction, till the end
Our world—we need sex and crime
To supply our minds an amazing time, come on in
Our future—and we party on till our life is done
Just to waste our time—till the endEmbed
