1 ContributorIt’s No Joke Lyrics
She got into the car, there's no way she could know...
The stranger in the backseat, he's fogging up the windows
On the way to the party, in the lap of the phone...
The feast of the sweet end, on the side of the road...

For a joke…
It’s no joke...
That’s no joking matter...

Wheel of the sun, wheel of the sand
We're curling our toes in it, love is so grand...
We are summoned that night...
We're shooting up the street lights…
Beeping guns and parrot pit stalls…

For a joke
It’s no joke
That’s no joking matter!
Yeah for a jokе
It’s no joke
That’s no joking matter!

Throw my hands into the air!
'Causе it’s all I can do
It’s all I can do for now
Throw my hands into the air!
'Cause it’s all I can do
It’s all I can do for now…

It’s no joke!
That’s no joke!
That’s no joking matterEmbed
