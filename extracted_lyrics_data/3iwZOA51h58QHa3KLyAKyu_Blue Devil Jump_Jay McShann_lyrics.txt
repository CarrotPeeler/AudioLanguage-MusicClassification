Hazbin Hotel:
So things look bad, and your back's against the wall
Your whole existence seems ****in' hopeless
You're feelin' filthy as a dive bar bathroom stall
Can't face the world sober and dopeless
You've lost your way, you think your life is wrecked
Well, let me just say you're correct
Wait, what?
You're a loser, baby
A loser, god**** baby
You're a ****ed-up little whiny *****
Hey!
You're a loser, just like me
Thanks, ***hole
You're a screws-loose boozer
An only one-star reviеws-er
You're a power-bottom at rock bottom
But you got company
This supposеd to make me feel better?
There was a time I thought that no one could relate
To the gruesome ways in which I'm damaged
But lettin' walls down, it can sometimes set you straight!
We're all livin' in the same **** sandwich

Watch as we reanimate our corpses you abandoned
We're dismantled, we're mishandled

Life's like a road that you travel on
When there's one day here and the next day gone
Sometimes you bend, sometimes you stand
Sometimes you turn your back to the wind
There's a world outside every darkened door
Where blues won't haunt you anymore
Where the brave are free and lovers soar
Come ride with me to the distant shore
We won't hesitate
To break down the garden gate

If you're goin' my way

All the little kids runnin' 'round you can hear their stomachs growlin'
There's a full moon out, and my girl just keep on howlin'

Benji X Scarlett:

The Lonely Island:
Yeah, and here's another piece of advice
Stay away from kids, 'cause their hair is filled with mad lice
There's no such thing as too much Purell
This a cautionary tale, word to George Orwell
So don't 1980-force any plugs into sockets
Always wear a chastity belt and triple lock it
Then hire a taster, make him check your food for poison
And if you think your mailman is a spy, then destroy him
No blankets or pajamas, they can choke you in your sleep
Two words about furniture: killing machines
Now, board your windows up the sun is bad for your health
And always wear a straitjacket so you're safe from yourself
Uh huh, take no chances, stop freelancin'
Invest in your future, don't dilute your finances
401K, make sure it's low risk
Then get some real estate (how much?), 4.2%
Thirty-year mortgage, that's important, that's a great deal
And if you can't afford it, don't forge it on your last bill
Renting is for suckers right now
A dependable savings and you'll retire with money in your account
Beast!
YOLO, say no-no
Isolate yourself and just roll solo, be carefulo
You Oughta Look Out also stands for YOLO
You know that we are still young
Burn the prints off your thumbs
Then pull out all your teeth
So you can't bite your tongue
Only on this earth for a short time, time
So don't go outside, cause you don't want to die, die
Just take our advice and hide
And scream YOLO to the sky
You oughta look out

They said I rap like a robot, so call me Rap-bot
But for me to rap like a computer it must be in my genes
I got a laptop in my back pocket
My pen'll go off when I halfcock it
Got a fat knot from that rap profit
Made a livin' and a killin' off it

But as rude and as indecent as all hell

Obliterating everything, incinerate a renegade
I'm here to make anybody who want it with the pen afraid
But don't nobody want it, but they're gonna get it anyway
'Cause I'm beginnin' to feel like I'm mentally ill
I'm Attila, kill or be killed, I'm a killer bee, the vanilla gorilla
You're bringin' the killer within me outta me
You don't wanna be the enemy of the demon who entered me
And be on the receivin' end of me, what stupidity it'd be
Every bit of me's the epitome of a spitter

Or you finna be dead the minute you run into me

Man, I'm not gonna let you poison me
I threw it on the ground
You must think I'm a joke
I ain't gonna be part of your system, man!
Pump that garbage in another man's veins
I go to my favorite hotdog stand
And the dude says, "You come here all the time. Here's one for free."
I said "Man, what I look like? A charity case?"
I took it...
And threw it on the ground
I don't need your handouts
I'm an adult! Please!
You can't buy me, hot dog man
At the farmers market with my so-called "girlfriend"
She hands me her cell phone—says it's my dad
Man, this ain't my dad!
This is a cell phone
I threw it on the ground
What you think, I'm stupid?
I'm not a part of your system
My dad's not a phone! Duh!

Now a ***** can't answer calls 'cause I'm ballin'
I was wakin' up, gettin' racks in the morning
I was broke, now I'm rich, these *****s salty
All this designer on my body got me drip, drip, ayy
Straight up out the Yajects, I'm a big Crip
If I got a pint of lean, I'ma sip, sip
I run the racks up with my queen like London and Nip
But I got rich on all these *****s, I didn't forget, back
I had to go through the struggle, I didn't forget that
I hopped inside of the Maybach and now I can sit back
These *****es know me now 'cause I got them big racks
'Cause I'm gettin' money now, I know you heard that
Young ***** on the corner, *****, I had to serve *****
Uncle fronted me some P's, had to get them birds back
We came up on dirty money, I gave it a birdbath
Cut off the brain and I give my ***** a new coupe

That ***** sold more **** than the young Harry O
From Punta Cana to Ghana to Ontario
He made it snow all over the whole barrio
His lil' brother Luigi, he was a real *****
He took mushrooms, they used to make him feel bigger
His job was to pick up the **** like a pooper scooper
And drop it off without gettin caught by the Koopa Troopa
One day they hit Mario on the jack
Told him they had his *****, want a hundred stacks to get her back
He thinkin "What kind of **** is that?
This ain't a video game, lame, we finna go tit for tat"
He lit his cigarette, took a drag of the cancer smoke
And with this hit, he burnt a hole in the ransom note
Then he wrote with ease and I quote
"Y'all must really want one of these in your throat"
