2 ContributorsMove in the Right Direction (Seamus Haji club mix) LyricsOne step closer, I'm feeling fine
Getting better one day at a time
I'm moving forward with all of my might
I'm headed toward a new state of mind
So Iâ€˜ll hold back tears
Move in the right direction
Face my fears
Move in the right direction
I'm doing fine
One step closer every day at a time
I won't lose my mind, lose my mind, ah ah
Motivation a powerful strength
Hesitation was my first instinct
I got the notion my weakness was
Total devotion it's okay because
I will hold back tears
So I can move in the right direction
I have faced my fears
Now I can move in the right direction
I'm doing fine
One step closer every day at a time
I won't lose my mind, lose my mind, ah ah

Reminiscing will get you nowhere
Never say never, starting over
It's not perfect but it's getting closer
I hold back tears
So I can move in the right direction
I have faced my fears
Now I can move in the right direction
I'm doing fine
One step closer every day at a time
I won't lose my mind, lose my mind, ah ahEmbed
