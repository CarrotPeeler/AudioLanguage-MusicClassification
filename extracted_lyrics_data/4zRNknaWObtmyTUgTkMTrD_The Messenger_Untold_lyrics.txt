2 ContributorsH O L Y Lyrics
You can't fly those things in here
You sitting on a pot of gold
You know they had the pigs in here
We seen it from across the road
He said it like he knew
But couldn't tell me why its almost
Like i knew but couldn't prove it like
Like a half truths a whole lie
Back in few hold tight
I ain't really waiting i ain't needing no time
Back in few hold tight
I ain't really waiting i ain't needing no time

Said i need to question
I don't need this lesson
But i need to learn
When do you leave depression
How you see the message
Not the messenger
Until i go up high
Seed get watered i multiplied
Ima be out here
Unlearning shit
Cuz they been selling a lie
And when i tell em goodbye
Songs don't play
And we don't obey
But you see my eyes
Looking looking looking looking closer
Songs don't play and we don't obey
But you can see my eyes
How you how you feel
You can see my eyes
Looking looking looking looking closer
Songs don't play and we don't obey
But you can see my eyes
How you how you feel
You can see my eyes
You might also like
You can't fly those things in here
You sitting on a pot of gold
You know they had the pigs in here
We seen it from across the road
He said it like he knew
But couldn't tell me why it's almost
Like i knew but couldn't prove it like
Like a half truths a whole lie
Back in few hold tight
I ain't really waiting i ain't needing no time
Back in few hold tight
I ain't really waiting i ain't needing no time

Don't sip the drink and chase it with the feelings
Don't post a pic when you know who's listening
Times is changing you ready for the villain
Finding God and losing my religion
Don't sip the drink and chase it with the feelings
Don't post a pic when you know who's listening
Times is changing you ready for the villain
Finding God and losing my religion

You can't fly those things in here
You sitting on a pot of gold
You know they had the pigs in here
We seen it from across the road
He said it like he knew
But couldn't tell me why it's almost
Like i knew but couldn't prove it like
Like a half truths a whole lie
Back in few hold tight
I ain't really waiting i ain't needing no time
Back in few hold tight
I ain't really waiting i ain't needing no timeEmbed
