They say your Caddy ain't been driven right
They say you don't want that thang to idle all night
Let me work on it, baby
I'll fix it up for you
I'll have your motor purring like a kitten
Girl, when I get through

So baby, don't panic
'Cause I'm the shade tree mechanic
So baby, don't panic
'Cause I'm the shade tree mechanic

You say your generator ain't working too fine (No, no)
They tell me you need your front end aligned (Ooh yeah)
You don't have to worry
'Cause I'll take care of that
I'll stop your radiator from steaming
I'll adjust the thermostat

So baby, don't panic
'Cause I'm the shade tree mechanic (Ooh)
So baby, don't panic
'Cause I'm the shade tree mechanic
You might also like
They say you ain't had a good tune-up in a long, long while (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
I'll give you good service with a smile
I'll solve all your problems
If you let me under your hood
I'll change your oil
I'll fill it up
I'll lubricate it good

So baby, don't panic
'Cause I'm the shade tree mechanic (Ooh)
So baby, don't panic
'Cause I'm the shade tree mechanic
So baby, don't panic
'Cause I'm the shade tree mechanic (Ooh)
Don't panic, baby
'Cause I'm the shade tree mechanic

(Don't panic) No, no
Don't panic (Shade tree mechanic, ooh)
'Cause I'm the shade tree mechanicEmbed
