1 ContributorBeautiful City Lyrics
Come sing me sweet rejoicing
Come sing me love
We're not afraid of voicing
All the things we're dreaming of
Oh, high and low
Everywhere we go

We can build
A beautiful city
Yes we can
Yes we can
We can build
A beautiful city
Call it out
And call it the city of man

We don't need alabaster
We don't need chrome
We've got our special plaster
Take my hand (Take my hand)
I'll take you home (I'll take you home)
We see nations rise
In each othеr's eyes (In each othеr's eyes)
You might also like
We can build (We can build)
A beautiful city (A beautiful city)
Yes we can (Yes we can)
Yes we can
We can build (We can build)
A beautiful city (Beautiful, ah)
Call it out
And call it the city of man

Come sing me sweet rejoicing (Come sing me rejoicing)
Come sing me love (Keep singing love)
We're not afraid of voicing
All the things (All the things)
We're dreaming of (We're dreaming of)
Oh, high and low
And everywhere we go (everywhere we go)

We can build (We can build)
A beautiful city (A beautiful city)
Yes we can (Yes we can)
Yes we can (Yes we can)
We can build (build)
A beautiful city (A beautiful)
Call it out
And call it the city of manEmbed
