3 ContributorsGet Rid of Your Fears LyricsIn the mirrorland
The only way to get rid of your fears
Is to face them precisely as they are in your own imagination
In the mirrorland
Every word you say is about yourself
In the mirrorland
There's always two in one in everyone
In the mirrorland, in the mirrorlandYou might also likeEmbed
