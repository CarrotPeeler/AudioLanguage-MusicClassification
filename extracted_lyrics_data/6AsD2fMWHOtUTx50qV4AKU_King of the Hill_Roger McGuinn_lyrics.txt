5 ContributorsKing of the Hill Lyrics
L.A.'s asleep, you roll up your window
The night air is cold, the freeway is clear
In a green Gucci bag are you prized possessions
The jewels of your mind to hold back the fear

And when Monday comes 'round, there's a high, lonesome sound
And she follows you down for the kill
And a white, blinding light makes it all seem so right
And you feel like the king of the hill

The driveway is long, your princess is lovely
Your servants all wait for your knock on the door
How many years will you crawl through this castle
So satisfied, and still wanting more

And when Monday comes 'round, there's a high, lonesome sound
And she follows you down for the kill
And a white, blinding light makes it all seem so right
And you feel like the king of the hill
Yeah

The guests have arrived with all the right faces
But you miss the ball in that room down the hall
It's sunrise again, the driveway is empty
The crystal is cracked, there's blood on the wall
You might also like
And when Monday comes 'round, there's a high, lonesome sound
And she follows you down for the kill
And a white, blinding light makes it all seem so right
And you feel like the king of the hill

And when Monday comes 'round, there's a high, lonesome sound
And she follows you down for the kill
And a white, blinding light makes it all seem so right
And you feel like the king of the hill

Yes, you feel like the king of the hill
Ah, you feel like the king of the hill
Yes, you feel like the king of the hillEmbed
