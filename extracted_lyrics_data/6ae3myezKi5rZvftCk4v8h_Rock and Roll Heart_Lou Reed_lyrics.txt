I don't like opera and I don't like ballet
And new-wave French movies, they just drive me away
I guess I'm just dumb 'cause I knows I ain't smart
But deep down inside, I got a rock and roll heart
Yeah yeah yeah, deep down inside I got a rock and roll heart

A rock and roll heart
Lookin' for a good time
Just a rock and roll heart, roll heart, roll heart
Lookin' for a good time

I don't like messages or something meant to say
And I wish people like that would just go away
I guess that I'm dumb 'cause I know I'm not smart
But deep down inside, I got a rock and roll heart
Yeah yeah yeah, deep down inside I got a rock and roll heart

A rock and roll heart
Searchin' for a good time
Just a rock and roll heart, roll heart, roll heart
Lookin' for a good time
You might also like
Yeah, just a rock and roll heart
Lookin' for a good time
Just a rock and roll heart, roll heart, roll heart
Lookin' for a good time, yeah now

Yeah, got a rock and roll heart
Searchin' for a good time
Got a rock and roll heart
Searchin' for a good time
Just a rock and roll heart
Yeah, searchin' for a good time
Yeah, got a rock and roll heart
Yeah, now, now, searchin' for a good time
Let me hear you now
Oh, I hear you nowEmbed
