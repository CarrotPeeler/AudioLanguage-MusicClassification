1 ContributorLife Is Free LyricsYou could be popular
You could be wanting more
It doesn't have to be that way
This could be beautifull
Are you really gonna make it happen
Seems a whispers sometimes louder than a scream
Are you really gonna make it happen
Life is free
You could be a checkout girl
You could be beautifull
You give your all but it's not enough
Is that the way it is?
Are you really gonna make it happen
Seems a whispers sometimes louder than a scream
Are you really gonna make it happen
Life is free
Keep the dream alive
Don't be affraid
I'm suffering my life away
You know
That's all I've got to say
You might also likeAre you really gonna make it happen
Seems a whispers sometimes louder than a scream
Are you really gonna make it happen
