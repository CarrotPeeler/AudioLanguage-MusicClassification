14 ContributorsHypernight Lyrics
Vague, I'm so misleading
Forgotten feelings try to read my mind
Hiding secrets in front of open eyes
See a question in its reflection
Never knowing more
Than if you're the flower or if you're the soil

Spent my life
Trying to make everything right
Hypernight
Widened sight to make me realize

Try to forget all the things
I want to do before I die
It's just a waste of all my precious time
See an answer in darkness pure
Hypernight is mine
The truth is within a darker sky

I don't want to see things differently
It's what I taught myself to believe
You might also like
Spent my life
Trying to make everything right
Hypernight
Widened sight to make me realize

Emotions that I know so well carry me
To a place of discontent, ungrudgingly4Embed
