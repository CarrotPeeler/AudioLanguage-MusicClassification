Imagines
Imagines
Running through my mind
Can't decides what's real
What's a lie
What's dead
And what's alive
Cause I dreamt he's died
Then woke up -- he's back alive
Wishes wishes wish
I wish I never meet the ho
Show the bitch the front doe
Don't encourage bitches
Bitches don't get treats for acting up
Bitch I'm talking dogs
My dogs don't give a fuck
They can see a nigga coming up
I'm dream chasing all that
Started from the bottom
Self made album
Nothing was the same
Thank me for it later
Doris is hottie
I just wanna touch her body
Sit in a Bugatti
Make it on MTV
Maybe BET
Sell a few albums
Surf a few crowds
Lately all it's been is
You might also like
Chaos
Psychotic
Nearly lost my mind, but I found it
Now I'm drowning in my mind
With these ideas of dying
I'm surrounded by lions -- tigers
Falling mountains
Tsunami crashing right before feet
I think I'm dying

First verse I died
Now I'm back alive
To spit this last will and testament
Like nigga why you test me
You ain't got the recipe to make a hit
Then get the fuck away from me
I told you not to message me
A feature non existent
So keep moving --  get away
Head shots when's drop this
All targets hits
Bridges burnt -- they tumble now
You -- yo gurl
You Jack -- She Jill
Go up the hill to fuck a lot
Hidden cam caught it all
I put it out
Titled Destiny for Gayness
They stick a finger up anus
Just to test if they gay
Casualties to will happen
Fatality when rapping
Extreme skill almost master this rap shit
I'm building up an army
Arm with some words, and mask
And fucking off beat
You don't want to go to war with me
I cause habbick, mayhem
Chaos
Psychotic
Nearly lost my mind, but I found it
Now I'm drowning in my mind
With these ideas of dying
I'm surrounded by lions -- tigers
Falling mountains
Tsunami crashing right before feet
I think I'm dying2Embed
