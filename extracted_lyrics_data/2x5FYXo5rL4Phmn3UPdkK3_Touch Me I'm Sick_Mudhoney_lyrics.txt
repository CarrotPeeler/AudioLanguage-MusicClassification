Well, I feel bad
And I've felt worse
And I'm a creep, yeah
And I'm a jerk
Come on!

Touch me I'm sick!
Wow!

I won't live long
And I'm full of rot
I'm gonna give you, girl
Everything I got

Touch me I'm sick!
Touch me I'm sick!

Come on baby, now, come with me
If you don't come
If you don't come
If you don't come
You'll die alone
Woah!

I'm diseased
And I don't mind
And I'm gonna make you love me
'Til the day you die
Come on!

Touch me I'm sick!
Fuck me I'm sick!

Come on baby, now, come with me
If you don't come
If you don't come
If you don't come
You'll die alone!1Embed
