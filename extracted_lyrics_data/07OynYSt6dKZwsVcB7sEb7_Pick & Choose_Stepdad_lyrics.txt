2 ContributorsPick & Choose Lyrics
If I could pick, could pick and choose
I'd choose you, it's old news
If I could pick, could pick and choose
I'd pick you, yeah, I can't lose

Every time I try to call you never pick up the phone
And when you do you've got a million reasons to go
And when I ask you "am I good enough?", you tell me no
Sometimes I feel like I can call your bluff, you ought to know

If I could pick, could pick and choose
I'd choose you, it's old news
If I could pick, could pick and choose
I'd pick you, yeah, I can't lose

You try to talk like all the world's gonna step on your toes
And make me feel like I should never give a damn 'bout your woes
Don't try and tell me I don't understand
I don't think you really understand
Do you believe that you're the only one?
I think you're absolutely wonderful
You might also like
Hold on, hold on
I'd give up everything for your admiration
Hold on, hold on
I wanna let you know that I'm never leaving your side
You and me, we're so caught up in awkward situations
Let me be, be the one who kills this contention
Nothing in this world will stop the beating heart I have for you
Maybe I'm just crazy but I know that you can feel it too, like I do

If I could pick, could pick and choose
I'd choose you, it's old news
If I could pick, could pick and choose
I'd pick you, yeah, I can't lose
If I could pick, could pick and choose
I'd choose you, it's old news
If I could pick, could pick and choose
I'd pick you, yeah, I can't lose1Embed
