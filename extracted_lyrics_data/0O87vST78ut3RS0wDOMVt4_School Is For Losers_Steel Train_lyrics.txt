4 ContributorsSchool Is for Losers LyricsCan you pull me out I think, I might, I think I'm drowning
There was a cool boy, there was a clown, I was alone
And that boy he told me just to give it all up now
Just playing the fool, he wanted me too
I'm not going back to school
I took that van to Austin, Dallas, Texas, Moblile, Alabama
I slept sound, and in that way I never really came home
When you leave yourself on the side of that highway
Forever you run, forever free slaves
I will say whoa, tornado in the sky
I know, I know you want it to
Oh I'll tell you what I want I want a summer til the sun burns out
I'll, follow into the night
Come on, come on swim there with me
Oh I'll tell you what I want, I want a summer til the sun burns
Can you pull me out I think I'm drowning
There was that cool boy he did fall way down that hole
Do you see me down that highway
You're home from school, playin the fool
I will say whoa, tornado in the sky
I know, I know you want it to
But I don't want to blow away without you
I'll, follow into the night
Come on, come on swim there with me
I tell you what I want, I want a summer til the sun burns outYou might also likeEmbed
