1 ContributorBlow My Mind LyricsI've been trying all night to tell you
I've been dying all night to make you mine
To make you mine
I've been going around in circles
I've been anxious and stressed
To let you know
What you should know
And again
You blow my mind, you blow my mind
You lift me when I am down
Oh yeah
Knocked a few bottles down for courage
Threw them up all at once
I'm such a freak, yeah such a freak
Lying there so sick and passed out
I felt your hand on my head
You care for me, you care for me
Then again
You blow my mind, you blow my mind
You lift me when I am downYou might also likeEmbed
