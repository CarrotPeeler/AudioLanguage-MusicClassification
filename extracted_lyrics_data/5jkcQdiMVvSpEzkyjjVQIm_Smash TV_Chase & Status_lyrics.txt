And ended up in a stuck out in the
Middle of this place and it turned up outta the freeway
This little old man comes up to me with a backpack,about
10 bucks between us, and he goes
"You know where you are? you in the jungle baby!"
Jungle, jungle, jungle, jungle
About five or six years ago I hitchhiked here
And ended up in a stuck out in the
Middle of this place and it turned up outta the freeway
This little old man comes up to me with a backpack,about
Ten bucks between us, and he goes
"You know where you are? you in the jungle baby!"
You know where you are? you in the jungle baby!
Jungle, jungle, jungle, jungleYou might also likeEmbed
