2 ContributorsSomerset Lyrics
We met deep down in Somerset
A time I can't forget
When we were sippin' cider in the shade

Oh, the sun was setting in the west
You looked your very best that night
Stars were shining in your eyes

And we walked, walked all along the sand
And it felt, felt like a wonderland

And when the summer breeze was gone
The memory lingered on
You and me down in Somerset


Oh, we walked, walked and walked and walked all along the sand
And it felt just like our love just began

And when the summer breeze was gone
The memory lingered on
Me and you when the summer set
You might also like
We met, we met, we met deep down in Somerset
A time I can't forget
You were sippin' cider in the shadeEmbed
