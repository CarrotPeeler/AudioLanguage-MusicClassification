I walk in the starlight, I walk in the moonlight, and I lay my burden down
I know moonrise, I know starrise, and I lay my burden down
I walk in the starlight, I walk in the moonlight, and I lay my burden down
Chorus:
Stretch out my arms
As the evening fades away
Your soul and my soul
Will meet someday

I know sunrise, I've seen blue skies, and I lay my burden down
I walk in the sunrise, I walk under new skies, and I lay my burden down
I know sunrise, I've seen blue skies, and I lay my burden down
Moonrise... starlight... and I know my burden's found
