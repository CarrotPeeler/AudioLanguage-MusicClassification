6 Contributors20th Century Boy Lyrics
Friends say it's fine, friends say it's good
Everybody says it's just like Robin Hood
I move like a rat, talk like a cat, sting like a bee
Babe, I'm gonna be your man

And it's plain to see, you were meant for me, yeah
I'm your toy your 20th century boy

Friends says it's fine, friends says it's good
Everybody says it's just like Robin Hood
Fly like a plane, drive like a car, hold out your hand
Babe, I'm gonna be your man

And it's plain to see, you were meant for me, yeah
I'm your boy your 20th century toy

20th century boy, I wanna be your toy
20th century boy, I wanna be your toy
20th century boy, I wanna be your toy
20th century boy, I wanna be your toy

Friends say it's fine, friends say it's good
Everybody says it's just like rock and roll
I move like a cat, talk like a rat, sting like a bee
Babe, I'm gonna be your man

And it's plain to see, you were meant for me, yeah
I'm your boy your 20th century toy

20th century boy, I wanna be your toy
20th century boy, I wanna be your toy
20th century boy, I wanna be your toy
20th century boy, I wanna be your toyEmbed
