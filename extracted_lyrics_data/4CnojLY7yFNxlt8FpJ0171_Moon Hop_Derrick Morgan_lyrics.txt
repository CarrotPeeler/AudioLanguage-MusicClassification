3 ContributorsAye Verb vs. Tsu Surf Lyrics
The very, very, very first thing I heard when I touched down, is Surf, the Midwest grooving
That’s something I couldn’t wait for
Now I’m thinking blood, mess, toss him in the lake, sure
Ice him with the pick, pluck him with the tech, Lord have mercy, another nigga rushing to his death
I know, I know, I’m not from here, sound like silly shit, that was a code for a body, let me tell you what it really meant
These niggas never understand me, I rap good
Lake Shore, Mercy, Rush, them Chicago hospitals, I adapt good
The contract said no pat down at the door, Aye Verb I brung it with me
I only know the hospitals in case I gotta go, and the 5 niggas that’s coming with me
Me and the homies watched you and Cortez for a minute, then we all was sleeping
I woulda left scene spic and span, he’s thinkin, but that’s a part of reekin (Puerto rican)
What we about, an hour back? Damn where the time go?
Now that I’m here, I got the biggest cannon in Chicago
You lost to shine, you lost to, you lost every time you in New York You captain marketable of the loser group, lose so much, you gon lose to the shit that I couldn’t use for Mook
Chiraq what up? I came on some rider shit
Nothing different from the D, except they won't find the shit
M and K in the bag, designer shit
Gloves, cops gotta kiss a frog to find the prints (prince)
I’m the kill whoever type, so ya girl get hurt
It sing and lift niggas up, you seen me give Gerald the vert (Gerald Levert)
The whole flight over, I just had visions in my head
No Sandra Bland, I was tryna picture him dead
Kidnap his mother, slit her eyes, nothing to numb the pain
Rope her neck, guess the movie, got it? Hunger games
Take her to the shore, it’s quiet at the cliff deep, and you hear better Take the jump, or take the pump, definition of peer pressure
My big homie said bring the wolves, that fool might try you
Them boys cold, I don’t want to send 'em on ya
Cold? Pneumonia? That flew (flu) right by you
I mean you a buy but, Chicago I’m a bigger sell
I was down state in that hole, we couldn’t think of a sicker cell (sickle cell)
I ain't into heavy metal, I just got these lyrics in a slipknot
Indiana Jones verb, you seen me whip Roc(k)
When it comes to crazy, I’m borderline but more than fine, he bring some of his, I’m bringing more of mine
Warrin time, kill his seed, no more daddy daughter time
Cry, I ain’t Jesus, I ain’t come to war to whine (water wine)
Basically, he dyin, and two of his friends dyin, I touch three parts of his circle like a Benz sign
Tsu Surf got a ghost writer, that’s what them niggas said right?
Well if it is a ghost writer, I swear that nigga dead nice
Ain’t you the nigga that got chased around a car? That’s you? Verb let’s play swear to God
Ain’t you the nigga that got chased around the car? I don’t wanna hear nothing about how you hold heat
Everybody wanna order out, but can’t handle home beef
That’s why you always gotta keep a weapon around
Now it’s Surf, a body hanging by the car, technical foul
All these battle rappers be pussy outside, getting battles and be ready to squirt
Now it’s Surf I’m heating the car up, I’m getting ready for work
You seen what happen to hitman, imagine what I’ll do to you
Oh he a solider? Cool, we’ll let off rounds at his funeral
Jersey

I watched all your battles lil nigga, and the consensus was, nigga you kinda basic
Sports bars, gunlines, a bunch of amateur shit New York finds amazing
Well you in the midwest now lil nigga, look in the crowd
You know how many niggas out there been shot, stabbed, locked up, or seen general population? Your gangster shit you can save it, your street talk out here is like general conversation
You the most arrogant, average rappin, delusional, case catchin, 90 day shock treatment doin, this execution about to be beautiful
Fuck a battle, this a viewin and you the star of the funeral
30 round drum and guess who front row at the musical
Either you get can in tune, or get in tune, that’s your decision
I’m not here to get vocal with him, blank face I play poker with him, send a missile through him since y’all niggas put a motor in him
Big blade, poke it in him, carve a sculpture in him, nigga you a vulture, ghost writers and cultures with him
Damn surf, you a cancer, I gotta kill you for the culture nigga
This ain’t that other shit, you in the presence of a hard writer, bars like a small rykers
Reckless with it, like driving a dodge viper in a storm with torn wipers
Like a box of these arms licensed, get boxes these arms licensed
Y’all don’t war like us, and there’s more like us, long rifles, more trips y’all make to morgue hype us, this gon be a long nighter
Ride down his block with a slow driver, fuck a inf beam, since he a star I’ll strobe light him
What you know about being in the trap no lamp but the stove lighter, two hundred for a charge of ghostwriters save you that whole title(?)
Heard your Mom is on that dust, I keep that bitch nose whiter, get on the rock like Hov like her
I had a deal, you mainstream never, but you’ll work underground like a hole miner, you so minor
Let’s not forget, you came in the game dirty with no lineup, now you in the star’s lineup
Look at God, look how the stars line up
This is how you dissemble a nigga who this assemble to
Forty cal extend his roof, chest shot, his inner child gets a window too
I will eclipse your hot sun with the winter’s moon
All you lil boy ass rappers, I make men of you
I’m coal (cold), you gon die mun (diamond) every second I make minerals
Coal, diamond, you ain’t in a match nigga, you in a school
Word work! You can’t talk crazy to me lil nigga, im from that curb work
I sold everything from the Plan B to that herb work
Tell Gracie, I’m a burn surf
How y’all want him? Urn urf? Load the trey, bring that shit to you, I’m a server
I’m a real rider, I don’t signal before I turn surf
Murder is only my business, I don’t merger
You a lil loc, strapped in the club, you’ll lift your shirt up
I’m a G, strap on me, hand the bouncer a G and still let him search us
Aye Verb vs Tsu Surf see what the fuss is about
You say my name, they send that bread I come put blood in they mouth
You battled Danny, and you said you shot a gun, standing there grimacing, eyes closed, teeth trembling
What kind of shit is that? I just heard voices in my head, picture black, standing stone takin something I wasn’t givin back
Anybody can pull a trigger, when you mean it, make the death colder
You know, walk up, finish the rest, leftovers
After all these years, I figure why this battle shit ain’t feel right
Cause they was makin up guns and bodies, I was givin em real life
Kill everybody, leave the baby, operation team Weezy
Pump straight outta Compton, I can make a sick body seem easy
Less of this, and more of these, cause these, real for listening
I know y’all wanted Suge, but shotguns ain’t good for distance
Three minute rounds, they ain’t book me for a long time, I never had cable, can’t tell you bout no showtime
Look at this, getting fucked for money, hook a bitch, Italian fiesta, ain’t seen rounds as good as this
Derrick Rose, that just mean I’m going with the mask look, Kevin Durant, I prolly hit 40 on the back foot
You battled Grizz Guru and said, first of all you battled Grizz Guru
You battled Grizz Guru and said, you shot at your first car at 22, that ain’t what a body bout
By the time I was 22, I was a hoe with regrets, ashamed of my body count
And these the niggas y’all choose to believe increase the murder rate, then step around the fact that it was him in St. Louis that said that was Hitman across the street shooting the .38
You always got a long ass, drawn out ass story that don’t mean shit Tell us something potent, tell us bout some mean shit
Wait who think this bitch’ll pop, I’ll fucking dare her
I was around funeral boxes way before fucking Phara
I pull up on his street, I’m tryna ef something up
S T F, its about that time son (Thompson?), I brought that Harrison, specifically in case this time come
You ain’t a warrior, didn’t you already kill this nigga Holla?
Gracie called me about the green, I just couldn’t ig a dollar (Iguodala) They say Tsu Surf cold, but all he talk about is hoopin
As long as they say, Tsu Surf cold, and why Tsu Surf always put it in code
Because either the prosecutor Stephen A Smith, or a motherfucker told
I mean think about it, tell me something, what the judge gonna say if I say I pull up with two Melos tryna Steph Curry something
I mean, I keep at least about Harden to spray the chrome, send about Lebron, never Westbrook the clip, cuz a nigga gotta make it home And I really gotta believe this nigga spray slugs? I actually fucked up my shoulder to show that K Love
You came with somebody? I bet you feel alone when you see this rubber grip
Red beam, chrome trim, knee dip in shit
Ah man that’s a gold swim(?), this bitch’ll make Gracie come for you whole skip(?)
Everybody move, I don’t know who to pop, Maury show
That last line made this bitch make Gracie look like Tori Doe
Jersey
That was a cold round Surf, I listened to it with so much joy
Now you know the difference between battling out here, and battling out here, its no bias
If its hot, they gon rock, you heard all that noise
Unfortunately, I’m a professional, how I can take your best round, not get rattled and stand with so much poise
Cause I know any fucking second I want to, I can separate the men from the boys
3 minute rounds they ain’t book me for a long time, fuck the preview, lets let that beef brew, in 3D too, so its showtime
Everybody claim they with the shit until they in a situation
Double barrel, ch ch, I will pump up my brother, but I’m not with the nation
Ride up, hollow his crib, that’s a renovation
Put a couple holes in his roof, extra ventilation
It’s consequence from the pen embrace it
Behind bars, I make niggas come see you, that’s visitation
Pen, behind bars, visitation, that shit was greatness, lets switch the paces
IPhones, send the location, hop out, two arms strapped, like a mental patient
Open your mouth lil nigga, you know the drill like a dental patient
I got his bitch screaming come and get it like dinners waitin
Fuck security, I’m from the hood, you know the animals I was raised with?
A bunch of niggas goin on that water, that’s a slave ship
We on different levels in rap, two different pages
Your fans put lines in your head, that’s a wavekick
You east coast niggas be tripping with all this blade shit
Flash, 8 kick, that put this in the air, that’s a spaceship
What’s in your gun closet? .38 and a K clip? When ours be 9s to 5s, that’s the day shift
One of your hoes hit me on twitter, said I’m her favourite
Said she wanna fuck with you though, something to play with
She said her head was out of this world, nothing basic
You suck that dirty nigga Surf dick bitch? You can’t even taste it Nigga face it, lil loc you confused, off the dumbest issues
I saw you on a picture, with Nipsey, throwing up sixties, but he ain’t chuck it with you
60th street is in California, you from Jersey, dummy lil bitch
You out here pumping they shit and you ain't spend a month in they shit
How you a neighborhood crip and you ain’t from they neighborhood? Crip I knocked out a nigga from Jersey, in Jersey, come get your neighborhood flipped
You want be like that, you gotta be like that, in front of niggas who really like that
And that’s a life fact lil nigga, I ain’t write that
How dare you try to question my stripes? Where my stripes at?
New York boo me? I be like fuck y’all niggas and come right back
A warrior, they try take my armour and I still fight back
But we gon get right back to this shit, nigga I’ll be right back

I said I name that mac love, and name that 50 kindness
Been talking to Grandma lately, a nigga gotta chill on the violence She said you need to be closer to God, a little more humble, more modest
I said Grandma, I can only be honest, I only know how to spread love and kill with kindness
If we was in school, I woulda definitely took your lunch cards
You don’t want to take the round route see (Rousey), these bitches just punch hard
Dressed in all black, outside like a home invader
Mac with 50 gigs, I’ll expose his data
Fuck I gotta put it in subtitles?
Ain’t never get it when he battled, I brought a clip full of Big T battles
Ain’t gotta make a sound, y’all know what that sound like
That pound might ram his head, give him a sound byte
Close ranger, left ear shot don’t sound right
I sold to the addicts half my life, I know exactly what they sniff and why
Confession, I’m an addict, its just this gunpowder give me a different high
I hate when you get to rappin fast, and clappin nines, and saying shit, that don’t rhyme, get gassed up, he’s doing great, then say some shit that’s woah, wait
Verse hitman, that’s just what a real nigga do
Cause he was in some shit, you called and got a pass
That sound like some a whore would do
If I’m tryna run in some shit and my man call for a pass, that’s a audible
I hate when you get to rappin fast, and clappin nines, and saying shit, that don’t rhyme, get gassed up, he’s doing great, then say some shit that’s woah, wait
Verse Arsonal, you was spittin hell shit, then you pulled out a gun you had to shoot with the Elvis
First I was like woo, then I was like nigga please
If he ain’t victor cruz, he won’t dance after six of these
Turn it into disco night, I pull it from the pelvis
These big two rounds from the arm ain’t Elvis
I hate when you get to rappin fast, and clappin nines, and saying shit, that don’t rhyme, get gassed up, he’s doing great, then say some shit that’s woah, wait
Your first shit, vs SB, after that, I wasn’t cool with him
Because he said "he’ll duct tape his mouth, turn him around, bend him over and pool stick him", his exact words
If that was “In too deep” coulda fooled me, cuz I ain't never ever seen that part in the movie
I swear to God, I only did this for the bag, and to tell you in person, suck my dick sucka neighborhood, you a fag
And I think you the only 33 year old nigga that take baths
I catch him slippin late with both ratchets, while I’m comin with the – I’m outta here man, Jersey

Before I start my last round, I want to give a shouts to Gracie
Shouts to gorilla warfare, and this live they gave me
I have one purpose in battle rap, and that’s to guard and gatekeep, St. Louis, Detroit and Chicago
My job is to guard the middle nigga, I’m the safety
Y’all know how I’m known for having a cold third round angle? Well today I don’t have one
Lil nigga made me mad, so I just wanna split him in half, so we gon get back to the foul lines, nigga and one
This is awkward, y’all through a dolphin, in front of a author (?) straight out of arkham, who mastered this artform
The weight off, nigga you upside down like how the arch forms
U upside down, nigga you soft porn
Ima make it dark for him
His first round I thought war, by the second I got bored, now it’s like I’m sippin ciroc throwin darts at a dart board
All this drive don’t mean shit when a shooter park on him
He don’t even know that he dead, just see the sparks from it
Hit the chalk (?) for him, throw the tarp on him, metal his chest, hole in his body, I Tony Stark homie
Take the heart from him, brrrrrr, when I get pissed them pistons start drummin
Dance words, wait, don’t the pistons start Drummond?
If you start something, don’t fire, that bitch big like a large woman Be walkin with his top blew, like Marge comin
The Simpsons, every sentence niggas salute like the sarge comin
He be barking on them lil niggas, big dog round bitch start mumbling
Ima humble him, bring out the humble him, this cocky shit ima crumble it
Every nigga that come with him, gon have to comfort him
Lyrically, I lay niggas in boxes so comfortable, shit like the comfort inn
I’m Godlike, you gon need hymns next time you come in here
You a bitch nigga, next time be in heels next time you come out here. There’s ?, Joe Budden responsible for your whole existence
He let you move in with him, fuck y’all playing, Mr and Mrs?
In the morning you probably kiss him, you cook and he do the dishes He get the bread, take care of the business, buy you gifts and treat you like one of them bitches
And as a man, you think it’s welfare you get assistance?
Nigga dig this, I was taught to get it myself
Nigga you have to, to this day, I be up in the morning, brainstorming with the old heads, eating white castles
You a handout ass nigga, that’s why you can’t stand out ass nigga
After me there’s no more matches, you in front of the last nigga
We used to laugh at ya, not laugh with ya, ask math nigga
You had on bell bottom pants and a shirt with shoulder pads nigga Now you acting like you hardball, nigga you a cornball
See all you new fan niggas, we knew him before y’all
Let me morph y’all, no more chasing you bitches, I don’t torch dog Y’all take the trip, I taught y’all, I’m in my rocking chair
Don’t make me get off that porch dog, cause if I answer, ima let it ring on you, nigga thats your call
Bitch I’m so with the shit, I need more stalls
No running, one man with a stick, who up for court ball
Aye Verb vs Tsu Surf see what the fuss is about
We are not in New York, y’all know what happen, I put blood in they mouthEmbed
