3 ContributorsSubway LyricsSome kind of people don't understand
I've got to turn to the sun
I've got the upper hand
When the world turns around
It turns it turns for you
I guess a whole lotta loving
Don't mean a thing
You gotta stand other people
Don't shout and sing
And when the fight comes to run
It runs and runs for you
I guess that all that I can say
Is just I've gotta have my way
And there's nothing that you can't see through
And there's nothing left for me to do
Funny it's true
I've gotta get get you
And the world it turns
And the fire burns and burns
And all the sickest people die in the flames
And all the twist and turns
And all the twisted suns
And when the fire burns it burns for youYou might also likeEmbed
