4 ContributorsSecond Heartbeat Lyrics
Had enough conversation
I don’t want to hear your pleas no more
So much indignation
How am I supposed to sleep?

‘Cause I finally, finally
Conquered all the falsities
I’m moving on now
I won’t have to see your face around

I’m not gonna wait for you to change when you want to
In a second heartbeat
I’m not listening to you spin like I used to
In a second heartbeat

So much still to say
But not enough time to waste on you
So many holes to fill, ways to give
But not enough time to waste on you

‘Cause I finally, finally
Conquered all the falsities
I’m moving on now
I won’t have to see your face around
You might also like
I’m not gonna wait for you to change when you want to
In a second heartbeat
I’m not listening to you spin like a used to
In a second heartbeat
I’m not gonna wait for you to change when you want to
In a second heartbeat
I’m not listening to you spin like a used to
In a second heartbeat

‘Cause I finally, finally
Conquered all the falsities
I’m moving on now
I won’t have to see your face around2Embed
