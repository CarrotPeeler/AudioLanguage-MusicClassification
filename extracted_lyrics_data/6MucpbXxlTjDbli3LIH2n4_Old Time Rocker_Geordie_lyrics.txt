1 ContributorOld Time Rocker LyricsWell, I'm an old time rocker
I'm sitting here singing the blues
Well, I'm an old time rocker
And I ain't got nothing to lose
No, I ain't got nothing to lose
I've got a load of seventy-eights
I play them every day
I've got a Hound Dog barking in the dark
Just to help me find my way
Just to help me find my way
I've got a pair of Blue Suede Shoes
And a velvet suit there too
So don't you even try to be funny
Or I'll stick one right on you
Or I'll stick one right on you
Well, I'm an old time rocker
Sitting here singing the blues
I'm an old time rocker
And I ain't got nothing to lose
No, I ain't got nothing to lose
I've got a load of seventy-eights
I play them every day
I've got a Hound Dog barking in the dark
Just to help me find my way
Just to help me find my way

And a velvet suit there too
So don't you even try to be funny
Or I'll stick one right on you
Yeah, I'll stick one right on you
I'm an old time rocker
So, I'm sitting here singing the bluesEmbed
