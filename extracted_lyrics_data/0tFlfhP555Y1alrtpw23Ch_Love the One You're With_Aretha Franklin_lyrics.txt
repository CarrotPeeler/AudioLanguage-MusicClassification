2 ContributorsLove the One You’re With Lyrics
A little something that we're experimenting with tonight
So we hope you enjoy it as much as we're going to enjoy doing it

Tell me how can you get through
When you can't remember who you're talking to
Your concentration is just slippin' away
Because your baby is so far away

And the rose in a fisted Glove
And the eagle flies with the dove
And if you can't be with the one you love
Why don't you love the one you're with
Why don't you love the one you're with
Yeah, it's alright, ain't it?

Don’t be angry (Don’t be)
Baby, don’t be sad (Don’t be)
Don’t sit back top thinking about some goods that you had
There’s a boy sitting next to you
Why don’t you check him out, see what he wants to get into
You might also like
There’s a rose in a fisted glove
And the eagle flies with the dove
And if you can’t be with the one that you love
Why don’t you love the one you’re with
Love the one you’re with
Yeah, it’s alright, ain't it? Ha ha

Dah-dah
Dah-dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah-dah
Dah-dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah-dah
Dah-dah-dah, dah-dah-dah, hey
Love the one you’re with
Love the one, love the one you’re with
Love the one

Don’t be angry (Don’t be)
Don’t be sad (Don’t be)
Don’t sit back fooling about some good times you had
Because there’s a boy, standing right next to you
And you don’t know what he wants to get into
Check him out
There’s a rose in a fisted glove
And the eagle flies with the dove
And if you can’t be with the one you love
Why don’t you love the one you’re with
Love the one you’re with
Love the one you’re with, yeah
Love the one you’re with, mmm
You ought to love
The one you’re with (Why don’t you)
You ought to love (Why don’t you)
The one that you’re with (Why don’t you)
Why don’t you love (Why don’t you)
The one you’re with (Why don’t you)
You ought to love (Why don’t you)
The one you’re with (Why don’t you)
Oooooh
Dah-dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah-dah
Dah-dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah-dah
Dah-dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah-dah
Dah-dah-dah, dah-dah-dah, huh
You ought to love (Why don’t you)
The one you’re with (Why don’t you)
Why don’t you love (Why don’t you)
The one that you’re with (Why don’t you)
You ought to love (Why don’t you)
Love the one you’re with (Why don’t you)
Tell me why don’t you (Why don’t you)
Love the one you’re with (Why don’t you)
Oooooh
Dah-dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah-dah
Dah-dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah-dah
Dah-dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah-dah
Dah-dah-dah, dah-dah-dah
Thank you for making me feel real goodEmbed
