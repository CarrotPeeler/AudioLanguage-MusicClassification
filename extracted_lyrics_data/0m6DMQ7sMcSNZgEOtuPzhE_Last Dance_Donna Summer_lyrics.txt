Last dance
Last chance for love
Yes, it's my last chance
For romance tonight

I need you by me
Beside me to guide me
To hold me
To scold me
'Cause when I'm bad, I'm so, so bad

So, let's dance the last dance
Let's dance the last dance
Let's dance this last dance tonight

Last dance
Last chance for love
Yes, it's my last chance
For romance tonight

Oh, I need you by me
Beside me to guide me
To hold me
To scold me
'Cause when I'm bad, I'm so, so bad
You might also like
So, let's dance the last dance
Let's dance the last dance
Let's dance the last dance tonight

Yeah
Oh, oh
Oh, well
Will you be my Mr. Right?
Can you fill my appetite?
I can't be sure that you're the one for me
All that I ask is that you dance with me
Dance with me
Dance with me
Yeah

I need you by me
Beside me to guide me
To hold me
To scold me
'Cause when I'm bad, I'm so, so bad

So, let's dance the last dance
Let's dance the last dance
Let's dance the last dance
Let's dance the last dance tonight
Ooh, ooh, yeah
Ooh, ooh
Oh, I need you by me
To guide me, to guide me
To hold me and to scold me
'Cause when I'm bad, I'm so bad

So, come on, baby
Dance that dance
Come on, baby
Dance that dance
Come on baby, let's dance tonight
