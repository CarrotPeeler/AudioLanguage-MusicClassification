15 ContributorsMontségur Lyrics
I stand alone in this desolate space
In death, they are truly alive
Massacred innocence, evil took place
The angels were burning inside
Centuries later, I wonder why
What secret they took to their grave
Still burning heretics under our skies
Religion's still burning inside

At the gates and the walls of Montségur
Blood on the stones of the citadel
At the gates and the walls of Montségur
Blood on the stones of the citadel
At the gates and the walls of Montségur
Blood on the stones of the citadel
At the gates and the walls of Montségur
Blood on the stones of the citadel

As we kill them all so God will know his own
The innocents died for the Pope on his throne
Catholic greed and its paranoid zeal
Curse of the grail and the blood of the cross
Templar believers with blood on their hands
Joined in the chorus to kill on command
Burned at the stake for their souls' liberty
To stand with the Cathars to die and be free

The book of Old Testament crippled and black
Satan, his weapon is lust
Living this evil damnation of flesh
Back to the torture of life
The perfect would willingly die at the stake
And all of their followers slain
As for the knowledge of God they had claimed
Religion's still burning inside

At the gates and the walls of Montségur
Blood on the stones of the citadel
At the gates and the walls of Montségur
Blood on the stones of the citadel
At the gates and the walls of Montségur
Blood on the stones of the citadel
At the gates and the walls of Montségur
Blood on the stones of the citadel

As we kill them all so God will know his own
The innocents died for the Pope on his throne
Catholic greed and its paranoid zeal
Curse of the grail and the blood of the cross
Templar believers with blood on their hands
Joined in the chorus to kill on command
Burned at the stake for their souls' liberty
Still burning heretics under our skies

As we kill them all so God will know his own
Laugh at the darkness and in God we trust
The eye of the triangle smiling with sin
No Passover feast for the cursed within
Facing the sun as they went to their grave
Burn like a dog or you live like a slave
Death is the price for your soul's liberty
To stand with the Cathars to die and be free

At the gates and the walls of Montségur
Blood on the stones of the citadel
At the gates and the walls of Montségur
Blood on the stones of the citadel
At the gates and the walls of Montségur
Blood on the stones of the citadel
At the gates and the walls of Montségur
Blood on the stones of the citadel1Embed
