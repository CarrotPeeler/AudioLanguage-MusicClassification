1 ContributorToy Baby Grand LyricsThis one went down to marketplace
Consignment rescue mission base
Clothes on the mannequin
Just worn by Adrienne yesterday
Toy baby grands sleep by the wall
Descending decades down the hall
Dust bunnies on the keys
Performing their masterpiece for you and me
A woolen landslide of plaid and stripes
A brandished Ph.D
Now she's your wife to be
But just you wait, just you waitYou might also likeEmbed
