8 ContributorsThe Prowl Lyrics
I see you walkin' after dark
Tradin' looks with other men
But I'm the only one you need
And I know just where you've been
Oh, can't you see the tears I've cried?
And soak them up like a towel
For now I'll be one step behind

Oh, girl you got me on the prowl
Oh girl
Oh girl
Oh girl

I crawl around most every night
And I'm all wrapped up in your spell
I wish someone would understand
But you know I could never tell
I'll just live on in the dark
If there's no harm, there's no foul
Well now my love for you is strange

Oh, girl you got me on the prowl
Oh girl
Oh girl
Oh girl
