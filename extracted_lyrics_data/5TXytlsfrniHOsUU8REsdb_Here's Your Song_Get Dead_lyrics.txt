1 ContributorHere’s Your Song LyricsIt goes like the ghost
I was once before you came around again
It’s so uninviting unpredictable
Well I know when I know what I know
I drink so slow. It’s all a circus that unfolds
Made of smoke and empty souls
I’m told all hearts will run as cold
As dirt upon coffins filled with bones
It’s not something that goes away
They’re all feelings that never fade
Something burning deep inside of me
On and on
Well here is your song
Stay calm
Like a shaky hand over a bomb
Pray to god you do know wrong
Be strong
In the presence of destruction
And it’s the same sad song
And try to figure out all the reasons
Why nothing ever works out right
And you cry tears of absolution
For everything that lives inside
It’s not something that goes away
They’re all feelings that never fade
Something burning deep inside of me
On and on
Well here is your song
It goes like the ghost
I was once before you came around againYou might also likeEmbed
