9 ContributorsSpit It Out Lyrics
And if you're hurting
I will replace the noise with silence instead
Flushing out your head
If you like it violent
We can play rough and tumble, fall into bed
And I won't breathe so you can recover

When you're in pieces
Just follow the echo of my voice, it's okay
Tune into that frequency
Don't fight your reflex
Embrace the instinct, you can feel your way
Through the burden we face in the end

'Cause it breaks my heart that we live this way
I know people need love, but people never play the game
And we talk the talk, we communicate
But then people need love, and those people never play the game

Pleasure for pleasure
A tease is consequence enough for a fall
But I know you love to take the risk
The past is weakness
Don't beg the question when the answer is war
There are moments when I'm overcome
You might also like
'Cause it breaks my heart that we live this way
I know people need love, but people never play the game
And we talk the talk, we communicate
But then people need love, and those people never play the game

And it breaks my heart
And it breaks my heart
People need love1Embed
