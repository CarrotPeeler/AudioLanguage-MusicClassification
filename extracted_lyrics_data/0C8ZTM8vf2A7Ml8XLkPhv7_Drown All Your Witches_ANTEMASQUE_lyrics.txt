4 ContributorsDrown All Your Witches LyricsMy blood runs cold
Through the streets of New Orleans
And drink they will this bitter wine
Our faith has burnt
From torches pushing southbound
Unpunished goes no godly deed
All I've ever done was hold the levee's thirst
How could you sit there
Just watching without a sound?
On that day, with our backs against the wall
Is that how you drowned all your witches?
Down in the ocean, one by one disappeared
Down in the ocean, one by one disappeared
I fill these bags and stack them against the dam
My, I'm on the wrong side of this wall
And when the cracks appear
The sirens will serenade
On just the wrong side of mercy
All I've ever done is hold the levee's thirst
How could you sit there
Just watching without a sound?
On that day, with our backs against the wall
Is that how you drowned all your witches?
You might also likeDown in the ocean, one by one disappeared
Down in the ocean, one by one disappeared
If you should find yourself against the current
And the whites of your eyes go greet the Dawn again
Just listen for that hymn that we've always sung
'Is that how you drowned all your witches?'
Down in the ocean, one by one disappeared
Down in the ocean, one by one disappeared2Embed
