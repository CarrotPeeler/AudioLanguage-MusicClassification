2 ContributorsDust My Broom Lyrics>
I'm gon' get up in the mornin'
I believe I'll dust my broom
I'm gon' get up in the mornin'
I believe I'll dust my broom
‘Cause I quit the best man I was lovin'
Now my friends can have my room
I don't want no man, that wants every downtown man he meets
No, I don't want me no man, that wants every downtown man he meets
For they are some no-good doers, they shouldn't be allowed on the street
Let me tell you
I’m gonna write me a letter, I’m gon’ telephone every town I know
I’m gonna write me a letter, I’m gon’ telephone every town I know
“Cause you see my age is moving’ on, and my patience is running low
I believe, I believe my time has gone
I believe, I believe my time has gone
‘Cause I quit the best man I was lovin’
And I broke up my happy home
All right…
