2 ContributorsFrom The Future LyricsI guess I’m coming to you from the future
There’s a moonlit square upon my bed
Creepy and electric blue
I guess it’s just what moons must do these days
To get their light shone through
The moon screams in my ear
“Stay up all niiiiiiightt
Day is fake and you know I’m right
It shoots all that excessive light
And just distracts us from the facts:
We’re floating in a vast expanse of black.”
I will admit that I fear the future
Or I fear there won’t be one at all
Creeping in as futures do
It’s something you could never prove
Just live or maybe not live through
The moon screams in my ear
“Stay up all niiiiiiightt
Day is fake and you know I’m right
It shoots all that excessive light
And just distracts us from the facts:
We’re floating in a vast expanse of black.”
You might also likeI can see the future beckoning
With its dirty little finger
When it calls to me
I will follow
I can see the future beckoning
With its dirty little finger
When it calls to me
I will follow
The moon screams in my ear
“Stay up all niiiiiiightt
Day is fake and you know I’m right
It shoots all that excessive light
And just distracts us from the facts:
We’re floating in a vast expanse of black.”Embed
