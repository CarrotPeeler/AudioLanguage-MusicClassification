Darlin'
I'm feeling pretty lonesome
I'd call you on the phone-some
But I don't have a dime
(Verse 2)
Darlin'
You're so far behind me
Tomorrow's gonna find me
Further down the line
(Pre-Chorus)
Takin' me some paper
Pencil in my hand
I'm gonna write
(Chorus)
Darlin'
You know I feel the cold nights
Thinking of the old nights
Spent alone with you
Darlin'
The tear is in my eye now
Knowing I can try now
To make it back to you
You might also like(Instrumental Break - harmomica)
(Bridge)
Darlin'
Love you more than ever
Wish we were together
Darlin' of mine
(Verse 1)
Darlin'
I'm feeling pretty lonesome
I'd call you on the phone-some
But I don't have a dime
(Verse 2)
Darlin'
You're so far behind me
Tomorrow's gonna find me
Further down the line
(Outro)
Oh my darlin'
(I'm feeling pretty lonesome) Darlin'
(I'd call you on the phone-some) Oh yeah
(But I don't have a dime) Not one dime!
Darlin' (Darlin')
(I'm feeling pretty lonesome) Ooh
(I'd call you on the phone-some) Ooh oh oh
(But I don't have a dime) Oh no noEmbed
