7 ContributorsTraveling Through a Sea LyricsTraveling through a sea
Every day will shine
Pour yourself out in me
Though can they still 
I just wanna go home
To my 
And swim above the water
I could be so lonely
 of me
Water's rising, dreams
To remind me
( fell asleep)

 with the 


 sky
What is 
 the same 
, in me

Pulling myself down
Into the water
Water's rising, dreams
To remind me
 left to be asleepYou might also likeEmbed
