(That's e- hahaha, one, two, three, four!)

What a glorious hell we have found
Until I recognize the sound
Of my voice again
For years I hadn't had a clue
But suddenly I can look through
Your eyes again
This isn't sex, I don't think, it's just extreme empathy
She's not my ex, we never met, but do you still think of me?
They say that the world is one, but if the world is one
How come you never come around anymore?
(I guess it's not that simple)

Well, everyone learns to live with their sins
But girl you wear yours like a brand new skin
So take it all off and let me back into your…

It's an unforgiving world
She's not an unforgiving girl
It's an unforgiving world
She's not an unforgiving girl
You might also like
Welcome to the Welcome Center
Make a U-Turn
My phone is freaking out
I'll lose my shit while it re-routes but
She moves and
She speaks and
She's on a chain that moves towards perfection
Baby, the effects are so good these days
If there were gears behind those big brown eyes
I wouldn't be able to tell the difference
Oh, girl
You know you got to be forgiving in a world like this
It's a small world
And you know you got to come see me sooner or later
Girl, you know I know...

Alright, now listen girl (yeah?)
I'm only gonna say this once
I just need to make something... make s-
I just need to make sure of something
And I feel like we both know it
I just wanna ask:
We're dancing, right?
This is dancing
Well, everyone learns to live with themselves
And you're not the only one who's been through hell
So give me a sign that I'm not making love to myself

It's an unforgiving world
But she's not an unforgiving girl
It's an unforgiving world
But she's not an unforgiving girl

It's an unforgiving world
But she's not an unforgiving girl
(It's an unforgiving world
But she's not an unforgiving girl)
It's an unforgiving world
But she's not an unforgiving girl
(It's an unforgiving world
But she's not an unforgiving girl)
It's an unforgiving world
But she's not an unforgiving girl
(It's an unforgiving world
But she's not an unforgiving girl)
It's an unforgiving world
But she's not an unforgiving girl
(It's an unforgiving world
But she's not an unforgiving girl)
It's an unforgiving world
But she's not an unforgiving girl
(It's an unforgiving world)
It's an unforgiving world
But she's not an unforgiving girl
(It's an unforgiving world)
It's an unforgiving world
But she's not an unforgiving girl
It's an unforgiving world
It's an unforgiving world
But she's, she's not an unforgiving
(It's an unforgiving world)
That's it... I like that one
(I was horrible on that one)
Fuck you2Embed
