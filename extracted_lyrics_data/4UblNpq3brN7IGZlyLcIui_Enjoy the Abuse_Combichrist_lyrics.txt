Enjoy
Everybody hates you
Next time you open your mouth
I'll put my fist down your throat
So deep you cannot swallow
I'll make your body hollow
You will enjoy the abuse
'Cause you've got nothing to lose
I swear I'll fistfuck your brain
Until I'm smiling again
Everybody hates you
Enjoy (enjoy) the abuse 
Enjoy (enjoy)
Enjoy  the abuse
Next time you're down on your knees
And you're expecting a slap
It might be me in that mask
And I just might have a bat
You might also likeEnjoy the abuse
Enjoy
Enjoy the abuse
Enjoy
Enjoy 
Next time you open your mouth
I'll put my fist down your throat
So deep you cannot swallow
I'll make your body hollow
You will enjoy the abuse
'Cause you've got nothing to lose
I swear I'll fistfuck your brain
Until I'm smiling again
Enjoy the abuse
Enjoy

Enjoy the abuse (enjoy)
