5 ContributorsRye Whiskey Lyrics
Jack of Diamonds, Jack of Diamonds, I know You most of all
You've robbed my poor pockets
Of silver and gold
And Whiskey, you villain
You've been my down-fall
You've cuffed and you've kicked me
But I loved you of old

Oh Whiskey, Rye Whiskey
Whiskey I cried
If I don't get rye Whiskey
I surely will die

Well I go yonder mountain
And build me a still
And I send you a gallon
For a five dollar bill
Well it's beefcake when I'm hungry
Whiskey when I'm dry
And it's greenbacks
When I'm hard off
And hell when I die
See Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds LiveGet tickets as low as $59You might also like
I said Whiskey, Rye Whiskey
Whiskey I cried
If I don't get rye Whiskey
I surely will die

If the sea were made of Whiskey and I was a duck
I'd swim to the bottom and never come up
Oh, but the sea ain't made of Whiskey and I ain't a duck
So I play Jack Of Diamonds and trust on my luck

I said Whiskey, Rye Whiskey
Whiskey I cried
If I don't get rye Whiskey
I surely will die
I said Whiskey, Rye Whiskey
Whiskey I cried
If I don't get rye Whiskey
I surely will die
If I don't get rye Whiskey
I surely will dieEmbed
