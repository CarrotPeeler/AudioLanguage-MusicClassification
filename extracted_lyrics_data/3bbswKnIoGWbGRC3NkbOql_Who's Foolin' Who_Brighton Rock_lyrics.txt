1 ContributorWho’s Foolin’ Who LyricsAn open road
A thirst to chase the night
A room for five
A long highway delight
Let it ride
No rules, they spoil the moment
So turn down the lights
And fuel my appetite
A trail of hearts behind me
Faces that fade at night
Never to be touched again
So chase the dream
Face the fight
Heaven within reach
At a price
The price is high
Baby, that ain't no surprise
Who's foolin' who
Blinded and reckless
Born to break all the rules
Who's foolin' who
Free the night
And free to choose
You might also likeEvading all responsibility
Eluding ties that put a strain upon me
Free to run
Hell, I'm only havin' fun
Images fading fast
Who promised it would last
Who's foolin' who
Blinded and reckless
Born to break all the rules
Who's foolin' who
Free the night
And free to choose
Play it hard!
A trail of hearts behind me
Faces that fade at night
Heaven within reach at a price, oh...
Who's foolin' who
Blinded and reckless
Born to break all the rules
Who's foolin' who
Oh, born to break all the rules
So who's foolin' who, oh, yeah
Oh...Embed
