3 ContributorsWalk Like a Zombie LyricsYou walk like a zombie
You talk like a zombie
It's not in your head
You're a living dead
Whatever you're gonna do
You're gonna make me cry
You walk like a zombie
(You make me wanna cry)
You talk like a zombie
It's not in your head
(Cry)
You're a living dead
Whatever you're gonna do
You're gonna make me cry
And you wanna hold hands
In the cemetery
And you wanna be lost
For all eternity
And everything is dark
And kind of scary
And you crave the full moon
But I don't care
And you want a mountaintop
With a little castle
And you wanna name our kids
Morticia and Fester
And all the flowers you bring
Are always dead
And you howl at the moon
But I don't care
You might also likeSix feet under
You make me wonder
You wanna be undead
So you can be hunted
But whatever you're gonna do
I'm gonna follow you
Six feet under
(You make me wanna)
You make me wonder
(Fo-o-ollow you)
You wanna be undead
(Fo-llow)
So you can be hunted
(You)
But whatever you're gonna do
I'm gonna follow you
And you wanna hold hands
In the cemetery
And you wanna be lost
For all eternity
And everything is dark
And kind of scary
And you crave the full moon
But I don't care
And you want a mountaintop
With a little castle
And you wanna name our kids
Morticia and Fester
And all the flowers you bring
Are always dead
And you howl at the moon
But I don't care

And you wanna hold hands
In the cemetery
And you wanna be lost
For all eternity
And everything is dark
And kind of scary
And you crave the full moon
But I don't care
And you want a mountaintop
With a little castle
And you wanna name our kids
Morticia and Fester
And all the flowers you bring
Are always dead
And you howl at the moon
But I don't ca-a-a-are
Oh, oh, oh
Whoa-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Aah, aah-aah
Aah, aah-aah
