16 ContributorsRunaway Lyrics
My little runaway
Your heart can't take the games you play
It cuts you like a razor blade
My little runaway

The night has just begun
Can you cover what you're hiding from?
Something beautiful and dangerous
What we keep close to us

My little runaway
I wonder where you are
Will you be back someday?
My little runaway

I wonder where you are
Are you sliding down the tops of cars?
Your hair melting into silver stars
May you never go too far
My little runaway
Your heart can't take the games you play
It cuts you like a razor blade
You need to run away
You might also like
My littlе runaway
I wonder where you arе
Will you be back someday?
