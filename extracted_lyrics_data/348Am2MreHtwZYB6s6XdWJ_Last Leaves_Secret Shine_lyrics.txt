6 ContributorsDate Line (I Am Gone) LyricsThis was just a matter of
Me getting what I needed
Till I was safe upon the other side
Of the international date line
It was just a matter of
Me keeping myself seated
Till the pilot killed the overdrive
And landed in a place where you can't
Find me there
Find me there

When you hold one chance
And you break your hands
When the secret's safe
And you call my name
Then I am gone
I'm tired of you and me
And the space that's in between
And I would rather be somewhere
With better thoughts and warmer air
I'm tired of trying to be
Somebody different than me
I'm tired of trying to shine it on
When the lights go out tonight, I'm gone
I'll run from here
Run
You might also like

When the hurt gets real
And you still can't feel
When you can't escape
And you cannot stay
Then I am gone

Safe upon the other side
Of the international date line
I landed in a place that you can't find
You can't find me there
You can't find me there


When the last plane leaves
And you cry for me
When you lie awake
And you feel it break
Then I am goneEmbed
