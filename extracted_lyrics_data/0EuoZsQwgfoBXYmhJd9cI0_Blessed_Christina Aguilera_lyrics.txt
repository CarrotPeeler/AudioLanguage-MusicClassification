13 ContributorsBlessed Lyrics
Ooh-ooh
Hmm-hmm-yeah

When I think, how life used to be
Always walking in my shadows
Then I look, at what you've given me
I feel like dancing on my tip-toes
I must say everyday I wake
And realize you're by my side
I know I'm truly

Blessed for everything you've given me
Blessed for all the tenderness you show
Do my best with every breath that's in me
Blessed to make sure you never go

There are times, that I test your faith
'Til you think you might surrender
Baby I'm, I'm not ashamed to say
That my hopes were growing slender
You walked by in the nick of time
Looking like an answered prayer
You know I'm truly

Blessed for everything you've given me
Blessed for all the tenderness you show
Do my best with every breath that's in me
Blessed to make sure you never go
Blessed with love and understanding
Blessed when I hear you call my name (hear you call my name, baby)
Do my best with faith that's never-ending
Blessed to make sure you feel the same

Deep inside of me, you fill me with your gentle touch
You know I'm truly

Blessed for everything you've given me
Blessed for all the tenderness you show
Do my best with every breath that's in me
Blessed to make sure you never go (Never, never, never go)1Embed
