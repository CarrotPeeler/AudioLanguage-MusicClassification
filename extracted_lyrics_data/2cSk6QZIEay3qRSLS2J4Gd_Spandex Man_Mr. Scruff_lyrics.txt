Songs In A Minor
Mr. Man (featuring Jimmy Cozier)
(jimmy):
Somethin' about the way you smiled at me just drove me wild
Wish i could tell if you're alone, don't want to cramp your style
But i can not deny the feeling that i feel when i looked straight into your eyes
Feel my heart beating fast for the challenge may arise
Chorus 1:
I wanna know if you feel the way i do, i do
I wanna know if there's a chance for me and you, and you
If there's no way meet at the bar and say we can't, we can't
'cause i don't wanna be, i don't wanna be, i don't wanna be
Unfair to mr. man
Unfair to mr. man
Unfair to mr. man
Unfair to mr. man
Unfair
(alicia):
Like the way you've given me attention through the night
Maybe i've had too much remy my; man's right by my side
Every time i catch you watching me i feel something down my spine
I'll play the game it's just for fun and only for tonight, all night
Chorus 2:
I wanna know if you feel the way i do, i do
I think you're hoping there's a chance for me and you, and you
Should i meet you at the bar and say we can't, we can't
'cause i don't wanna be, i don't wanna be, i don't wanna be
Unfair to mr. man
Unfair to mr. man
Unfair to mr. man
Unfair to mr. man
Unfair to mr. man I know all you wanna know is answers
'cause you can give me what i need (you can give me everything i need)
We both know that we're attracted
Should we let our desires lead?
