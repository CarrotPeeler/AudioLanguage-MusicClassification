1 ContributorThe Warden Lyrics
I've loved lost and such, been washed up to rust
I came back like the cavs 3-1 to clutch
The same gatch I don’t need face tats for ink to stay masked on this life I live
I stay amped in this pipe I hit the silent kid a mind that asylums hid I stay frosty
Pale as the nights I hid with headspace like the nights I tripped my days probably
Were wasted, looking back in regrets
My reflection is a mask of myself
I question who I am nowadays like im asking for help
Will you save me day to day I dwell daily
With thoughts of my future, past a self tutor
Gatch the pen ruler, call me the warden
Hah, the Fred Krueger haunting men who slept through my true depths you can call this a warning
Shot, raised glass when recording stops
Spat flames since the cord was cut I'm bored to fuck of all the props
I'll call your bluff was born to cuss the lord construct a storm for applause and -
(Beat Change)

How can I, How can I, yea
How can I juggle these daggers and not get a scar
Most of these rappers are never on par
Spitting like actors and when your in showers is the only time you drop bars
Most of you brag about bitches and money well isnt it funny how short it can last
Put me on mics im unbearable like its the revenant, call me Hugh Glass
Cold as the motives of Lecter I lecture you lambs till the silence brews
And sip coffee, woke as they wakes that you won’t have seen on tv I don't hide the truth
I hit rocky, roping and doping in bars while I aim for the stars you apollos fall
Watching you ronda's fall at pitstops, one hit and your shit stops to blow
Shit I got the pissed off flow
Force-feeding um four course meals when I spit these schemes
With a style like aborted fetuses rhymes that just don't get old
I said once they get better with age
More praise than a veterans grave
But I get judged like a court case, fuck for the foreplay
Leave a poor taste in the mouths that doubt me
Rest assured the best is yet to come
I set the score to leave the greatest one
You slept o' course the metaphors are meant to pour
My reigns only just begun and my names on the cusp of tongues
Put trust in none I had love now I lust for some
Trap drums get the gatch treatment when I feel it
They lack semen cause none can come close
Puff smoke but its nuff jokes now
Cutthroat with the cards close to my chest
I suggest you jesters get to grips
And shut your lips I left all my intentions clear
Attention dear, I cut the shit
When I blessed the beat with more bars than a judge can fit
I make waves your a gust of wind
Game face and I come to win
So lets play like I'm Jigsaw, why Pardon the Roast
Dick soft but im harder than most
Pissed off kid cause they still talk shit
I'm a Hitchcock flick and your hardly a show
Come to beef its over budget
Overboard im bored of the beats and dumb shit
And I'm more than what meets the eye
Pipe dreaming at night cause it keeps me highYou might also likeEmbed
