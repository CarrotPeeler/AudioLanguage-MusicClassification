3 ContributorsWhat Are They Doing In Heaven Today LyricsBut they've gone off to heaven, but I want to know
What are they doing there now?
Oh, what are they doing in heaven today
Where sin and sorrow are all done away?
Peace abounds like a river, they say
But what are they doing there now?
There's some whose hearts
Were burdened with care
They paid for their moment with fighting and tears
But they clung to the cross trembling in fear
But what are they doing there now?
What are they doing in heaven today
Where sin and sorrow are all done away?
Peace abounds like a river, they say
What are they doing there now?
And there's some whose bodies were full of disease
Physicians and doctors couldn't give them much ease
But they suffered 'til death brought a final release
But what are they doing there now?
What are they doing in heaven today
Where sin and sorrow are all done away?
Peace abounds like a river, they say
What are they doing there now?
There's some who were poor and often despised
They looked up to heaven with tear-blinded eyes
While people were heedless and deaf to their cries
But what are they doing there now?
What are they doing in heaven today
Where sin and sorrow are all done away?
Peace abounds like a river, they say
What are they doing there now?

What are they doing in heaven today
Where sin and sorrow are all done away?
Peace abounds like a river, they say
