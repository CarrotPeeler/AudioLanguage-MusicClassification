Be seated, the gold is ripe for your retrieve
The stars, the sky, it's way too much for me
I sit and wait for what was once believed
I sit
I watch
I wait
I sit
I watch
I wait
I sit
I watch
I wait
I sit
I watch
I wait
A crown of thorns was put upon his head
His blood ran black as it dripped down his neck
The nails of sand were nailed into his hands
His pain was beautiful to every child and man

I watch
I wait
I sit
I watch
I wait
I sit
I watch
I wait
The blood decides your fate
The blood decides your fate
The blood decides your fate
The blood decides your fateEmbed
