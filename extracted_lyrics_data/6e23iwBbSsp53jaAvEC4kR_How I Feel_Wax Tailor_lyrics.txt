2 ContributorsHow I Feel Lyrics
On the stage, please
They're all waiting for you

Birds flying high, you know how I feel
Sun in the sky, you know how I feel
Breeze drifting on by, you know how I feel
It's a new dawn, it's a new day
It's a new life for me
Yeah, it's a new dawn, it's a new day
It's a new life for me
Ooh, ooh, ooh

Birds flying high, you know how I feel
Sun in the sky, you know how I feel
Breeze drifting on by, you know how I feel
It's a new dawn, it's a new day
It's a new life for me
Yeah, it's a new dawn, it's a new day
It's a new life for me
Ooh, ooh, ooh

Birds flying high, you know how I feel
Sun in the sky, you know how I feel
Breeze drifting on by, you know how I feel
It's a new dawn, it's a new day
It's a new life for me
Yeah, it's a new dawn, it's a new day
It's a new life for me
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Birds flying high, you know how I feel
Sun in the sky, you know how I feel
Breeze drifting on by, you know how I feel
It's a new dawn, it's a new day
It's a new life for me
Yeah, it's a new dawn, it's a new day
It's a new life for me
Ooh, ooh, ooh

Okay, let's hear you
