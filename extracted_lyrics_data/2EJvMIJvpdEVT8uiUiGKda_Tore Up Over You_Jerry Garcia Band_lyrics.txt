2 ContributorsTore Up Over You LyricsEver since you've been gone
I just cry the whole night long
Since the day you said good-bye
You hurt me so, no lie, no lie
Tore up over you and just can't find my way
Tore up, yeah, yeah, yeah, tore up
Tore up, yeah, yeah, yeah, tore up
Tore up over you and I just can't find my way
You never loved me like you told me so
If you did, how could you go?
It was you, not me that left
And went away with someone else
Tore up over you and I just can't find my way
Tore up, yeah, yeah, yeah, tore up
Tore up, yeah, yeah, yeah, tore up
Tore up over you and I just can't find my way
Tell me what did I do
To make you go away
Tell me what can I do
To make you come back to stay
I'm tore up over you and I just can't find my way
You might also likeTore up, yeah, yeah, yeah, tore up
Tore up, yeah, yeah, yeah, tore up
Tore up over you and I just can't find my wayEmbed
