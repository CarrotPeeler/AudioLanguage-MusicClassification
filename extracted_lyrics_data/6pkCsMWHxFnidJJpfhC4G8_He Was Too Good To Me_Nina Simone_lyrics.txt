2 ContributorsHe Was Too Good To Me Lyrics
He was too good to me
How can I get along now?
So close he stood to me
Everything is all messed up and wrong now
My baby would have brought me the sun
'Cause making me smile, that was his fun

When I was mean to him, he didn't say, "Go away now"
You see I was his queen to him
Who's gonna make me gay now?
It's only natural that I'm blue
'Cause my baby was too good to be true

I said he was too good to me
How am I ever get along now?
So close he stood to me
Everything's all messed up and wrong now
He would have brought me the sun and the moon
'Cause anytime I left him, it was too soon

When I was mean to him, he didn't say, "Go away now"
I was his queen to him
Who's gonna make me gay now?
It's only natural
Said it's only natural that I'm so blue
He was too good to be trueYou might also like1Embed
