4 ContributorsVoice of R&B LyricsWhat the game really need
Is the true voice of R&B
So I gave y'all the chance to lead
Now that I'm back, relax and breathe
Now guess who's back?
That nigga with them platinum plaques
How you gon' deal with that?
Tell me how you niggas wanna act?
New deal, few mil'
Nigga check my stats
And I'm still on the block
Hustlin' just don't stop
How you think I iced the watch
And I still got whips to cop
Clowns gon 'mess around
Have to lay 'em down
What the game really need
Is the true voice of R&B
So I gave y'all the chance to lead
Now that I'm back relax and breathe
I'm the same ol' cat
Same number, same hood
You know where I'm at
Yea, I wish a nigga would over react
You might also likeStill gotta like a mother
Don't make me black
You don't want none of that
I represent this R&B, y'all know this
How can you compete, I'm focused
And I'm thinkin' you should pack it up
'Cause Jah got what they want, believe me
What the game really need
Is the true voice of R&B
So I gave y'all the chance to lead
Now that I'm back, relax and breathe
I been sittin' back in the cut patiently waitin'
Watchin' you close, learnin' from your mistakes and
They gazed you up, now you sittin' on E
I'm the new voice of R&B
I'm sick of this and I just can't get with it
Hope you stacked up your chips
Now won't you sit back and breathe?
'Cause Jah got what they need
What the game really need
Is the true voice of R&B
So I gave y'all the chance to lead
Now that I'm back, relax and breatheEmbed
