Baby
I want you, you want me
I've been feeling lonely
Let me talk to you
You're so sexy, babe, don't know what to do
I ain't got no time
Time to play no games
Whatever you want to do
Baby, I feel the same, you know that
I want you, you want me
Tell me, what's it gonna be?
I want you, you want me
That's the way it's got to be
What we have is special, too good to be true
We have to be careful, I'm in love with you
I ain't got no time
Time to play no games
Whatever you want to do
Baby, I feel the same, you know that
I want you, you want me
Tell me, what's it gonna be?
I want you, you want me
That's the way it's got to be
