1 ContributorFood Chains LyricsArtificial for these strictly conscious times
Organic prothesis with a view to paying in kind
To ease (the) guilt of scores of undignified ends
Strung up, disemboweled right out of the pen
So unbeknowing in their anonimity
'Cause when you're marked for death
Ears switch off to the screams
Primal urges
Blindly cull, tear and chew
Remember - Don't scorn what God gave to you
What God gave to you
Reverting, technologically advanced
Yet bloodily we regress
Reversal - Looking forward to a pressure bolt
Through the head?
Numbness - second only to dumbness
Sure, they don't feel a thing!
