Deep red brick the valley snow
Streets all wet and rainy oh
A veil, a veil of tears
When it comes it comes in low
One too late to block the blows
All I know is I suppose
It's what I always feared
Something right keeps going wrong
I can feel the stars shooting through my heart like rain
The rhythms leaving scars turn all the pleasure into pain
Point me in the light of a bright and shining right direction
And then take me back home again
Jesus moved it underground
He's lying low and can't be found
Blew his hair and let it down
Hope for something new
Everything that made him cling
Tied up with a ball of string
When he held it in the wind
It sprouted wings and flew
Went to find the bed of you
You might also likeI can feel the stars shooting through my heart like rain
The rhythms leaving scars turn all the pleasure into pain
Point me in the light of a bright and a shining right direction
And then take me back home again
Up above or down below
Deep red brick the valley snow
Streets all wet and rainy oh
A veil, a veil of tears
When it comes it comes in low
One too late to block the blows
All I know is I suppose
It's what I always feared
Something going wrong
I can feel the stars shooting through my heart like rain
The rhythms in the scars turn all the pleasure into pain
Point me in the light of a bright and shining right direction
And then take me home again
I can feel the stars shooting through my heart like rain
The rhythms in the scars turn all the pleasure into pain
Point me in the light of a bright and shining right direction
And then take me back home againEmbed
