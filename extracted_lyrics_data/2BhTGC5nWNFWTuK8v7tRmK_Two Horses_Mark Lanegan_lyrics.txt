2 ContributorsTwo Horses Lyrics
I check out when the dance is done
The world takes an overdose
I feed on the Easter flower
And search for that starry crown
I can't help it

I trip on the teeth and feathers
Outside the factory
My horses click their hooves together
And caravan down through the desert
I can't help it
I can't help it

I check out when the dance is done
Seen all I was meant to see
Blind men walking the high wire
Above an Eden of magnolia trees
I can't help it
I can't help it

I trip on the teeth and feathers
Outside the factory
My horses asking one another
Why have I led them to black water?
I can't help it
I can't help it
I can't help itYou might also likeEmbed
