Those times that I waited
For you seemed so long ago
I wanted you far too much
To ever let you go
You know you never got by "I feel it too"
And I guess I never could stand to lose
It's such a pity to say

Goodbye to you
Goodbye to you

Could I have loved someone
Like the one I see in you?
I remember the good times, baby, now
And the bad times too
These last few weeks of holding on
The days are dull, the nights are long
Guess it's better to say

Goodbye to you
Goodbye to you
Goodbye to you
Goodbye to you
You might also like
'Cause baby, it's over now
No need to talk about it
It's not the same
My love for you's just not the same
And my heart, and my heart, and my heart can't stand the strain
And my love, and my love, and my love won't stand the pain
And my heart, and my heart, and my heart can't stand the strain
And my love, and my love, and my love...

Goodbye to you
Goodbye to you
Goodbye to you
Goodbye to you

Now could I have loved someone
Like the one I see in you?
Yeah, I remember the good times, baby, now
And the bad times too
These last few weeks of holding on
The days are dull, the nights are long
Guess it's better to say

Goodbye to you
Goodbye to you
Goodbye to you
Goodbye to you, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Goodbye, baby
(Goodbye, baby)
So long, darling
Goodbye to you
Goodbye to you, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Bye-bye, baby
(Bye-bye, baby)
So long, darling
Goodbye to youEmbed
