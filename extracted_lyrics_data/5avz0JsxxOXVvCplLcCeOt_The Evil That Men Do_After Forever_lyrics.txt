2 ContributorsThe Evil That Men Do LyricsLove is a razor and I walked the line on that silver blade
Slept in the dust with his daughter, her eyes red with
The slaughter of innocence
But I will pray for her
I will call her name out loud
I would bleed for her
If I could only see her now
Living on a razor's edge
Balancing on a ledge
Living on a razor's edge
(4x)
The evil that men do lives on and on
Circle of fire my baptism of joy at an end it seems
The seventh lamb slain, the book of life opens before me
But I will pray for you
And some day I may return
Don't you cry for me
Beyond is where I learn
Living on a razor's edge
Balancing on a ledge
Living on a razor's edge

The evil that men do lives on and on
Living on a razor's edge
Balancing on a ledge
Living on a razor's edge
You know, you know
(4x)
The evil that men do lives on and on
The evil, the evil
The evil that men do
The evil, the evil
The evil that men doEmbed
