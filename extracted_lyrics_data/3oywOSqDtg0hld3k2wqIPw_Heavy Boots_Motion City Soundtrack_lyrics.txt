Long live the echoes of my despair
Dissolving into nothing
I swear they'll never take me alive
They'll never pull my strings again

Sometimes I think I just need to vent
A million little pieces
Other times the feelings get too intense
I want to cut them out

Soon to be history

Staring at the ocean
Waiting for the world to end
Skating on the surface
Trying hard to comprehend
Wishing on a moment

Staring at the ocean
Waiting for the world to end
Skating on the surface
Trying hard to comprehend
Wishing on a moment
Searching for the answer

Hope for me and I don't care
No I don't care

I see the evidence piling up
That we are nothing special
I swear they'll never take me alive
They'll never pull my strings I'm

Staring at the ocean
Waiting for the world to end
Skating on the surface
Trying hard to comprehend
Wishing on a moment
Searching for the answer

Destiny is finally erased
Hope for me
Erased hope for me
Erased hope for me
And I don'tEmbed
