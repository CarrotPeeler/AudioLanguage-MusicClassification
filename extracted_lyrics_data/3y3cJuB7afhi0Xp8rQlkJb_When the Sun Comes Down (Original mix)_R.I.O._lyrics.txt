2 ContributorsWhen The Sun Comes Down (Original Mix) Lyrics

Time to wake up
In every nation
Go feel the vibration
That takes me away (That takes me away)
Me people stand up
To fight desperation (To fight desperation)
As we're raising, raising
Until the break of day, ayy

I will lift you up, we can stir it up
Feel the love around when the sun comes down
People, give it up, 'cause we're rising up
Like the sun (Like the sun), so hold on
I will lift you up, we can stir it up
Feel the love around when the sun comes down
People, give it up, 'cause we're rising up
Like the sun, so hold on

Right

Come share my dream
No facing, no fighting
Me love like deep shining
All that it way, ayy
Me people, get off
To join this foundation
As we're raising, raising
Until the break of day, ayy
You might also like
I will lift you up, we can stir it up
Feel the love around when the sun comes down
People, give it up, 'cause we're rising up
Like the sun (Like the sun), so hold on
I will lift you up, we can stir it up
Feel the love around when the sun comes down
People, give it up, 'cause we're rising up
Like the sun, so hold on

Come on down
And share all your dreams
The time has come
To gather the rainbow colors
Open up your heart you will see we can
Hold on, hold on

The road is clear
So gather all your friends around and
Take them one by one by the hand
To a peaceful, lovely place, hold on

I will lift you up, we can stir it up
Feel the love around when the sun comes down
People, give it up, 'cause we're rising up
Like the sun, so hold on
I will lift you up, we can stir it up
Feel the love around when the sun comes down
People, give it up, 'cause we're rising up
Like the sun, so hold on
