3 ContributorsFor Life Lyrics
Just get up and run!

Just give into this way of mine
You're tucking away all those things inside
Never remember the truth
You'll fall and you'll know, I'm right
And you're dead inside
I'm taking away the purpose that means the most
You can try to become everything you hide
That you love and you fight for

When you were lost and fading away
I was holding the line, so come alive now and see the day again
And now there's hope in your eyes
And now there's hope in your eyes
You're away from the demons you fight
For now and for life

Another step inside, you're seeing nothing that gives you comfort
Another reason to hate this place
What would you say to me?
If you couldn't mind
Will your spirit open our eyes to the only reason that we stay awake
You might also like
When you were lost and fading away
I was holding the line, so come alive now and see the day again
And now there's hope in your eyes
And now there's hope in your eyes
You're away from the demons you fight
For now and for life

You were lost and fading away
I was holding the line, so come alive now and see the day again
And now there's hope in your eyes
And now there's hope in your eyes
You're away from the demons you fight
For now and for lifeEmbed
