1 ContributorRun Faster LyricsFeel like I got purpose
Print our thoughts in curses now
Lines in front of churches
Know I've got my purpose now
Will you stay home?
Move out to the back
Cos I'm out on attack
For you
Feel like I got purpose
Fighting for my purpose now
Members in a meeting talking out in the back
And I'm try'na get in without so much as a struggle
I look at how you state "it's too much of a good thing"
I don't know if it's safe in our neck of the woods
Singing whoa-oh
Whoa-oh
Still I look at how you state "it's too much of a good thing"
Now I know that it's safe in our neck of the woods
Singing whoa-oh
Whoa-oh
Will you stay home?
Move out to the back
Cos I'm out on attack
For you
We'll run faster
We'll run faster
We'll run fasterYou might also likeEmbed
