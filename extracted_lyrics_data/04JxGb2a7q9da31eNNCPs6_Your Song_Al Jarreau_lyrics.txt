It's a little bit funny, this feeling inside
But I'm not one of those who can easily hide, oh I
Well, I don't have much money, but boy if I did
You know I'd buy a big house where we both could live, oh live

If I were a sculptor, but then again no
Or a man sitting making potions in a traveling show, oh I
Well, I know it's not much, but girl, it's the best I can do
You see, my gift is my song and this here one's for you, ooh, just for you

And you can tell everybody that, that this is your song
Oh, the words may be quite simple but now that it's done, yeah
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind
That I put down in words
How wonderful life is while you're in the world, yes girl, uh huh, yes girl

I sat on the roof child, yes I did in fact, I kicked off the moss
But a few, a few of the verses, you know they, well they got me quite cross
Oh, but the sun's been real kind while I wrote, wrote down this song
You see it's for people like you that, well that keep it turned on, oh

So please excuse my forgetting, but these things I do, yeah
Well, you see girl I've forgotten if they're green or they're blue
Oh, well anyway, you know the thing is, honey, what I really mean
God knows that only yours are the sweetest eyes I believe I have ever seen
Oh Lord, yeah
You might also like
And you can tell everybody there that, that this is your song, yes you can
Oh, the words may be quite simple but, but now that it's done
Yes, I hope you don't mind, don't mind
That I put down in words
How wonderful life is while you're in the world
Every single line, one more time, girl
I hope you don't mind, hope you don't mind
That I put down in words, ooh, these sweet words
How wonderful life is, baby, while you are in my world

Believe I sit you here on the dock of the bay, watching the tide rolling away
Say I'll be thinking of you, love, sweet memories to all of you, all of youEmbed
