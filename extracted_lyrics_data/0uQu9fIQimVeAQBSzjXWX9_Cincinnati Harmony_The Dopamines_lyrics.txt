1 ContributorCincinnati Harmony LyricsSo proud of your new life
You say I'm a joke
So I'm digging your eyes out
With the keys to your new home
Why the long face?
What do I think of your success? It sucks
Now wait a moment while I hold my hand up to stifle a yawn
This is my opinion
What do I think of your success?
Why don't you ask me in 45 minutes when I'm drunk off my ass
So next time you won't ask
So you got a raise this week?
So you got a new car?
Oh how have I been doing lately?
Wouldn't you like to compare
Well since you asked: I'm clinically depressed
I lost my job and everyone thinks I'm worthless
Booze on my breath, holes in my shoes
Make no mistake, better off than you
What do I think of your success?
Now wait a moment while I hold my hand up to stifle a yawn
This is my opinion
What do I think of your success?
Why don't you ask me in 45 minutes when I'm drunk off my ass
So next time you won't ask
What do I think of your success?
Why don't you ask me in 45 minutes when I'm drunk off my ass
So next time you won't askYou might also likeEmbed
