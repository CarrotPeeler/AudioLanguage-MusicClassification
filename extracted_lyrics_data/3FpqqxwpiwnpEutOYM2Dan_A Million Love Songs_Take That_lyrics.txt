7 ContributorsA Million Love Songs LyricsPut your head against my life
What do you hear?
A million words just trying to make
The love song of the year
Close your eyes but don't forget
What you have heard
A man who's trying to say three words
The words that make me scared
A million love songs later
And here I am trying to tell you that I care
A million love songs later
And here I am, here I am
Million love songs later
And here I am
Looking to the future now
This is what I see
Million chances pass me by
Million chances to hold you
Take me back, take me back
To where I used to be
And hide away from all my truths
Through the light I see
A million love songs later
And here I am trying to tell you that I care
Million love songs later
Here I am, just for you, girl
Million love songs later
Here I am
You might also likeI feel for you baby, I feel for you baby
A million love songs later
And here I, here I amEmbed
