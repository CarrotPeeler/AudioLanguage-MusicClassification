1 ContributorTurn Me Wild LyricsWhen I was young I stayed in line
I didn't do no midnight creeping
When I was young I stayed in line
I didn't do no midnight creeping
My mama had a broomstick beside the bed
Let me tell you it wasn't for sweeping
Didn't learn nothing from a book
No I never took a lesson
Didn't learn nothing from a book
No I never took a lesson
When it comes to the blues
I do my own kind of lesson
Blues done turn me wild
It's gone deep down in my soul
Blues done turn me wild
It's gone deep down in my soul
I get like an old hound dog
Playing on a rabbit's hole
You can't pick how they remember you
You just hope some day they do
You can't pick how they remember you
You just hope some day they do
But I still got more to say
I ain't never through
Blues done turn me wild
It's gone deep down in my soul
Blues done turn me wild
It's gone deep down in my soul
I get like an old hound dog
Playing on a rabbit's holeYou might also likeEmbed
