1 ContributorDead for You LyricsWhere can I find death for you
All of my hate for you
I'm so stupid, stupid, stupid
I can't trust you, I can't trust you
No no no no no
I don't trust you, I can't trust you
I'm only waiting for love
Little stupid fool girl
And you don't understand
La, la, la, la
Now you are resting in hell
And I miss you again
Little vertical girl
La, la, la, la
After I kill you
What should I do?
All of those dark days for you
I'm so happy, stupid happy
I have done it
I just did it
I have done it
I just did it
You might also likeI'm only waiting for love
Little stupid fool girl
And you don't understand
La, la, la, la
Now you are resting in hell
And I miss you again
Little vertical girl
La, la, la, la
I'm only waiting for love
Little stupid fool girl
And you don't under
I'm only waiting for love
Little stupid fool girl
And you don't under
I'm only waiting for love
Little stupid fool girl
And you don't under
I'm only waiting for love
Little stupid fool girl
And you don't understand
Death for you Embed
