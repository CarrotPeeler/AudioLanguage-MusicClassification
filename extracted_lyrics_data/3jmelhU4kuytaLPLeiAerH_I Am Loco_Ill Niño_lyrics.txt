8 ContributorsI Am Loco Lyrics
Life is weighing down on me, killing me inside
Something I could never be will guide me to the new light
Frustrated, sedated, I pray to myself
God, please, don't take away from me
The only fucking thing that I learned to believe
I am becoming the monster you promised to keep him away
Now I feel like he's living in me

Anyway, I could never, ever be
What you think is right for me
Are things that I will not believe
I want to start a new life
Get myself a sharp knife
Look into my own life
Kill things I don't like in me
But sometimes I feel okay
And think I'm unique
You always try to critique
I turn my back on it anyway
Sucker! Punk-ass motherfucker
I am loco, te falta un poco
To get your ass in a choke-hold

Just kill me, I can't breathe
I am guiding myself right to the end
I can't learn, come to terms
With the sickness that makes me crash and burn
You might also like
I'm crying I feel like I am dying but I'm trying
I beg to myself, put my pride up on the shelf
Life is not forever
But if life will stay together
I would have a friend in my depression, have an end
But I've been thinking
And thinking always gets me into trouble
But since I have a double personality
It wasn't me, you see?
Now I'm a refugee
And everything inside of me
Is just a part of my disease

Just kill me, I can't breathe
I am guiding myself right to the end
I can't learn, come to terms
With the sickness that makes me crash and burn
Just kill me, I can't breathe
I am guiding myself right to the end
I can't learn, come to terms
With the sickness that makes me crash and burnEmbed
