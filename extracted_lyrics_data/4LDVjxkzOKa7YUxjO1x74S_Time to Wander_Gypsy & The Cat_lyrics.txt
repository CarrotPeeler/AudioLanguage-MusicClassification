4 ContributorsTime to Wander LyricsFalling through a simple world
Nothing here to call my own
Searching on for something sweet to savour
I'm parting seas away from view
When it's time to walk a line I'll find a destiny
I'm free from time I've lost my mind
Goodbye now don't wave to me
Time to wander
Now I'm gone never here
When you look nothing near
Will you wonder
Now I'm gone never here
When you look nothing near
And I wonder I wonder
Rolling through the rocky bend
Will the journey ever end
Try'na find the missing puzzle under
Thunderclouds and desert streets
When you fly a lonely sky the view is far too sweet
I'm like a bird I sing from hurt
Spread your wings and glide to me
Time to wander
Now I'm gone never here
When you look nothing near
Will you wonder
Now I'm gone never here
When you look nothing near
And I wonder I wonder
You might also likeTime to wander
Now I'm gone never here
When you look nothing near
Will you wonder
Now I'm gone never here
When you look nothing near
And I wonder I wonder
Will you wonder
Now I'm gone never here
When you look nothing near
And I wonder I wonder1Embed
