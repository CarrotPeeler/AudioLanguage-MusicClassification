There’s a message that I’m longing to know
Something hidden in the walls of your life
Fast rider made of blood, made of bone
To a door that’s only open in the night
What I’m looking for’s elusive and fine
The door is open and I know where

Babe I’m in the cold air
Cold heart
Singular and true
And my new friends ride hard
We meet under the moon
Babe I’m in the cold air
Cold heart
Singular and true
And my new friends ride hard
We meet under the moon

Driving solo in the fastеst of cars
Send a message on an iPhonе ten
This morning in the Summit waiting for a call
Tonight I’m meeting with my partner again
I found a way to be forever and more
I’m going to make myself immortal
You might also like
Tonight I’m going to head down
Straight down to the Summit’s edge
Reach out my hand, here am I again
Going to head down
Straight down to the Summit’s edge
Reach out my hand, here am I again

Still the shadow knows the way into my heart
No one really knows me when it’s there
But you can see the changing in my eyes
You can feel the shining of the moon

The road I’m on is pastoral and dark
You can feel the stillness in the air
I will ride steady to the end of the world
I don’t care if it takes forever and more

The coven’s meeting down at Jack’s, we start at 8
Sydney leads the way, I hardly say a word
I just want to know there’s more to this pain
Didn’t expect to see the crashing of worlds
I just want to know that magic’s alive
Our assembly is impatient
Still we travel safely baby
To the other side, where a new world awaits me
Baby I’m alive
In the cold air
Cold heart
Singular and true
And my new friends ride hard
We meet under the moon

The road I’m on is pastoral and dark
You can feel the stillness in the air
I will ride steady to the end of the world
I don’t care if it takes forever and moreEmbed
