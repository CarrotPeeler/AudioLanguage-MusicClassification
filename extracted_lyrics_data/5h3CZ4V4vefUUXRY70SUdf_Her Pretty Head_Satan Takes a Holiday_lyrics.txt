1 ContributorHer Pretty Head LyricsPretty boy pretty boy
You've got a kissable mouth
I got one for you
Before you go south
I got a pocket full of money
I got holes in my shoes
I'm gonna call you honey
I'm gonna buy you booze
I take my hat off
To take your head off
I take it off for you
That's how it goes
That's how it goes
I'm taking heads for leverage
That's how it goes
What's in the box?
Your pretty little head
Do you feel you've been charmed?
You've been tricked to fall?
Got an arm for a leg?
You got no head at all?
I take my hat off
To take your head off
I take it off for you
That's how it goes
That's just how it goes
I'm taking heads for leverage
That's how it goes
What's in the box
Your pretty little headYou might also likeEmbed
