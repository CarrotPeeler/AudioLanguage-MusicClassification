18 ContributorsWithin the Mind Lyrics
Transforming your mind from the inside out
Overcoming fear that made you doubt
Observing what is stored in the subconscious
Trusting what you feel with your gut response

See past the dark
And use your energy
Learn from these images
Thoughts that we call dreams
Ooh-whoa!

This power lies within the mind
Gain wisdom through abilities
Change what's to come in future time
Avoiding pain and misery


Look through the fake from what is real
Making decisions by what you feel
Live for the future and not the past
The weak of mind will never last
You might also like
Perceiving visions that reoccur
Analyse your dreams to gain
A better perspective of your life
In control of your destiny with mind and soul

See past the dark
And use your energy
Learn from these images
Thoughts that we call dreams
Ooh-whoa!

This power lies within the mind
Gain wisdom through abilities
Change what's to come in future time
Avoiding pain and misery
