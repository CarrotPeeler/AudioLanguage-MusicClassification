3 ContributorsI Canâ€™t Help Myself LyricsIf I would tell you
How much you mean to me
I think you wouldn't understand it
So I wait, I wait
Until this day comes
When you will understand me
But I can't help myself
I can't stop myself
I am going crazy
And I can't stop myself
I cannot control myself
I am going crazy
And I love
I want you
I wanna talk to you
I wanna be with you
And I love you
And I want you
I wanna talk to you
I wanna be with you
I cannot change it
I'm sure not making it
One big hell of a fuss
I cannot turn my back
I've got to face the fact
Life without you is hazy
You might also likeAnd I love
I want you
I wanna talk to you
I wanna be with you
And I love you
And I want you
I wanna talk to you
I wanna be with you
Kiss me thrill me don't say goodbye
Hold me love me don't say goodbye
Oh oh oh don't say goodbye
But I can't help myself
I can't stop myself
I am going crazy
I cannot turn my back
I've got to face the fact
Life without you is hazy
And I love
I want you
I wanna talk to you
I wanna be with you
And I love you
And I want you
I wanna talk to you
I wanna be with you
Kiss me goodbyeEmbed
