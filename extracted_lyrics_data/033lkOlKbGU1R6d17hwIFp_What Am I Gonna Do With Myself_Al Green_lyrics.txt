3 ContributorsWhat Am I Gonna Do With Myself LyricsYou're gone but love love is still here baby
You're making each day seem like a year
Baby baby loneliness has got me uptight
There ain't a sign of happiness in sight
Now now now what am I gonna do with myself
I wanna know wanna know wanna know right now
I can't I tried it and I can't love nobody else
Now baby baby baby yeah yeah
Each night I toss oh baby turn in my bed
I cry cry cry so much baby till my eyes are all red
Without you something existed you got everything my heart is missing
Tell me baby
What lord lord am I gonna do with myself
I wanna know wanna know wanna know right now
I can't baby can't love nobody else
Cause I tried and tried baby
No no
Baby calling
Baby everything my heart desires
But now what somebody somebody help me baby baby babyYou might also likeEmbed
