3 ContributorsThanks for the Memory LyricsThanks for the memory
Of sentimental verse and nothing in my purse
And chuckles when the preacher said: For better or for worse
How lovely it was
Thanks for the memory
Of rainy afternoons, ...
How ... burning toast and prunes
How lovely it was!
We said goodbye with a highball
Then I got as high as a steeple
But we were intelligent people
No tears, no fuss
Hooray for us
So thanks for the memory
Of sunburns at the shore, darling, how are you?
You might have been a headache but you never were a bore
... glad I met you, cheerio and to ... you so muchYou might also likeEmbed
