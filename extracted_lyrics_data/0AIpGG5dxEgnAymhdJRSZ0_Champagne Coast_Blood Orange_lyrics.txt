27 ContributorsChampagne Coast Lyrics
Finishing eight or nine?
Tell me, what's the perfect time?
Told you I'll be waiting
Hiding from the rainfall

Come into my bedroom
Come into my bedroom
Come into my bedroom
Come into my bedroom

Tell me, what's the joy of giving if you're never pleased?
On my last strength against all that you believed

Come into my bedroom
Come into my bedroom
Come into my bedroom
Come into my bedroom

Young as I want to know
I'll never let you go
Trading a baseball lover as I face the snow
You might also like
Come into my bedroom
Come into my bedroom
Come into my bedroom
Come into my bedroom

Finishing eight or nine?
Tell me, what's the perfect time?
I told you I'll be waiting
Hiding from the rainfall
Tell me, what's the joy of giving if you're never pleased?
On my last strength against you
Baby, tell me what you need
Young as I want to know
I will never let you go
Trading a baseball lover as I face the snow
So, tell me, what's the joy of giving if you're never pleased?
On my last strength against you
Baby, tell me what you need

Finishing eight or nine?
Tell me, what's the perfect time?
I told you I'll be waiting
Hiding from the rainfall
So, tell me, what's the joy of giving if you're never pleased?
On my last strength against you
Baby, tell me what you need
Young as I want to know
I will never let you go
Trading a baseball lover as I face the snow
So, tell me, what's the joy of giving if you're never pleased?
On my last strength against you
Baby, tell me what you need
Finishing eight or nine? (Young as I want to know, I will never let you go)
Tell me, what's the perfect time?
I told you I'll be waiting
Hiding from the rainfall
So, tell me, what's the joy of giving if you're never pleased? (Trading a baseball lover as I face the snow)
On my last strength against you
Baby, tell me what you need
Young as I want to know
I will never let you go
Trading a baseball lover as I face the snow
So, tell me, what's the joy of giving if you're never pleased?
On my last strength against you
Baby, tell me what you need15Embed
