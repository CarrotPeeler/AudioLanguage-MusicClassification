No woman no cry
No woman no cry
No woman no cry
No woman no cry

Cause I remember when we used to sit
In a government yard in Trenchtown
Observing the hypocrites
Mingle with the good people we meet, yeah

Good friends we have now, good friends we've lost
Along the way
In this great future, you can't forget your past
So dry your tears, I say, yeah

No woman no cry
No woman no cry
Oh little darling, don't shed no tears
No woman no cry

Cause I remember when we used to sit
In a government yard in Trenchtown
When Georgie would make the fire lights
I say, log would be burnin' through the nights, yeah
See BoneyÂ M. LiveGet tickets as low as $32You might also like
Then we would cook cornmeal porridge (alright)
Of which I'd share with you
My feet is my only carriage
So I've got to push on through, and while I'm gone

Everything's gonna be alright
Everything's gonna be alright
Everything's gonna be alright now (cause I'll tell you)
Everything's gonna be alright (alright)
Everything's gonna be alright now (cause I'll tell you)
Everything's gonna be alright
No woman no cry

No woman no cry
No woman no cry
No woman no cry
No woman no cry
Oh little darling, don't shed no tears
No woman no cry
Oh little darling, don't shed no tears
No woman no cry, yeah

Said I re-, said I re-, said I remember
No woman no cry
You and I and you and I and you and I and you and I
No woman no cry
Cause I remember when we used to sit there
No woman no cry
In a government yard
No woman no cry
No woman no cry
No woman no cry, yeah
No woman no cry
No woman no cry (you sweet darling)
No woman no cry
No woman no cry, yeah
No woman no cry
No woman no cry, yeah
No woman no cry
No woman no cryEmbed
