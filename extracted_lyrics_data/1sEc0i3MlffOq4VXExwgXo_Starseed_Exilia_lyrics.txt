Intoxicated by your sacred words
And I'm nothing
She took that step she never knew
No dreams came true and now she is gone
And I'm nothing, I'm nothing
Can do nothing in this tragedy
Where are you?
No answer
I'm lost in disaster
I cross myself and tell you
I'm nothing once again
I'm nothing once again
She died alone before her time
A starseed lost in this world of mine
Don't want to talk
Don't want your love
It's my conclusion in this spiral of words
And I'm nothing, I'm nothing
Can do nothing in this tragedy
Where are you?
No answer
I'm lost in disaster
I cross myself and tell you
I'm nothing once again
I'm nothing once again
You might also likeLast rites
Candles
I need
An answer
She danced
She walked
She loved
This world
She danced
She walked
She left
This world
And I'm nothing
Can do nothing, nothing in this tragedy
Where are you?
No answer
I'm lost in disaster
I cross myself and tell you
I'm nothing once again
Where are you?
No answer
I'm lost in disaster
I cross myself and tell you that
I'm nothing once again
I'm nothing once again
I'm nothing, nothing, nothingEmbed
