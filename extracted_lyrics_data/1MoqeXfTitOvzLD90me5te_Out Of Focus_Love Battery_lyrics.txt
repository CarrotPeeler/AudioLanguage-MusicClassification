4 ContributorsOut Of Focus Lyrics
You take my world and tear it apart
I can't believe what I've done
Put my pride in a mess
I can't stand it when you wear that dress
Don't like the things you say
Why don't you just go away?
I've been diggin' for two lights
I've been diggin' for July

It rings around in reasons sweet
Inside your mind in the summer heat
I can't believe the things I say
Between your eyes, between your legs
The words, they flail and break in half
They make you mad, they make you laugh
Let me crawl into the scene
The endless rhythm into your

Your dreams that are out of focus
Knock you up when you're feeling down
All the world seems so unreal

Why should I lean on the street
In shadows cast for sympathy?
Serves on your hands and knees
I can't believe, I can't believe
Now that my patience is slim
When summer comes, I'll take it in
Not if my pain could swim
And drown it in the words it brings
You might also like
Your dreams that are out of focus
Knock you up when you're feeling down
All the world seems so unrealEmbed
