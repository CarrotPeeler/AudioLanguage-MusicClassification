2 ContributorsSanctum Lyrics
I’m flipping through Bible Pages
I’m Looking for something Inside to save me
Anything about endurance And having faith in a deity
Anything about descriptions Of Jesus’ face in them Paintings
There’s a Cloth with the blood pattern of his face when he stained it?
Absent-minded in Sunday school
And now whenever Producers ask me when
I’mma have the time to voice, I say Sunday’s cool
Don’t get me wrong, God is first
But I’m beginning to think
That he lives inside of us
And not in church
Tunde’s papa died, and that tortured him
Mine alive; are you saying I go to mass more than him
Y’all make it look like the size Of your cash offering
Bought a one way ticket to heaven, flying past all the Sinners
No heresy, no blasphemy, just an awesome thinker
With a computer mind, and the rhymes go through that Colour printer
And so the picture vivid, Every pixel in it
This is truth but I ain’t tryna replace the scriptures with it
Just Listen. Chill my nigga just listen
I find peace in my inner Sanctum
I look for God and then I Thank him; for this

Happy day
Oh happy day
Oh happy day
Oh happy day

My name is Musa and I’m a Muslim
Been pushing to marry Mary;
My parents think it’s some bullshit
What will your kids do? Go to church and take communion
Or go to mosque for prayers and always do ablution
I just wish they would be Open-minded
Her parents too; I hope they find it
In their hearts to let us tie the
Knot Or we just might elope and tie it
I was the one who broke her hymen
What if I wrote and signed it
On that piece of paper? Peace you haters
It feels like we been released from cages
She got the keys to her father’s jeep, we’ll take it
And then speed away, until we reach a place where
Nobody cares about your method of worship
And every pastor just a regular person
No jets in his purchase
And every celebrity cares
More about the lives he touches
And not about the bottles he popping, and dimes he fucking
Not only concerned about the swag
Walking with a limp; somebody have the doctor
Prescribe some crutches
Imagine me being tired of rapping
Ain’t getting paid
All these people do is admire my actions
Imagine ‘em calling me a Legend
Or comparing me to ‘em after this
But I ain’t hearing ‘em from Inside of my casket
Took my time chasing Greatness
I desire it faster
Got the fire, the passion
If I just happen To drop an album
Would you buy it in traffic Or drive and pass it?
Would your answer be the same if I die in a crash
And have these suckers saying my mixtape was entirely classic?
Y'all returning the love when the recipient absent
She be talkin’ ‘bout she misses me
But stupid this me make the most of all this
Quality time while we have it
They like “No, Boogey, please you not leaving Hiphop
Around here will prolly die the day you stop breathing
You gotta be patient. They will relate in due time
They will catch up to your pace as mediocrity declines”
Aight, I’ll think about it
Damn, I just thought about it
Half these niggas get talked about, after their coffins grounded
How about it. Right on the grave
A lonely Flower sprouted
A fruit of my inner sanctum I’ll find God thank him for this
