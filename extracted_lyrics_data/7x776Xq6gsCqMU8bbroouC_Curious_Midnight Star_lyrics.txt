Hi Melvin
Hey baby, how you doin today?

I really gotta have you
'Cause what my body feels I can't take away
And you, you're so exciting
That you take my breath away

So get ready
And let me love you
I've got the answer
Right here beside me, girl
Love is a gamble, I wanna take with you
I wanna win girl, so let me know what's on your mind

(I'm curious) About your lovin'
(I'm curious) I wanna know what's on your mind
(I'm curious) About your lovin', girl
(I'm curious) I wanna know what's on your mind

We should get it together
'Cause right now, girl, this feeling's strong
And I'm anticipating
I wanna know what turns you on
You might also like
Lovely lady, hear my intentions
I'd like to have ya
Right here beside me, girl
Love is a gamble, I wanna take with you
I wanna win girl, so let me know what's on your mind

(I'm curious) About your lovin'
(I'm curious) I wanna know what's on your mind
(I'm curious) About your lovin', girl
(I'm curious) I wanna know what's on your mind

Lovely lady, hear my intentions
I've got the answer
Right here beside me, girl
Love is a gamble I wanna take with you
I wanna win girl, so let me know what's on your mind

(I'm curious) About your lovin'
(I'm curious) I wanna know what's on your mind
(I'm curious) About your lovin', girl
(I'm curious) I wanna know what's on your mind
(I'm curious) Curiosity never hurt nobody
See (I'm curious) I'm curious
(I'm curious) Curiosity never hurt nobody
(I'm curious) I'm curious
(I'm curious) Did you hear about what it did to the cat, satisfaction sure brought it back (I'm curious)
Oooh, nine times baby
(I'm curious) Don't you do me like that
I need your lovin' that's a fact (I'm curious)
Whoo! I wanna know what's on your mind (I'm curious)
(I'm curious) Yeah

Curiosity never hurt nobody
Curiosity never hurt nobody
