5 ContributorsLucky Love Lyrics
Life is a paradise
Whoa, whoa, yeah

Lucky love belongs in teenage heaven
I know, I know
'Cause I've been there with you tonight
Lucky love belongs in teenage heaven
I know, I know
'Cause I've been there with you tonight

I believe life could be paradise once again (Again, again, again)
And the love we thought we lost is sleeping within
Close your eyes, it's something for you

Lucky love belongs in teenage heaven
I know, I know
'Cause I've been there with you tonight
Lucky love belongs in teenage heaven
I know, I know
I'm a prisoner of hope, I know

We are young and we are old
We're fallin' like leaves (Like leaves, like leaves, like leaves)
And your heart's so full of soul
It makes me believe
Once again, it's something for you
You might also like
Lucky love belongs in teenage heaven
I know, I know
'Cause I've been there with you tonight
Lucky love belongs in teenage heaven
I know, I know

A bridge over time
Was what you need to see the light
To see the light
Oh, yeah!

Lucky love, lucky love
Lucky love belongs in teenage heaven
Lucky love, lucky love
Lucky love belongs in teenage heaven
Whoa, whoa, yeah
Lucky love belongs in teenage heaven
I know, I know
'Cause I've been there with you tonight
Lucky love belongs in teenage heaven
I know, I know
I'm a prisoner of hope, I know1Embed
