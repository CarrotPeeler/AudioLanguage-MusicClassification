1 Contributoroutro (THERAPY) Lyrics
After all this time
I still found myself in total misbelief
The remnant poisonous thoughts that leave my word without much value
I guess I'm still learning, and so are you
But there is this one thing I've realised throughout my journey (Therapy)
It's just like he said (Daydream therapy)
"Happiness is in fact only real when shared" - so is my daydream therapy (Therapy)
Thank you for all (Therapy)
(This is daydream therapy)
(This is daydream therapy)
(Daydream therapy)
(This is therapy)
(This is therapy)
This is therapyEmbed
