3 ContributorsIt Wouldnâ€™t Be Christmas LyricsWe hang the lights, have snowball fights
And sing our favorite tunes
All of these are memories
I make each year with you
We decorate the douglas together
And watch "It's A Wonderful Life"
I look forward to every December
Because you're always here by my side
It wouldn't be Christmas without you
The season would just come and go
The holiday cheer would all disappear
Along with the sleigh bells and snow
Santa and eight little reindeer
Might as well pass on through
'Cause baby it wouldn't be Christmas
Without youYou might also likeEmbed
