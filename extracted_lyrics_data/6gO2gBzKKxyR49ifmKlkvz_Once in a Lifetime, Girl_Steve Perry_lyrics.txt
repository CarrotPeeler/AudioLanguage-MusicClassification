Did I tell you when, did I tell you how
You turn my world? I'm gonna tell you now
You took my heart, you gave me yours
No love for me I never felt before, you're my

Baby, baby
Oh, baby, baby

Do you wanna go? Do you wanna hear?
Do you wanna stay? Ooh, I love you, dear
So I ain't goin' lyin', I wouldn't lie to you
Believe me, baby, you know it's true
I wanna keep you loving on me
Oh, so everyone can see that you're my

Baby, baby
Oh, baby, baby
Oh

Once in a lifetime, girl
Once in a lifetime, girl
Once in a lifetime, girl
You might also like
Hold on me, baby, just like you are
Hold on me tight or I might stumble and fall
Your love is so hard to endure
Don't need no doctor 'cause there ain't no cure

Once in a lifetime, girl
Once in a lifetime, girl
Once in a lifetime, girl
Once in a lifetime, girl

Once in a lifetime, girl
Once in a lifetime, girl
Once in a lifetime, girl, yeah, hey

Baby, so come on, let's do it again
More than a lover, you're more than a friend
Baby, I'm always wherever you are
Don't hide your feelings, don't wander too far
Baby, so come on, let's do it again
You're more than a lover, more than a friend
Baby, I'm always wherever you are
Don't hide your feelings, you'll wander too far
Baby, so come on, let's do it againEmbed
