1 ContributorShake Your Magnolia LyricsI been around the block once or twice, baby
I never seen a girl lookin’ so nice, baby
I guess the third time makes me a fool
Just like the boys in the corner
Tryin’ to look so cool
You look like trouble with a capital T, baby
Your kind of drama is alright with me, baby
You can make a mess of me so fine
Yea you got me bait, hook, sinker and line

Come on baby shake your magnolia
Come on baby do what I told ya
Come on baby give it all you got tonight
I would walk through flames to get to you, baby
You shook that thang I forgot my own name, baby
I guess I’ll have to stand in line
If it takes all night I’ll give you my last dime

Come on baby shake your magnolia
Come on baby do what mama told ya
Come on baby give us all a shot tonightSee Blackberry Smoke LiveGet tickets as low as $38You might also likeEmbed
