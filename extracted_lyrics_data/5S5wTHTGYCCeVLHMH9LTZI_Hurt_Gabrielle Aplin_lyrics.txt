5 ContributorsHurt Lyrics
I shiver when you touch my skin
And I know without asking
You’re right there where you wanna be
You’re right here in front of me
And you talk about travelling
Where we’ll go and where we’ve been
But this thing you’re building now
All I see is it coming down, oh

You are so good, I know that this is gonna hurt
I don’t think we should, you know it’s never gonna work
There’s things that you can’t see
You’re way too close to me
This one is gonna hurt
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, this one is gonna hurt
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

You feel cold in the summer sun
Leaves fall and the winter comes
Why does it take us by surprise?
It’s been the story all our lives, oh
The more you know, the less you learn
What goes unsaid, doesn’t go unheard
If only I could help us both
Can't run away from where we're going
You might also like
You are so good, I know that this is gonna hurt
I don’t think we should, you know it’s never gonna work
There’s things that you can’t see
You’re way too close to me
This one is gonna hurt
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, this one is gonna hurt
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

You are so good
I know that this is gonna hurt
I don’t think we should
I know it’s never gonna work, oh
You are so good, I know that this is gonna hurt
I don’t think we should, you know it’s never gonna work
There’s things that you can’t see
You’re way too close to me
This one is gonna hurt
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, this one is gonna hurt
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
This one is gonna hurt1Embed
