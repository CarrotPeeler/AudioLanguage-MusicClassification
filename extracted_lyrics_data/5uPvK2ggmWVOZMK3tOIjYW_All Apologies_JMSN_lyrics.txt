3 ContributorsAll Apologies Lyrics
Sooner or later everybody's gotta leave
And it ain't about nothin no
It's just a harsh reality
I know you're probably thinking
No, that's not the way it's gotta be
Depends on how you take it though
Cause this could all just be a dream
Sometimes it seems that this could last forever
But no, not me
Im gonna find something better than...

You
See, it was never up to me
All apologies

Sooner or later everybody's feelings start to change
You start to get a vision of your soul inside a cage
The outside's nice, but its dark at the center
And all my life I wanted to do better than...


It's time to wake up
Cause I'm not enough for...
You
It was never up to me
