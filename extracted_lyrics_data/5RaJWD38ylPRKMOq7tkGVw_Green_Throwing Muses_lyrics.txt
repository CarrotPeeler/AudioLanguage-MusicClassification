Then there were candles
And a phoenix burned my bed
These are subwords
These are air
There's one boy
In one house
In one place
At all times
And green eyes
I got no more
Who are you for?
I got no more
What is this?
I shouldn't be smoking
This last cigarette
I feel sick
Now there are words in my head
You took my house
Burned it inside out
Kneel in my ashes
Kneading them

In one house
In one place
At all times
And green eyes
I got no more
Who are you for?
I got no more
What is this?
And now you're leaving again, no
Temper and tempest
To knock at the moon
And the stars come out at night
What's that beyond the floor?
You were left screaming
My hands are in your hair
You have the deepest eyes
You built a city in my head
Where are your candles? (...you can see my...)
And a phoenix that was you in my bed
These are subwords
These are air (Turning my body around)
There's one boy
In one house
In one place
At all times (There's one boy)
And green eyes
I got no more
Who are you for?
I got no more
What is this?
Smoke falls to the ceiling
It begins
There's a man dancing at me
He's making circles
So I will tell you now
(I wear your clothes) I wear your clothes like armour
(I love your face) I love your face like God
So you're in love and I'm indebted always
Green eyes
And now you're leaving again
No...Embed
