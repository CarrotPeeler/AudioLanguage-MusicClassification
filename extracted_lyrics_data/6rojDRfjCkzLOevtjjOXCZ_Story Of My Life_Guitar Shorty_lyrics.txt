3 ContributorsStory of My Life Lyrics
Mm-mm, mm-mm-mm
Oh-oh, oh, oh

If my mother had not died
Lord, and my father left his child at home
If my mother had not died
Lord, and my father left his child at home
Maybe my life wouldn't be so miserable, baby
Lord, and I wouldn't be so all alone

I was born in Alabama
Lord, and I was raised up in Tennessee
I was born in Alabama
Lord, and I was raised up in Tennessee
But no matter where I travel
Someone have always tried to hurt poor me


Well, I'd rather be lyin' dead
Sleepin' way down in my grave
Lord, and live on in this sorrow
Well, and misery every dayYou might also likeEmbed
