1 ContributorThatâ€™s Alright Lyrics
You told me, baby, once upon a time
If I'd be yours, little boy, you'd be mine

But that's alright
I know you love another girl but that's alright
Well, sometimes I wonder who's lovin' you tonight

You told me, baby, your love for me was strong
When I woke up this morning, all your big words had gone

But that's alright
I know you love another girl but that's alright
Sometimes I wonder who's lovin' you tonight

When I was lovin' you, you just couldn't understand
You gone and left me here without a man

But that's alright
I know you love another girl but that's alright
Sometimes I wonder who's lovin' you tonight
You might also like

You told me, baby, once upon a time
If I'd be yours, little boy, you'd be mine

But that's alright
I know you love another girl but that's alright
Sometimes I wonder who's lovin' you tonight

Oh yeahEmbed
