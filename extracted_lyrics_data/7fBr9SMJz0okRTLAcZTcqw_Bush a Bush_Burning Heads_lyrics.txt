1 ContributorBush A Bush LyricsTrading flesh for oil
You don't give a damn
We don't need your war
And we'll say it loud
Put this shit out
Of your head
Tell your puppets
Not to hate
Stop the madness
Before it's too late
If dad need's a war
Smash his face
Put this smile out
Of your face
Teach your dog
Not to biteYou might also likeEmbed
