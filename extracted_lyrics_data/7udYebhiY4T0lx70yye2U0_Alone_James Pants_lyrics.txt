1 ContributorFloating Eloy | Baby James Lyrics

Baby James, don't leave me haning on the line
I knew you went, you had no one to talk to
Now you're moving in our society
Don't froget I'm no secret about you

When I give my heart again
I know, it's gonna last forever
No one tell where I went
I know, it's gonna last forever
*panting*

Baby James, don't it make you feel sad
Just when I thought that we were winning
You and I were so close in every way
Don't time fly when you're loving and laughing

When I give my heart again
I know, it's gonna last forever
No one tell where I went
I know, it's gonna last forever
I won't be that young again
I know, it's gonna last forever
When I fall in love again
I know, it's gonna last forever
*panting*

Baby James, I've sat all alone to say
"Go your own way, don't think twice about me"
Cause I've got  and  off my own
So long, darling. I miss you, believe me

When I give my heart again
I know, it's gonna last forever
No one tell where I went
I know, it's gonna last forever
When I fall in love next time
I know, it's gonna last forever
I won't be that young again
I know, it will last forever


I could wait night and day
Say your name and I pray
In my heart night and day
'Til you come my way
I could wait night and day
Be the sky blue and gray
In my heart night and day
For you love to stay
Obsession
Obsession

You, got that magic in your eyes
Shining wherever you go
To a lover's paradise
Trusting that sign when I'm so

Close to where my heart belongs
Like in heaven

I could wait night and day
Say your name and I pray
In my heart night and day
'Til you come my way
I could wait night and day
Be the sky blue and gray
In my heart night and day
For you love to stay

Obsession
Obsession
[Verse 2}
I can't have fallen into a trance
Losing my sense again
You're my hero in advance
Trusting that sign when I'm so

Close to where my heart belongs
Like in heaven

I could wait night and day
Say your name and I pray
In my heart night and day
'Til you come my way
I could wait night and day
Be the sky blue and gray
In my heart night and day
For you love to stay

Obsession
Obsession
Obsession
Obsession

There ain't no promises
And no commitment
But how cruel can love be
How cruel to a broken heart like mine
There ain't no right, there ain't no wrong
But as my soul survivers
I set love

I could wait night and day
Say your name and I pray
In my heart night and day
'Til you come my way
I could wait night and day
Be the sky blue and gray
In my heart night and day
For you love to stay

Obsession
Obsession


Dizzy
I'm so dizzy, my head is spinning
Like a whirpool it never ends
And it's you boy making it spin
You're making me dizzy

First time that I saw you
Boy, I knew that I just had to make you mine
But it's so hard to talk to you
With fellows hanging 'round you all the time

I want you for my sweet 
But you keep playing hard to get
I'm going 'round in circles all the time

Dizzy
I'm so dizzy, my head is spinning
Like a whirpool it never ends
And it's you boy making it spin
You're making me dizzy

I finally got to talk to you
And told you just exactly how I felt
Then I held you close to me
And kissed you and my heart began to melt

Boy, you get control of me
'Cause I'm so dizzy I can't see
I need to call a doctor for some help

Dizzy
I'm so dizzy, my head is spinning
Like a whirpool it never ends
And it's you boy making it spin
You're making me dizzy
I'm so dizzy, my head is spinning
Like a whirpool it never ends
And it's you boy making it spin

You're making me dizzy
You're making me dizzy
I'm so dizzy


Give it to me, give it to me
All your love, all your love
Give it to me, give it to me
All your love, all your love
And don't go
You don't go
When you come, when you come
I'll be there, I'll be there
When you come, when you come
I'll be there, I'll be there
And don't go
Don't go
Darling I know, you come to me
I'll be there waiting, 
All that I want and all that I need
Someone to love me and someone...
Give it to me, give it to me
All your love, all your love
Give it to me, give it to me
All your love, all your love
And don't go
Don't go
When you come, when you come
I'll be there, I'll be there
When you come, when you come
I'll be there, I'll be there
And don't go
Don't go
Give it to me, give it to me
All your love, all your love
Give it to me, give it to me
All your love, all your love
Give it to me, give it to me
All your love, all your love
Give it to me, give it to me
All your love, all your love
And don't go
(Don't...)
Give it to me, give it to me
All your love, all your love
Give it to me, give it to me
All your love, all your love
Give it to me, give it to me
All your love, all your love
Give it to me, give it to me
All your love, all your love
Don't go
Don't go
Don't go
Don't go
Give it to me, give it to me
All your love, all your love
Give it to me, give it to me
All your love, all your love
Give it to me, give it to me
All your love, all your love
Give it to me, give it to me
All your love, all your love
And don't go
Don't go
Don't go
Give it to me, give it to me
All your love, all your love
Give it to me, give it to me
All your love, all your love
And don't go
Don't go
Don't go
Give it to me
Give it to me
Don't go
Don't go]Embed
