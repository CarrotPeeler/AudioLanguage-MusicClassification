1 ContributorManiacal Contempt Spawned From Agonizing Depravity LyricsInsanity
Weaving its web in my mind
Depravity
Tears me apart from inside
Contaminate
Hopelessness spreads like a plague
Eliminate
All that shall stand in my way
Gutting the child before me
Proves that my hate is for real
Draining its blood on my body
Soothes the contempt that I feel
Throw the infant in the fire
Watch it violently convulse
Stimulating my desire
Feasting on the charred remains
Maniacal contempts spawned from agonizing depravity
Infant is gone all of it devoured
Still not at peace must kill again
Stop the pain in my mind never ending
Pitiful whore mutilate drain her blood
Trickling down bathing in red
Butchered bitch lying there
Now I must feed
At peace again
But not for long
Burning inside
Tearing my soul
Spawned from years of dejection
Comes this need to desecrate
Never will I be at peace
Depravity consumes meYou might also likeEmbed
