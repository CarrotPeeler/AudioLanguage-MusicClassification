I love, and you love
We love, sweet love
I look and you look
And we found sweet love
And now we know

Love is the only thing that matters at all
After all

I kiss, and you kiss
Each kiss, sweet lips
I tease and you squeeze
And we find sweet bliss
That's how we know

Love is the only thing that matters at all
After all

I'm lucky
And you're lucky, too, uh-huh
We're lucky
And we know it's true
Love is so wonderful
You might also like
I give, and you give
We live, for love
Each night, each day
We love sweet love
'Cause ain't it so?

Love is the only thing that matters at all
After all, y'all
Love is the only thing that matters at all
After all, y'allEmbed
