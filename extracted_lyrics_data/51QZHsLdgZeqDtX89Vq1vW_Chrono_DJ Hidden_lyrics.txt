Hide and seek, I don’t play like that
Give it up, circle round the cul de sac
Off a E, I’m elated, I’m doing jumping jacks
In the cut clearing blister packs
I’m not damaged goods, boy I was made like that
Don’t get stuck turn him to an artifact
If we made a decision then it unfolds like that
On my heart it just goes like that

Brujas de canarias, ¿que coño me hablas de cabras?
Automakta ectoplasma con tu puta en la montaña
Mi savia en su cara, me la chupa en la cabaña
Babas en mis air max, esta shawty tiеne la rabia
Te ponemos dе rodillas (watch your head boy)
Si nos nombras, no te muevas, tranquilo que yo ya voy
Fumándome un mobydick en el pozo, aquí no hay tos
Vienes de enterado y te vuelves con una coz
Terroristas reventando tu altavoz
En mi cuello escondo clavos como un perro pastor
Rumores alrededor como si fuera Mia Goth
Mi cuerpo muerto en la presa junto a un puto castor
No hables de herramientas si no vas a disparar
La cizalla me combina con tu puta maxilar
Ese monstruo de mi espejo, no me deja de mirar
Escucho a los presidiarios, nunca paran de gritar

Hide and seek, I don’t play like that
Give it up, circle round the cul de sac
Off a E, I’m elated, I’m doing jumping jacks
In the cut clearing blister packs
I’m not damaged goods, boy I was made like that
Don’t get stuck turn him to an artifact
If we made a decision then it unfolds like that
On my heart it just goes like that

That’s how it goes
I was fucking hoes
Like my money
I could never fold
My hearts turning cold
All 80 mgs made me overheat
Down All 8 pills I overeat
No emotions I over E
Mollys no main bitch she was a treat
Burning through money
With a ghost overseas
Freaks on her knees
Thinks she loves me
I can’t love her back
I don’t work like that
I don’t like you like that
And I know you like that
I don’t care if you come back
I'ma tell you like that
Bitch fuck our future
Bodies in my past
Bloodlust for more
Body in a bag
Face from the front
Fuck her from the back
Ket in my nose
Ima horse not a man
Stance with my dicks
Different color money bags
Hide and seek, I don’t play like that
Give it up, circle round the cul de sac
Off a E, I’m elated, I’m doing jumping jacks
In the cut clearing blister packs
I’m not damaged goods, boy I was made like that
Don’t get stuck turn him to an artifact
If we made a decision then it unfolds like that
On my heart it just goes like that
Hide and seek, I don’t play like that
Give it up, circle round the cul de sac
Off a E, I’m elated, I’m doing jumping jacks
In the cut clearing blister packs
I’m not damaged goods, boy I was made like that
Don’t get stuck turn him to an artifact
If we made a decision then it unfolds like that
On my heart it just goes like that
