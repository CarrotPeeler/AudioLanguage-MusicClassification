Cha!

I'm on a sentimental journey into sight and sound
Of no return, and no lookin' back or down
A conscientious objector to the war that's in my mind
Oh, I'm leavin' in the lurch, and I'm takin' back what's mine

I'm on a mission into destination unknown
An expedition into Desolation Road
Where I'm a...

Castaway (Goin' at it alone)
Castaway (Now I'm on my own)
Castaway (Goin' at it alone)
Castaway (Now I'm on my own)

Lost and found
Trouble bound, castaway

I'm ridin' on the night train and drivin' stolen cars
Testin' my nerves out on the boulevard
Spontaneous combustion on the corners of my mind
Oh, I'm leavin' in the lurch, and I'm takin' back what's mine

Castaway (Goin' at it alone)
Castaway (Now I'm on my own)
Castaway (Goin' at it alone)
Castaway (Now I'm on my own)

Lost and found
Trouble bound, castaway


I'm on a sentimental journey into sight and sound
Of no return, and no lookin' back or down
A conscientious objector to the war that's in my mind
Oh, I'm leavin' in the lurch, and I'm takin' back what's mine

Castaway (Goin' at it alone)
Castaway (Now I'm on my own)

Trouble bound, castaway
