8 ContributorsChristmas Time Lyrics
Fa la la la la
Fa la la la la la la
Oh, hey

When I was young every Christmas Eve
I could not sleep
Trying to catch that old St. Nick
Leaving presents under my tree
And every year I'd fall asleep laying in my bed
Dreaming of a million sugarplums
Dancing in my head

Oh how much joy it is at Christmas time
The spirit of giving is in our lives, oh
Oh, how much joy it brings to see the ones you love
This year's going to be the best Christmas because

There'll be family and Christmas cheer (Oh)
Peace and goodwill to all men (Oh)
Everybody is home for Christmas
Everybody is home (Everybody is home)
Sneaking a kiss under the mistletoe
I want a white Christmas so let it snow (Let it snow)
Everybody is home for Christmas
Everybody is home, it's Christmas time
See Christina Aguilera LiveGet tickets as low as $64You might also like
Friends come together as we decorate the tree (Ah oh)
This is the time of year to live in harmony, oh
Angels watch over as we put the kids to sleep
(It's Christmas time)
And when they awake their smiling faces
Make it all complete, oh

This is the holiday you're with the family
We put aside our differences and let it be, oh
Oh, how much fun it is to give and to receive (To recieve)
This time of year, love is all we need oh

There'll be family (Family) and Christmas cheer oh
Peace and goodwill to all men
Everybody is home for Christmas
Everybody is home (Everybody is home, oh yeah)
Sneaking a kiss under the mistletoe
I want a white Christmas so let it snow
Everybody is home for Christmas
Everybody is home, it's Christmas time
(It's Christmas time)

Fa la la la la
Fa la la la la la la
Open your heart now
This is the time for us to give
The world needs love now
So live and let live, families all here
The spirit is good cheer, the sound of carolers
Ringing sweet in my ear, everything is all fine
You know why, it's Christmas time, what?

Oh how much joy it is at Christmas time
The spirit of giving is in our lives
Oh, oh how much joy it brings to see the one's you love (The one's you love)
This year's going to be the best Christmas because

There'll be family (Family) and Christmas cheer oh
Peace and goodwill to all men (Oh yeah)
Everybody is home for Christmas (Ooh)

Sneaking a kiss under the mistletoe (Mistletoe)
