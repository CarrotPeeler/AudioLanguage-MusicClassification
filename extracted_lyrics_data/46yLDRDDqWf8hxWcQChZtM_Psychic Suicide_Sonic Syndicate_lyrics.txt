5 ContributorsPsychic Suicide Lyrics
I recognized your scars
Because I have them, too
It cured my contamination
To speak of each other's misery
Can't deny that you were
A substitute of a greater loss
But after all, you reminded me of...

You're someone to the world
And you're the world for someone
You really think you have a future without me?
There's a place not far away
Where I want to take you
The first snowfall is always the whitest

Alone again in my broken dreams
What is love if not a psychic suicide?
Alone again in my restless dreams
Love is nothing but a psychic suicide

I recognized your scars
Because I have them, too
It cured my contamination
To speak of each other's misery
You might also like
I recall your face, because she wore it, too...
Well, you were nice
But I had no reason to fall in love again
So I said, “Thank you,”
Had enough with my own mind ghosts
But after all, you reminded me of...

Alone again in my broken dreams
What is love if not a psychic suicide?
Alone again in my restless dreams
Love is nothing but a psychic suicide

Well, I don’t care for you anymore
So, why don’t you fuck yourself?!

You're someone to the world
And you're the world for someone
You really think you have a future without me?
There's a place not far away
Where I want to take you
The first snowfall is always the whitest
Alone again in my broken dreams
What is love if not a psychic suicide?
Alone again in my restless dreams
Love is nothing but a psychic suicide

Alone again in the broken dreams of mine
What is love if not a psychic suicide?
Alone again in my restless dreams
