1 ContributorDo Right Woman, Do Right Man Lyrics
Take her to heart, she'll always love you
And nobody make her do wrong
Take her for granted, leavin' love unshown
Makes willpower weak, temptation strong

A woman's only human
You should understand
She's not just a plaything
She's flesh and blood just like a man

If you want a do right all day woman
You gotta be a do right all night man, yeah yeah

They say that it's a man's world
But honey, you can't prove that by me
And as long as we're together, baby
Show some respect for me

If you want a do right all days woman
You gotta be a do right all night man
You might also like
Woman's only human
This you should understand
She's not just a plaything
She's flesh and blood just like a man

If you want a do right all day woman
You gotta be a do right all night man
You gotta be a do right all night manEmbed
