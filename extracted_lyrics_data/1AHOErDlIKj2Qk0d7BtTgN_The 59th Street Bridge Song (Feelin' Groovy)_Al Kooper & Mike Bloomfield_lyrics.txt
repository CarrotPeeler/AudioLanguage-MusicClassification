Slow down, you're way too fast
You got to make, yeah, the mornin' last
Just kickin' down the cobblestones
Lookin' for fun, yeah, and feelin' groovy
Yeah, yeah, yeah, groovy

Hello lamppost, yeah, I wonder, what you knowin'?
I come to see the flowers growin'
Hey, ain't you got no rhymes for me?
Hey, alright now, I'm feelin' groovy
Well, I'm feelin' groovy


Slow down, you move too fast
You got to make, yeah, the mornin' last
Kickin' down the cobblestones
Lookin' for fun and feelin' groovy

I don't know how you feel
But I feel, I feel groovy, groovy, groovy
Well, I, yeah
Now come on
I feel pretty good
Come on
