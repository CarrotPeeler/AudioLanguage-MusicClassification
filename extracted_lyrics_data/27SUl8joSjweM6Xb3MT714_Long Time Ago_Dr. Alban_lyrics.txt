2 ContributorsLong Time Ago LyricsSuch a long time ago
(Like a fallen angel, you dropped right out of the blue)
The sun was shining bright
And everyone could see it
When you came walking in, I could hardly believe it
You wanna be my friend and always wanna love me
What about the things you do, is always gonna haunt me
Why you coming back again
(I wanna know)
Pretending that you're still my friend
(Making things so easy)
Why you coming back again
(This is for sure
'Cause this time I won't be the fool, you can leave me)
Such a long time ago
(Like a fallen angel, you dropped right out of the blue)
You have got a long way to go
(It's not always too late to mend what was broken back then)
Such a long time ago
(Like a fallen angel, you dropped right out of the blue)
You have got a long way to go
(Away, you know, away)

When you came walking in, I could hardly believe it
You wanna be my friend and always wanna love me
What about the things you do, is always gonna haunt meEmbed
