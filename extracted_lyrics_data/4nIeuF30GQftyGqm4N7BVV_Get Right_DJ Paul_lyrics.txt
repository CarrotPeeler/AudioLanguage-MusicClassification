20 ContributorsWhere’s da Bud Lyrics
Quickly, I reach for my chicken then I roll it up
Quickly, I reach for my chicken then I roll it up
Quickly, I reach for my chicken then I roll it up
Quickly, I reach for my chicken then I roll it up

I feel the need for the weed, the Smo-ko-king
They say the trees just for me
The B, The L, the U-N-T
The B, the, the, the U, the, the, the D
Oowee, give me shotgun
Oh please, oh please, no chicken feet
But chicken weed, pick out the seeds
The heat is hittin' me, many degrees, we gotta have it
Don't want to cabbage, we hate that babbage
Life savage, we, we, we, wanna, the Marijuana
Or we gonners, yo man I'm gonna, go 'round the corner
Get right on a ah, ah, ah, sack
I need contact, I need it bad, so I can mask
Just-just like that, go crank your 'Lac
We need to go, man, you move too slow
Take care of that, who got the hay, who got the hay?
Where do they stay?
Across the street, I'm goin' crazy lookin' for the ink
I'll take a quarter, fill it to the border of that mack
Where the bud at?
You might also like
Where is the bud? Where is the bud?
Where is the bud? Where is the bud?
Where is the bud? Where is the bud?
Where is the bud? Where is the bud?
Where is the bud? We lookin' for the bud
Where is the bud? We lookin' for the bud
Where is the bud? We lookin' for the bud

They call me Lord Infamous, but you can call me Scarecrow
I need me some red hair, chicken or some Indo
And I need a couple of quarts of somethin', so I can get full
We smokin' the ink, we get blowed off the ink
We get fucked up, we takin' them hard pulls
You'll get a wiff, when you sniff up in the air
We smoke bud anywhere, yeah, bitch, we don't care
'Cause when we get the urge to fire up some chronic, mane
A nigga must campaign, clouds up in the brain
Ooh, that chick-funk got me hype, homie, so hype, dawg
Blowin' so much bud, fool, chiefin', countin' suckers fall
This shit is burnin' too quick, fuck these little junts
Let's stroll to the store, get some cigars, roll some Philly blunts
Damn, fool, ain’t shit in the sack but some fuckin' shake
I need some more pure and I just can't fuckin' wait
Blac, let's go, where the bud at?
Let's go, where the bud at?
Let's go, where the bud at, mane?
Where is the bud? Where is the bud?
Where is the bud? Where is the bud?
Where is the bud? Where is the bud?
Where is the bud? Where is the bud?
Where is the bud? We lookin' for the bud
Where is the bud? We lookin' for the bud
Where is the bud? We lookin' for the bud
Where is the bud? Where is the bud?
Where is the bud? Where is the bud?
Where is the bud? Where is the bud?
Where is the bud? Where is the bud?
Where is the bud?

DJ Paul, he lookin' for the bud
Me, Lord Infamous I'm lookin' for the bud
The fuckin' Juice Manne, he lookin' for the bud
My nigga named Koop, he lookin' for the bud
Gangsta Boo, she lookin' for the bud
DJ Jus Borne, he lookin' for the bud
My nigga Crunchy Black, he lookin' for the bud
Triple 6 Mafia, we lookin' for the bud5Embed
