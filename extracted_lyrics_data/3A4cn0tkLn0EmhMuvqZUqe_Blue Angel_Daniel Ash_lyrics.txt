Just like you wouldn't believe
Voice floats through the air
Like a real good dream
In your world of illusion
She's your angel in blue
Just under six feet tall now
And she can sing the blues
Well, I never felt more like
Singing the blues
Well, I never felt more like
Singing the blues
Well, I never felt more like
Singing the blues
Well, I never felt more like
Singing the blues
She could dance
When she walked down the street
Seemed to float through the air
Like in a real good dream
And the loneliness she feel now
Now your on your knees
You might also likeAnd I never felt more like
Singing the blues
And I never felt more like
Singing the blues
Well, I never felt more like
Singing the blues
Well, I never felt more like
Singing the bluesEmbed
