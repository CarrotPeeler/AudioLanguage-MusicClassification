6 ContributorsThe House We Never Built Lyrics
I broke another glass
In the house we never built
The winter is always cold enough
Cold enough to kill

Just a little jasmine
Just a little salt in my wounds
What happens if I tell you
To tell the truth?

Tell me you love her
And I'll be gone
Tell me you love her
And my heart was simply wrong
Just say the words and I'll turn around
I'll be gone without a sound
And burn this house to the ground

It's like I never left
The house we never built
I broke another mirror
Now there's 21 years left
You might also like
Just a little bad luck
Just a little salt in my wounds
Break it to me gently, gently

Tell me you love her
And I'll be gone
Tell me you love her
And my heart was simply wrong
Just say the words and I'll turn around
I'll be gone without a sound
And burn this house to the ground
I'll burn it down

Feel the heat on my face
See it go up in flames
I'll burn it down
Burn it into the ground

Tell me you love her
And I'll be gone
Tell me you love her
And my heart was simply wrong
Just say the words and I'll turn around
I'll be gone without a sound
And burn this house to the ground1Embed
