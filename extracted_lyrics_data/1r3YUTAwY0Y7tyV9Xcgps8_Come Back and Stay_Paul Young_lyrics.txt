10 ContributorsCome Back and Stay Lyrics
Since you've been gone
I shut my eyes
And I fantasize that you're here with me
Will you ever return?
I won't be satisfied
'Til you're by my side
Don't wait any longer
(Come back)

Why don't you come back?
Please hurry
Why don't you come back?
Please hurry
Come back
And stay for good this time
(Did you write the book of love?)
Come back
And stay for good this time
(Ego, envy, lust)

When you said goodbye
I was trying to hide
What I felt inside
Until you passed me by
You might also likeYou said you'd return
You said that you'd be mine
'Til the end of time
But don't wait any longer
(Why don't you come back)


Since you've been gone
I opened my eyes
And I realize
What we had together
Will you ever return?
Or have you changed your mind
If you won't stay mine
Just love me forever
(Love me forever)

Why don't you come back?
Please hurry
Why don't you come back?
Please hurry
Why don't you come back?
Please hurry
Why don't you come back?
Please hurry
Just come back
And stay for good this time
(Did you write the book of love?)
Come back
And stay for good this time
(Ego, envy, lust)
Come back
And stay for good this time
(Did you write the book of love?)
Come back
And stay for good this time
(Ego, envy, lust)1Embed
