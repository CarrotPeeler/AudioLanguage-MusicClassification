5 ContributorsNo Deal Lyrics
Well no deal, you can't sell that stuff to me
Ah no deal, I'm going back to Tennessee

Now this man down at the used car lot
Tried to sell me four wheels and a trunk
I said, "But man, there ain't no engine!"
He said, "The engine's just a bunch of junk
You don't need no engine to go downhill
And I could plainly see
That that's the direction you're headed in"
And he handed me the keys

And I said no deal, you can't sell that stuff to me
Ah no deal, I'm going back to Tennessee

Well, I went to a doctor of the highest order
He said I couldn't have a drink for a year
One glass of wine on my birthday
If my birthday wasn't too very near
Lord, he must have put me in a state of shock
'Cause I made it for about two weeks
And then he sent me a bill that knocked me flat off the wagon
And back down on my feet
You might also like
Ah, I said no deal, you can't sell that stuff to me
Ah, no deal, I'm going back to Tennessee

Well when true love knocked upon my door
She just barely turned fifteen
And I was a little bit nervous
If you know just what I mean
But I'd heard somewhere that true love conquers all
And I figured that was that
Then I started having dreams about being chased out of town
Wearing nothing but my cowboy hat

And I said no deal, you can't sell that stuff to me
Ah, no deal, I'm going back to Tennessee

Well, I come through this life a stumbler, friends
I expect to die that way
Ah it could be twenty years from now
Could be most any day
But if there ain't no whiskey and women, Lord
Behind them heavenly doors
I'm gonna take my chances down below
And of that you can be sure
Ah, it's no deal, you can't sell that stuff to me
Ah, no deal, I'm going back to Tennessee
And it's no deal, you can't sell that stuff to me
Ah, no deal, I'm going back to TennesseeEmbed
