Hey

Took me to waters blue
Colored in a way I never knew
Swimming in a paradise with you
But your face is still my favorite view
I got the big, big feels (Big, big feels)
Pinch me to know you're real (Know you're real)
You're not a ninety-nine
One hundred all the time

Terrified to start again
Then you pull me in, pull me in

I see you (Hey)
Doin' all of the things you do (Hey)
Showin' off with the way you move
I should give you a medal
Gold on another level (Hey)
Let me be your

Stay runnin' 'round my mind
Doing so many laps, aren't you tired?
The things that you do, I can't define
You leave me so tongue-tied
And I got the big, big feels (Big, big feels)
Pinch me to know you're real (Know you're real)
You're not a ninety-nine
You're one hundred all the time
You might also like
Terrified to start again
Then you pull me in, pull me in

I see you (Hey)
Doin' all of the things you do (Hey)
Showin' off with the way you move
I should give you a medal
Gold on another level (Hey)
Let me be your muse
(Wanna be, wanna be, wanna be your)
Muse
(Wanna be, wanna be, wanna be your)
Muse
I should give you a medal
Gold on another level
(Let me be your)

(Hey)
Let's go on the run
(Hey)
I'll be your shotgun
Let's go everywhere under the sun
Sounds crazy, but I think you're the one
I see you (Hey)
Doin' all of the things you do (Hey)
Showin' off with the way you move
I should give you a medal
Gold on another level
Let me be your muse
(Wanna be, wanna be, wanna be your)
Muse
(Wanna be, wanna be, wanna be your)
Muse
I should give you a medal
Gold on another level
Let me be your
Let me be yourEmbed
