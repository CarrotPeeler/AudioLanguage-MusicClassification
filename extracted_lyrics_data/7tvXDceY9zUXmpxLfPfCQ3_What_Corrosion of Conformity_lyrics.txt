3 ContributorsWhat? LyricsDeafness, silence wait for me
Like it loud, wide open loud
Burn my hearing, jar my brain
Won't turn it down for anything
Never learn, let it burn
Never learn, let it burn
Beyond the threshold of pain
Can't even think
Say, I'm on the brink
What you say I'm unaware?
What you say I don't care
Too loud is an idea
I can't comprehend
What you say I'm unware?
Whay you say I don't careYou might also likeEmbed
