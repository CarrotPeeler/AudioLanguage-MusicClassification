4 ContributorsWish Someone Would Care Lyrics
Ooh, hoo-hoo-ooh
Ooh, hoo-hoo-ooh

Sitting home alone
Thinking about my past
Wondering how I made it
And how long it's gonna last
Success has come to lots of them
Failure is always there
Time, time waits for no one

And I wish
How I wish someone would care
Ooh-hoo, yeah
Ooh-hoo-ooh, ooh-hoo, ooh-hoo

Some folks think you're happy
When you wear your smile
What about your tribulations
And all, all of your trials
Smiles, smiles hide lots of things
The good, the bad, the hurt
All of this goes too
You might also like
And I wish
How I wish, how I wish someone would care
I wish someone would care
Don't you think someone should care?
Ah, don't you need someone to care?
Sit down and think about yourself

Yes, baby, sit down and think about yourselves
In all of my travels from town to town
City to city and country to country
I've had the opportunity to talk to a lot of ladies
And I've discovered that we women do have a lot in common
We worry about the same things: men and money
And we've also discovered that a man is a helluva thing
I think I'll say that again: a man is a helluva thing
Ah, but we women are a helluva thing, too
Anything you men can do, we manage to do it better
You know, as kids we all have our aspirations
You know, the things we wanna do when we grow up
The little boys having one-track minds, you know
But little girls are a little bit different
We wanted to grow up to be stewardesses, nurses, doctors, lawyers, and mothers
Not necessarily with children, but that little fella, different story
All he wanted was his first car and his first piece
And he knew if he could get that car, he know he gon' get that piece
Yeah, but, now that they've gotten older, nothing has changed
But we women call that two-timing
Just remember, fellas, two can play that game
And every time you men two-time, we women can three
Now, there are some of you fellas who have to have your Wheaties
You must eat your Cheerios, and you must have your One-a-Day vitamin with iron
This is so you can go out and three-time
Well, go right ahead, honey, go right ahead
Because every time you men three-time, we women can six
And our back don't hurt when we get through
Furthermore, honey, keep one thing in mind:
Yours is a non-profit item and ours is a profit-making item, haha
You know, ladies, I've also discovered that men are avid liars
Furthermore, they do it with a smile on their face
How many times you went out, came home, and your man wasn't there?
Sooner or later, here he come, rising with the sun
Smiling from ear to ear
And when you ask him, "Baby, where you been?"
He look at you grinning, saying, "Oh, I've been out with the boys"
I'd sure like to know what those boys look like to put a smile on his face like that
Have our mouth stuck out to the back door
But I found the perfect solution to that problem:
The very next time that man does that
You meet him in the door with nothing on
And have your clothes lying on the bed
And just for a wee bit of color, have a rose in your teeth
And when he comes in that door and looks at you standing there with nothing on
And those clothes on the bed and that rose in your teeth
He won't know if that man just left or you were just coming in
Guarantee he won't hang out again
But now ladies, I highly recommend that you do take a course in karate
'Cause he might come in that door and decide to knock that rose out your teeth
But now I've also discovered something else about them fellas:
They don't know what they want
You'll hear 'em all sitting down rapping together, talking about, you know, sports and stuff like that
But you'll hear 'em always getting around to the subject of women
You'll hear one man not to be outdone, you know
He'll stand up real proud and say, "Man, I love my women with big legs"
Now, honestly, I don't know why 'cause that's the first thing they throw on each side
Then you get that other fella, he's the one that likes his lady with big hips
Now, that makes sense, because if he's a little bitty man, he's gotta have something to hang on to
Now, you get that other fella, he's the one that likes that lady with long hair
Something flowing in the wind, something he can run his fingers through and hope like hell it doesn't come off
Well, I'll tell you, honey, I don't know about him, because in all these years, other than that I bought, I ain't never had long hair
But I'll tell you something else, in all these years, I ain't never had a man that asked me for hair yet
Then you get that next fella, he's the one that never got weaned
He loves 'em large, loves to be smothered
You know, you take him and kinda lay him upside his ears
And then you take one and you slap 'cross the nose with it
Mm, they call him "The Titty Man"
Well, all I got to say to him is this
Girls, those of us who are not so well endowed, don't you dare get upset
Because I was told that anything over a mouthful, it's a waste anyhow
Smiles, smiles hide lots of things
The good, the bad, the hurt
All of this goes, too
And I wish, I wish
I wish someone would care
I wish someone would care
Don't you think someone should care?
Ah, don't you need someone to care?
Sit down and think about yourself
Ah yeah
Uh-huh
Ah yeahEmbed
