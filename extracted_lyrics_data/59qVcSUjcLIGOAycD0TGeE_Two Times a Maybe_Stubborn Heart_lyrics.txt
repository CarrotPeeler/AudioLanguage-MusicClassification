1 ContributorTwo Times a Maybe LyricsNice to...
... bump into you
I needed a smile to wake the day
But no need...
...to wait through
For the shit inside my head
Put crap...
...to one side
Tell me how was your day
But first do forgive me...
I can't remember your name
ABA
Please don't start a fight
I do this all the time. /x2
Don't get...
...angry
I'm not trying to be rude
Are you...
...hungry?
I was about to grab some food
I'd love you...
...to join me
Can't forget about my little mistake?
Come on...
...I'm sorry, I've done it again
ABA
Don't go!
Please stay!
I promise I won't forget your name again. /x2You might also likeEmbed
