6 ContributorsThe Wonders at Your Feet Lyrics
Deeper shades of red descending
Smear our names, the stains unending
Turn forgiveness, break the lens distorted
Crush the infidel and turn about
Famine in our hearts, bring up the silence louder
Eradicate the lungs and take us higher now!

These are the wonders at your feet
These are the wonders at your...

Weighed upon a wider scale
Afraid to see what takes us down
Sing destruction, sing of unfullfillment
Search abandoned, let the blood be fevered
Ridden of the self provided things get easier
Ignite our minds and letâ€™s burn brighter now

These are the wonders at your feet
