Scrambled
No car will run with it
Oh blessed heaven
Hello?
Wouldn’t mind trading places with you for sure
Break your break your break your back
Huh, people live here?
Break break break break break break break your back
What do you have to do to drive this thing?
Break break break break break break break your back
Break break break break break break break your back
Break your back
Break your back
