1 ContributorThe Speed Of Life LyricsFields of empty feelings
Living life without regret
Walking through the fire
The senseless journey through these times
Living in the fast lane
A moment lost, what lies ahead
Rough and ready driver
Don't you want to stop the chase
Here's someone who stood up
Here's someone who woke up
The one who learned the meaning
Running at the speed of light
Here's somеone who held out
Someonе without doubt
Someone who feels true feelings
And running at the speed of life
Life is but a stopping point
A resting place along the road
To eternity
Different paths along the way
We all were meant to learn some things
Far greater than we know
Running away
Running away
Running away
Running away
Running away

Let's go astray
There ain't no reason to be shy
Running at the speed of life
You're running at the speed of life
All doubt and gloom
Will be no more
See all your worries
Left behind
Running at the speed of life
You're running at the speed of life
Let's seize the day
Let's go astray
There ain't no reason to be shy
Running at the speed of life
You're running at the speed of life
All doubt and gloom
Will be no more
See all your worries
Left behind
Running at the speed of life
You're running at the speed of life
Let's seize the day
Let's go astray
There ain't no reason to be shy
Running at the speed of life
You're running at the speed of life
All doubt and gloom
Will be no more
See all your worries
Left behind
Running at the speed of life
You're running at the speed of life
You're running awayEmbed
