I'm movin' on to the black train
The night, it beats me down
I'm moving on the black train
And I breathe a soundless sound

Riding on the black train
Riding on the black train

Every blood in my body moves with the train
And some of it's on the floor
I'm slippin' out to any place
Although I know I've been there before

Riding on the black train
Riding on the black train

Torn up on the black train
Torn from my southern home
Left a nigga lying dead by the river
I left the Will-O-Wisp to roam
You might also like
Riding on the black train
Riding on the black train

Ride, ride
And I can't get better, I can't get better

Riding on the black train
Riding on the black train

I'm heat on the black train
And I'm lighting up the night
With everything I've had and everything I've done
I still can't be satisfied

I'm riding on the black train
I'm riding on the black trainEmbed
