3 ContributorsThe Hunter Lyrics

A force of light, an angel
Sent through time to destroy
Avenging the dark ones
Descending angelic force

Heaven sent the hunter
Her mission to crucify
Slay the Hellspawn
His offspring, demonic force

Descending from Heaven
The angel sworn to bring them down
The hunter, the thunder
The wrath of heavens comin' down
(Oooooo-o-ooooooh, ooooooh)
Descending from Heaven
The angel sworn to bring them down
The hunter, the thunder (Aaaaaaaah)
(Oooooo-o-ooooooh, ooooooh)
The wrath of heavens comin' down

She swore an oath, an allegiance
Armageddon is in sight
To be the thorn in the Devil's back
To make him weak, the final fight

Descending from Heaven
The angel sworn to bring them down
The hunter, the thunder
The wrath of heavens comin' down
(Oooooo-o-ooooooh, ooooooh)
Descending from Heaven
The angel sworn to bring them down
The hunter, the thunder (Aaaaaaaah)
(Oooooo-o-ooooooh, ooooooh)
The wrath of heavens comin' downEmbed
