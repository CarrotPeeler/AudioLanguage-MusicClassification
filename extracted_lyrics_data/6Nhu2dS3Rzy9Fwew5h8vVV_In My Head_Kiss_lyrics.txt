4 ContributorsIn My Head Lyrics
I'm obnoxious and no one's home
In my head

Cardboard boxes filled with hate
In my head
They're in my head
Nest of termites, glowing red
In my head
They're in my head

Look behind the mask
Try to find peace of mind
And you'll find
Just look behind the man
And lead me by the hand

Faded smiles behind dark shades
In my head
Plastic icons, glowing red
In my head
They're in my head
I experiment with myself
In my head

Aaaaahhhaaaaaahaaaa


Look behind the man
Look behind the glass
Look behind the maskEmbed
