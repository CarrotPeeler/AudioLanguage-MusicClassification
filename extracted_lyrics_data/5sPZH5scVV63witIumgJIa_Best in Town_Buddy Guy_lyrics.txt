3 ContributorsBest in Town LyricsMama and daddy told me
When I was knee high to the ground
He said son don't let nobody
Push you around
You don't have to be the best in town
Just try to be the best until
Till the best come around
When I first heard Muddy Waters
I knew I was Chicago bound
Start playing on the South Side
And this is what I found
You don't have to be the best in town
Just got to be the best
Till the best come around
You don't have, to be the fastest gun
But a Hoochie Coochie man of the Seven Sons
I'm gonna keep on grinning
Till my grave's in the ground
Because I'm too far gone to ever turn around
You don't have, to be the fastest gun
But a Hoochie Coochie man of the Seven Sons
I'm gonna keep on grinning
Till my grave's in the ground
Because I'm too far gone to ever turn around

Down on Wabash Avenue
She said I'm gonna love you
You damn sure gonna love me too
You don't have to be the best in town
Just try to be the best
Looka here
You don't have to be the best in town
You just got to be the best
Till the best come aroundEmbed
