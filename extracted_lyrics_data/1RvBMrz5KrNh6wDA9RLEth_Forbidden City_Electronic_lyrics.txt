3 ContributorsForbidden City Lyrics
There's not a hope while you're in this kind of mood
Too much to drink but not enough to lose
You tore me apart now I've got to suffer
I wish I'd been around when you started this

Give me a chance I'd show you what I could do
You're in a trance and I'm not so fond of you
You may be a friend but not my relation
But you're the only person I ever knew

And it's too late to wash my hands
We're caught in a trap
Set for a man

There is a wind that blows in the northern skies
Holding me back no matter how hard I try
If I had the sense I'd leave here tomorrow
I wouldn't even bother to say goodbye

But it's too late to wash my hands
We're caught in a trap
Set for a man
You might also like

Would you lie to me if you thought I was wrong
You deserted me when it all went wrong
Would you lie to me
Would you lie to me
Would you lie to me, you thought I was wrong
You deserted me when it all went wrong

And it's too late to wash my hands
We're caught in a trap
Set for a man

But it's too late to wash my hands
We're caught in a trap
Set for a man

We're caught in a trap
Set for a man
We're caught in a trap
Set for a manEmbed
