3 ContributorsSo Blu Lyrics
You see me at the bottom, tryna to get on top
You see me at the club, tou know I used to rock
You see me cryin' tears
Lord, make 'em stop
You see the sun shine, but never on my block
You see I'm tryna to grow, let me get ahead
You know I'm tryna to do what my mamma said
Lord, I need a change
Lord, feel my pain
Lord, find me one that ain't 'bout this game

I'm tryna find a man
I'm tryna find a ring
I'm tryna find someone
Who loves me more than his bling bling
I'm tryna be a wife
I'm tryna make a life
I'm tryna get in touch with my spiritual side
Tryna have your back
I'm tryna help you stack
I'm tryna be your strength when you know you lack
Lord, I need a change
Lord, tell me you feel my pain
So blu (So blu)
So blu (So blu)
So blu (So blu)

You see me hustling for every cent I got
You see I never sleep until I reach the top
You see I can't slow down because you know it's real
You see I can't stop here, I gotta make a mill
I'm finna be a woman that stands the test of time
Ain't afraid to say I'm finna blow ya mind
I'm finna be the one you trust more than your boys
I'm finna reach the level, number one across the board

I'm tryna find a man
I'm tryna find a ring
I'm tryna find someone
Who loves me more than his bling bling
I'm tryna be a wife
I'm tryna make a life
I'm tryna get in touch with my spiritual side
Tryna have your back
I'm tryna help you stack
Tryna be your strength when you know you lack
Lord, I need a change
Lord, tell me you feel my pain
