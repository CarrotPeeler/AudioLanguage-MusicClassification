2 Contributors? Up Lyrics
Intelligence tested, stupidity manifested
Wish I could rest in this world of arrested liars
I'll set the fires free
That burned inside of me, uncontrollably
Being me, doing things that I am
I got to pay a fee for being me, Uncle Sam?
You are the hat, and I guess I'm the cat
You engulf me, so, I just got to ask

What up with your front, so what?
What up, what up, what up, what up?
You grow up pulling stunts, no luck
What up, what up, what up, what up?

I scream out to the world in distress
I confess I've been at rest at some situations
Left me contemplating and left me hating
My reaction to the action, satisfaction guaranteed
And obtained after the decision to go forth has been made
I slayed all the choices from the start
I found the only voice is in my heart

What up with your front, so what?
What up, what up, what up, what up?
You grow up pulling stunts, no luck
What up, what up, what up, what up?
You might also likeWhat up with your front, so what?
What up, what up, what up, what up?
You grow up pulling stunts, no luck
What up, what up, what up, what up?

Change phase and I make you say, "What?"
Change phase and I make you say, "Ho!"
Change phase and I make you say, "What?"
Change phase and I make you say, "Ho!"
Change phase and I make you say, "What?"
Change phase and I make you say, "Ho!"
Change phase and I make you say, "What?"
Change phase and I make you say, "Ho!"

To chart, amazing and it's possible
Two months later, the label looks at you as tossable
Its cost is full, of the price you pay to make it
They shook it and they shake it
Just to find that they have faked it
For what? To see how far that they could go?
Capitalistic fame is not gain, when you can't flow
So, go row your boat gently down the stream of Society
Why do you lie to me and why do you trick yourself?
To find the knowledge on the used shelf
Selfish and on the dish left is only parsley
There's no sign on knowledge's door saying, "Please use sparingly"
It's scaring me, but I found the answer, it's positivity
So, I ask you
What up with your front, so what?
What up, what up, what up, what up?
You grow up pulling stunts, no luck
What up, what up, what up, what up?
What up with your front, so what?
What up, what up, what up, what up?
You grow up pulling stunts, no luck
What up, what up, what up, what up?Embed
