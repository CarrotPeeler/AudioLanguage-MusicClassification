6 ContributorsLast Train LyricsLast train a-running between the waters
With the power line
Last train's a-running around the hill
Last train a-leaving on the quarter
Hour time
Last chance to get your last thrill
This world is getting so much faster
It's too sad
Poor train are rolling down slow
And I've got to keep up with the latter
It's too bad
When it's in my nature to lay low
You got me huffing and puffing and chugging like a choo choo train (choo choo)
Huffing and puffing and chugging like a choo choo train (choo choo)
Hissing and kissing and missing like a buku brain
Huffing and puffing and chugging like a choo choo train
Just like the engine at the junction
Feeling down
My head is wondering where to go
And you done got so many different trips you know
My face is wondering where to go
You got me huffing and puffin and chugging like a choo choo train (choo choo)
Huffing and puffing and chugging like a choo choo train (choo choo)
Hissing and kissing and missing like a buku brain (choo choo)
Huffing and puffing and chugging like a choo choo train (choo choo)

Feeling down
My baby wondering where to go
You got me huffing and puffin' and chugging like a choo choo train (choo choo)
Huffing and puffin' and chugging like a choo choo train (choo choo)
Hissing and kissing and missing like a buku brain (choo choo)
Huffing and puffing and chugging like a choo choo train (choo choo)
Got me huffing and puffin' and chugging like a choo choo train (choo choo)
Huffing and puffin' and chugging like a choo choo train (choo choo)
Hissing and kissing and missing like a buku brain (choo choo)
Huffing and puffing and chugging like a choo choo train (choo choo)Embed
