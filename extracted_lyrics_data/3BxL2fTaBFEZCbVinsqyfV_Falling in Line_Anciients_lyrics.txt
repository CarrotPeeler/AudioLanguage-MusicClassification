2 ContributorsFalling in Line Lyrics
Driven
Driven away
Immortal
Immortal slave
Falling away
Spiralling faster
Alone in this place
My heart is my master
Cast down
Cast down in flames
Lost
Lost on this plane
Battle of aeons
Changing of seasons
Baptized in blood
Defying reason
All we are is dust
Cast into the sea
Fall in line
Or face the wrath
You might also like
All we are is dust
Cast into the sea
Fall in line
Or face the wrath
All we are is dust
Cast into the sea
Feel your soul fall
Through the cracks

Cursed journey
Broken honour
Monolithic
Quest for answers
Hail to fire
Crooked smile
Crystal vision
Seeking knowledge

Tear your soul apart
Show the world
Your heart
Chant immortal rites
Give the Earth your lifeEmbed
