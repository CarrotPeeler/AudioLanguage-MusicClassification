1 ContributorOlympics LyricsSydney 2000's coming up
And it fills us with inspiration
From Hobart to Cairns
Albury to Wodonga
To the heart of this great brown nation
It'll be bigger than footy
Bigger than netball
Bigger than darts or cricket
I won't be eating for the next six months
'Cause I've already paid for my ticket
Australians all let us rejoice
For we are young and free
Except for the Australians who aren't so young
And the ones in jail indefinitely
Australia's population is from all over the world, you know
We especially welcome migrants who are really good at the discus or the hammer throw
We support our athletes all the way
'Cause they're the ones we choose
We don't want to know what they inject or abuse
As long as Australia doesn't lose
Australian' all let us rejoice
With beauties rich and rare
Rich like an Australian golfer who wins
And rare like an Australian golfer who wins
You might also likeSOCOG has been criticized
But they're the best that money can buy
My hotel has been booked for me
I'm staying in Gundagai
Australians all let us rejoice
The spirit of the Olympic Flame
We train and we train and we train and we train
But we still can't win like we do at the Commonwealth Games
If you calculate how many medals we win
Per capita of population
Take into account our alphabetical advantage
Then Australia is the Number 1 Olympic NationEmbed
