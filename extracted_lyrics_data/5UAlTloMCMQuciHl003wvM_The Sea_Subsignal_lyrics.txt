1 ContributorThe Sea LyricsSomething broke the even surface
Camouflaged and partly blind
Parading fireflies
In the orange light
Something nameless woke
When we
Closed our eyes to the burning salt
On an island surrounded by the sea and the darkened earth
Each other's perfect luck
And each other's pain
Each other's promise
And each other's guilt
Each other's blessing
And each other's curse
Each other's everything
Each other's loss
Each other's blue sky
Each other's rain
Each other's sunlight
And each other's night
Each other's paradise
And each other's hell
Some things remain
While others get lost
You might also likeI saw the writhing shapes of men
Bathed in moonlight
Beautiful and monstrous
We're a song felt in the deepest bones
Felt the soothing wind like a lover's warmth
We're like butterflies
With flailing wings
Inside the palm
Just a picture dear
Swallowed by the sea, by the sea...Embed
