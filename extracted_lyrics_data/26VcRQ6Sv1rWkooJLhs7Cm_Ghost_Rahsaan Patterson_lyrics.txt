1 ContributorGhost Lyrics
My doctor said you was no good
She said you never would be good
If i had listened to her words
I wouldn't be singing this verse
You're looking at me like you know
That i see all of your gunshow
Stop breaking gains and makin' smoke
Or turn around and I'll be ghost

I'll be ghost
I'll be long gone, long gone
Ghost (like a phenomenon)
Ghost (like a phenomenon)
I'll be ghost
I'll be long gone, long gone
Ghost (like a phenomenon)
Ghost (like a phenomenon)

My doctor said you was no good
She said you never would be good
If i had listened to her words
I wouldn't be singing this verse
You might also like
You're looking at me like you know
That I see all of your gunshow
Stop breaking gains and makin' smoke
Or turn around and I'll be ghost
I'll be ghost

And I'm done
I'm going home now
Where... are... my... keys?
