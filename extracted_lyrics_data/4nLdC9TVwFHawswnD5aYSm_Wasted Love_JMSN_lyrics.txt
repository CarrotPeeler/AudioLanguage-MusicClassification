7 ContributorsWasted Love LyricsLike grains of sand inside my hand
It's falling away from me now
Falling away from me now
A wise man would understand
But I just disagree now
I just disagree now
See, the whole entire world isn't quite enough
No it's not enough
I want to feel something that's not just wasted love
Just wasted love
Like grains of sand inside my hand
It's falling away from me now
See, the whole entire world isn't quite enough
No it's not enough
I want to feel something that's not just wasted love
Just wasted love
The world isn't quite enough
All of this wasted love
And when I find you everything fades away
Everything fades awaySee JMSN LiveGet tickets as low as $87You might also like2Embed
