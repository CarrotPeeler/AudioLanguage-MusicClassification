5 ContributorsMad Tom of Bedlam LyricsFor to see Mad Tom of Bedlam
Ten thousand miles I've travelled
Mad Maudlin goes on dirty toes
To save her shoes from gravel
Still I sing bonney boys, bonney mad boys
Bedlam boys are bonney
For they all go bare, and they live in the air
And they want no drink nor money
I went down to Satan's Kitchen
For to break my fast one morning
And there I got souls piping hot
All on the spits a-turning
Still I sing bonney boys, bonney mad boys
Bedlam boys are bonney
For they all go bare, and they live in the air
And they want no drink nor money
The spirit hot as lightening
Did on that journey guide me
The sun did shake and the pale moon quake
Wherever they did spy me
Still I sing bonney boys, bonney mad boys
Bedlam boys are bonney
For they all go bare, and they live in the air
And they want no drink nor money
You might also likeMy staff has murdered giants
And my pack a long knife carries
For to slice mince pies from children's thighs
From which to feed the faeries
Still I sing bonney boys, bonney mad boys
Bedlam boys are bonney
For they all go bare, and they live in the air
And they want no drink nor money
Tonight I'll go a murdering
The man in the moon to a powder
His dog I'll shake and his staff I'll break
And there'll howl no demon louder
Still I sing bonney boys, bonney mad boys
Bedlam boys are bonney
For they all go bare, and they live in the air
And they want no drink nor money
To see Mad Tom of Bedlam
Ten thousand miles I've travelled
Mad Maudlin goes on dirty toes
To save her shoes from gravel
Still I sing bonney boys, bonney mad boys
Bedlam boys are bonney
For they all go bare, and they live in the air
And they want no drink nor moneyEmbed
