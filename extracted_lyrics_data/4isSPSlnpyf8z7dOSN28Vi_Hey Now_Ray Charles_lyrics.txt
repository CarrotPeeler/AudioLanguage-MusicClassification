Well, did you ever wake up in the morning?
Just about the break of day
Reach over and rub the pillow
Where your baby used to lay

Hey now!
Hey now, hey now, hey now, hey now
Well, you know they make you feel so bad
That you lay right down and die

Then you put on your crying
Like you've never cried before
You even cry so loud
You give the blues to your neighbour next door

Hey now!
Hey now, hey now, hey now, hey now
Well, you know they make you feel so bad
That you lay right down and die

Well, I got the blues so bad now
And I'm just hurt my feet to walk now
Well people, I got the blues so bad now
People I just hurt my tonky-tonk now
You might also like
Hey now!
Hey now, hey now, hey now, hey now
Well, you know they make you feel so bad
That you lay right down and die
Then you cry Lord, Lord
Won't you hear my plea?
I know you can help (much) more than anybody
So won't you please send a little bit down to me?

Hey now!
Hey now, hey now, hey now, hey now
Well, you know they make you feel so bad
That you lay right down and dieEmbed
