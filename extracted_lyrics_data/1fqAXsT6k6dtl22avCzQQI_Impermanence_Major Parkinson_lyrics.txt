2 ContributorsImpermanence LyricsI see you only try to kill the pain
Lying on the carpet like a child, impermanence in your vein
You know it's never going to be the same
Summers running through the everglades, rounding up the daisy chains
All that you gave was all that you got
Raindrops dripping from a parasol, making puddles to collect the blue skies
Made you tremble, made you small in the impermanence of the fall
You build a house, you change your name
I know you only try to love somebody through your cold restraints
The stations ever passing by your train
In this moment that we can't explain, in difference we are the same
All that we give is all that we got
Sidewalks are moving slowly like an escalator in the brickwork of a tailor
The skyline is a hummingbird trading poems for a crossword
It takes you even deeper, you fall into a stupor of imagination
Tell me where you want to go, tell me where you want to go
All that we give is all that we got
All your life you've been looking for someone to love
Someone to caress you, now you are lost
You felt something wasn't right, you had your reasons
All of the quotes from Keats, TS Eliot, Byron and Pope
They tore something that was yours
Infantile playing in between the changing seasonsYou might also like1Embed
