1 ContributorAll For You LyricsI got a mean streak, yeah
Facing down your street
Baby you better cross over
'Cause my game face is all you're going to meet
It's all for you, honey
We won't put the kicking boots on
I got no reason to lie to you, honey
You got me, but you still got me wrong
You know that I got a mean streak, yeah
Falling at your feet
You're gonna have to stomp it out right now, honey
I'm a Jeckyll and Hyde, a mother fuckin' freak
It is all for you
You see I'm just tryin' to find my party route
It is all for you
You see I'm just trying to flex my body out
It is all for you
You see I'm just trying to get my grind on
It is all for you
Before I gotta pick it up and drag it home
It's all for you, honey
We won't put the kicking boots on
I got no reason to lie to you, honey
You got me, but you still got me wrong
Because it's all for you, honey
We won't put the kicking boots on
I got no reason to lie to you, honey
You got me, but you still got me wrong this timeYou might also likeEmbed
