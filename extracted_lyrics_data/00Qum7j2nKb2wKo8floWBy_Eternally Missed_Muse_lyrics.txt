13 ContributorsEternally Missed Lyrics
Chase your dreams away
Glass needles in the hay
The sun forgives the clouds
You are my holy shroud

I just don't care if it's real
That won't change how it feels
I just don't care if it's real
That won't change how it feels
No, it doesn't change

And you can't resist
Making me feel eternally missed
You can't resist
You can't resist
Making me feel

Chase your dreams away
Glass needles in the hay
The sun forgives the clouds
You are my holy shroud
You might also like
I just don't care if it's real
That won't change how it feels
I just don't care if it's real
That won't change how it feels
No, it doesn't change

And you can't resist
Making me feel eternally missed
You can't resist
You can't resist
Making me feel


You can't resist
Making me feel eternally missed
You can't resist
You can't resist
Making me feel
And you can't resist
Making me feel eternally missed
You can't resist
You can't resist
Making me feel
(Chase your dreams away)
(Glass needles in the hay)
(The sun forgives the clouds)
(You are my holy shroud)3Embed
