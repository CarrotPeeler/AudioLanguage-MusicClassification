3 ContributorsThe Last Conquistador LyricsI am the last conquistador
I am well meaning and intentions are earnest
I am the first to document
My route is new an my spirit enlightened
I kept hold for your letters
But maybe it would be better if they burn
Blueberries and dreams
Burst at the seams
My route was clear but a cloud fell upon me
Blueberries and dreams
Hollowed and squeezed
My route was clear but a cloud fell upon me
Stepped into darkness only stars left to guide me
Still I´m the last conquistador
I keep on going
Though the going ain´t easy
And now my mind´s in farrago
All jumbled up, in the promise of empire
I´m still searching for Beulah
And one day I will hold her in my arms
Blueberries and dreams
Burst at the seams
My route was clear but a cloud fell upon me
Blueberries and dreams
Hollowed and squeezed
I´m so delirious I´m oblivious to previous
Hallucinations of a fool, that deceived us
A combination of disease and confusion
My whole life´s work, was just an illusion
Blueberries and dreams
Burst at the seams
My route was clear but a cloud fell upon me
Blueberries and dreams
Hollowed and squeezed
A combination of disease and confusion
My whole life´s work, was just an illusion
