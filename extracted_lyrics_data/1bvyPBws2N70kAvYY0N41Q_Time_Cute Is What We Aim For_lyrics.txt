3 ContributorsTime LyricsThe roads are wrapped around your waist
They lead me place to place
I take trips from hip to hip
In fact I've made a career out of it
I've always thought the left was your strongest side
But when it comes to you now I can't decide
It's only a matter of time

I need the product of your fears in the form of tears
It's the only way I can survive
It breaks my heart to see you crying, baby
It's the only way I'll stay alive
Green eyes, blue skies
Natural disasters when she cries
Green eyes, they're mine
It's only a matter of time
Like the climate, you never know what weather you get
No denying you're the habit that I can't quit
It's only a matter of mine

I need the product of your fears in the form of tears
It's the only way I can survive
It breaks my heart to see you crying, baby
It's the only way I'll stay alive
Green eyes, blue skies
Natural disasters when she cries
Green eyes, they're mine
It's only a matter of time
You might also likeRotating, I'm shaking
I hope you turn around in time
Tide is changing, I'm waiting
But you and I are one of a kind
I've been to both hemispheres over my short years
I still can't pick my favorite place
The contour of your lips
They match the continents
And I still love the way that you taste

I need the product of your fears in the form of tears
It's the only way I can survive
It breaks my heart to see you crying, baby
It's the only way I'll stay alive
Green eyes, blue skies
Natural disasters when she cries
Green eyes, they're mine
It's only a matter of timeEmbed
