4 ContributorsYou Are My Sunshine Lyrics
Oooh, they tell me that into each life
Some rain has sure got to fall
Oooh, they tell me here, that everybody
Has sure, has sure got to cry sometime (Cry)
And, oh, if some rain (Some rain)
If some rain has got to fall (Some rain)
On everybody, and I've had enough rain in my life
Then I'm so glad right now
I got a little love around me
To keep the rain off my head, yeah, yeah
And I believe it's, I believe it's
I believe it's because (Tell me what do you believe)
I believe because

On the other night, as I lay sleeping
I dreamed I held you, I held you in my arms, yeah
But when I woke up and found out I was mistaken, yeah
You know that I hung my (You know that I hung my)
Hung my head and I cried (Head and I cried)

Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby (Baby)
You are my sunshine (Baby)
You sure make me happy, baby, oh, when the skies are grey
And you’ll never, never, never know, ah, how much I need you
I don’t want you to take my (Oh baby, don't you take my)
Take my sunshine away (Shining away)
You might also like
You told me once, you did it, that you really loved me
And no one else could ever, could ever come between, yeah
But now you’re thinking about to leaving me (Leaving)
For another, yeah (Leaving)
If you do you know you’re going to shatter
Shatter every one of my dreams (All of my dreams)

Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby (Baby)
You are my sunshine (Baby)
You sure make me happy, baby, oh, when the skies are grey
And you’ll never, never, never know, ah, how much I need you
I don’t want you to take my (Oh baby, don't you take my)
Take my sunshine away (Shining away)
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby (Baby)
You are my sunshine (Baby)
You sure make me happy, baby, oh, when the skies are grey
And you’ll never, never, never know, ah, how much I need you
I don’t want you to take my (Oh baby, don't you take my)
Take my sunshine away (Shining away)1Embed
