3 ContributorsShotgun Lyrics
Oh oh oh baby
You know I love you, baby
I'm in love with you, yes I am

I saw you in her arms, darlin’
I saw you kiss her lips, baby
And come back home and tell me your sweet lies

So I'm gonna go get my shotgun, darlin’
'Cause you know I love you, baby
And if I can't have you nobody can

Late last night, they laid you in your lonesome grave
And don’t you know tonight they lay me beside youYou might also likeEmbed
