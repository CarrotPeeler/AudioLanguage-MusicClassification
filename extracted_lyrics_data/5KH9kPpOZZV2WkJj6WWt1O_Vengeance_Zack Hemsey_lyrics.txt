Let me have vengeance
Before I die alone
I will have vengeance
Before I die alone
Let me have vengeance
Before I die alone
I will have vengeance
Before I die alone
Before my time has gone
There's just one thing I have to do
Before the fire and stone
Before your world is gone
Have you some patience
Cause I will have my vengeance
Before I die alone
Let me have vengeance
Before I die alone
I will have vengeance
Before I die alone
Let me have vengeance
Before I die alone
I will have vengeance
