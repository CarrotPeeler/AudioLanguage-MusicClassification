2 ContributorsThe Burial of Gods LyricsCome with me, I'll bring you life
I'll bring you life through lifeless damned eyes
By these hands you'll be mine
By these hands you'll witness nothing
You'll witness life, you'll witness death
You'll be the ground I'm walking on
Forever filth, I'm unblessed
You'll be the soil where my ashes burn
A black moon freezes the Earth and sky
Dark be the funeral of life
Total damnation and gods seeking trust
And what once was will soon be lost
Long they've been wandering Mother Earth
Soon they will fall from the curse
Come with me, I'll bring you life
I'll bring you life through lifeless damned eyes
Time has reached eternal night
No more stars with light the sky
End time is here, no more life
This is the burial of all time
Eternal damnation, everlasting pain
These things I bring you, I'm giving away
Hear the warning, fear the calling
Feel the dawn ring, the end come crawling
You might also likeMajestic thunder roar up high
Blessed be this funeral pyre
Now drink the final cup of blood
It is the burial of gods
Blessed be
Help my beloved
For the godly men cease to exist
And they fail to be faithful

Majestic thunder roar up high
Blessed be this funeral pyre
Now drink the final cup of blood
It is the burial of gods
By these hands you'll be mine
By these hands you'll witness nothing
You give me strength to carry on
Give me strength to kill myself
I feel your words but refuse to hear
Feel your words but they mean nothing
I am the answer, I am the way
I am The Lustrate ProcessEmbed
