2 ContributorsUncle June and Aunt Kiyoti LyricsLying all night, screaming in pain
Defending the cross in the Belfast rain
The billy saw me at the end of the street
So I lit up my torch and embraced him with heat
Town of Aintab in 340 A.D
Threw me in a quarry, no way to get free
I called on hate to give me my life
And he came on his black horse, obsidian knife
Happened one night, I was lying in bed
Eyes wide open, I could have been dead
The sky lady came with her eyes shining bright
And the bears and the billies and the bullies took flight
But I called them all back
And the sky lady too
The bears and the billies and the bullies
Me and you
We laid down our bombs and bows
And drank to their health on the Anatolian plateau
From New Scotland to Calgary
The geese are high and so are we
We don't even need a map
We're way too fast for the highway trap
You might also likeSo hit the road and shine a light
I think we're gonna find the path tonight
Shooting star and the moon is bad
It's the best damn omen that we ever hadEmbed
