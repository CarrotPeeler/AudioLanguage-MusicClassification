1 ContributorOblivion Lyrics
Yeah
Oakland, California
Nineteen-two-thousand and seventy-seven
Yeah, Azeem, 33-M, Germany, what′s happening?
Told y'all a long time man, E.T.C. - Erase and Take Charge
Time never was, yeah...

Told you last record our minds was museums
When you bare witness, no need to believe it
I wrote these vocals while dreaming
Riding on lions with wings, watching Hell being freezing (Uh)
You can go call all your popular demons
And wizards and witches and lizards and preachers
They build more prisons than places for teachers
Prostitute freedom, gavе us fake leaders
Brokе out the paint, and made a fake Jesus
Broke off the noses to make a fake Egypt
Greek like Adonis, Nike and Adidas
Talisons made from Osiris′s penis
Legacy stolen, statues of Venus
Asses the sizes of Rome Colosseum (woo)
Juggernauts, Cyclops, and Titans eat Häagen-Dazs
Waiting in Babylon, return of the astronauts

Tricked y'all, didn′t I? (Nope)
Not never would I take a likkle break, and not sound better (ah)
I wrote this words with the feather
Ran outta ink, and used tears from the Devil
He taught me how to succeed
He said, "Rest is a weapon, your enemy is sleep."
No matter what they think
A soldier with no enemy will never know his own strength
So the music is richer (Yeah)
And all the beats sound thicker (Uh-huh)
And all my lyrics are pictures
I wrote this image, so you see what a prince is
Another way to depict it
That tunnel with that light you could see from a distance
With flames and black fists lifting the sentence
And crush the metropolis (yep), just as predicted
That′s a beautiful vision
I just painted armageddon and made it sound like heaven
That's just how we living
I told you that the roof′s on fire, I really meant it

Get the people's hands up above
Get-Get, Get, Get respect and love worldwide

Get-Get, Get, Get respect and love worldwide

World-, world-, world-

Follow me
If angels had fingers connected to strings
We would be puppets and love would be king
War wouldn't be a word of any worth
They made Earth on Hell out of Heaven on Earth

Fly scriptures above skyscrapers with chemical planes
Spray poison over East Berlin
And over Oakland where the gangsters live
No lotion like Capleton- rough, it′s war outside (uh-huh)
I cry for Natalie, I heard she died
I hope I see you on the other side of town
Infinite, God mind, I'm living in it
Out-of-body, and I′m leaving all this alien genetics with it
Hop a ship with some Pleiadians and travel with them
And head the Venus for Serena-shaped women (yeah)
Ancient mind, metric vision
I turn ink to wine, and get the sky drunk with it

Get the people's hands up above
Get-Get, Get, Get respect and love worldwide
Worldwide
Get the people's hands up above
Get-Get, Get, Get respect and love worldwide
Worldwide
Get the people's hands up above
Get-Get, Get, Get respect and love worldwide
Worldwide
Get the people's hands up above
Get-Get, Get, Get respect and love worldwide
World-, world-, world-

Do you know what time it is?
DJ Zeph, Azeem
