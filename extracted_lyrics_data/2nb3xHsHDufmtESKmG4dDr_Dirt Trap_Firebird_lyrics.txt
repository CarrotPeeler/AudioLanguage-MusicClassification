1 ContributorDirt Trap LyricsSay that I'm wrong
Well I'm feeling alright
Pretty hard to take
You know I won't care
If you're taking your share
Even when there's pride at stake
In a dirt trap
Wide awake
In a dirt trap, yeah now
Where you'll stay
Well it's always the same
I'm feeling your shame
???
Well there's nothing to tell
Except that I wish you well
???
Alright, now
In a dirt trap
Wide awake
In a dirt trap
Where you'll stay

Wide awake
In a dirt trap, yeah now
Where you'll stayEmbed
