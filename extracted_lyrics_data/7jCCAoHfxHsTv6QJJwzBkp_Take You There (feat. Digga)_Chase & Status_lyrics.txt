Hi everyone, hope your Bank Holiday's going great! Let's take a look at what's been going on in UK music this past two weeks!NewsBBC Radio 1's Big Weekend took place over the last couple of days, and there were huge performances from artists like Stormzy with his new(ish) single "Vossi Bop" and Mark Ronson bringing Miley Cyrus on stage! Lewis Capaldi was also there, and he said:I think it might be the best gig I've ever played in my life.Lewis even got love from Stiff Chocolate himself; Stormzy said that Lewis was his new favourite artist, which Lewis said was nice.
Unfortunately, Jess Glynne couldn't perform, since she was ill, but the band didn't know this. They turned up expecting to find Jess and a huge crowd of fans waiting to hear them, but instead found a booing crowd. Since they couldn't leave, they headed into town to watch Aladdin instead.
Meanwhile, the Spice Girls played in Dublin, but the fans and critics weren't too happy with the sound. Mel B even agreed, and she said:We will see you in Cardiff. And hopefully, the vocals and the sound will be much, much better.ProjectsGenius UK DiscordNot gonna stop plugging our Discord - join in and have a chat!List of UK Verified ArtistsThis list is looking great!
