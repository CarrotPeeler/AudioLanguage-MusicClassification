5 ContributorsUnder the Christmas Tree LyricsThe warmest season of the year is here again
December is beginning to shine
Tingles come into the atmosphere again
So fine, so fine
With everybody running getting something done
So little time and so much to do
I thought I'd write a note or two of Christmas cheer
To you, to you
Don't Forget The love
Under the Christmas tree
Tonight
Put love
Under the tree
Everybody around the world
Wherever you may be
Don't Forget, The love
Under the Christmas tree
The songs I love are playing on the radio
The people that I love on the way
I'm wishing once again the world would always be
A holiday, a holiday
Don't Forget The love
Under the Christmas tree
Tonight
Put love
Under the tree
Everybody around the world
Wherever you may be
Don't Forget, The love
Under the Christmas tree
(Merry Christmas, merry Christmas)
Everybody around the world
Wherever you may be
Don't Forget, The love
Under the Christmas tree
(Merry Christmas, merry Christmas)
Don't Forget The love
Under the Christmas tree
Tonight
Put love
Under the tree
Everybody around the world
Wherever you may be
Don't Forget, The love
