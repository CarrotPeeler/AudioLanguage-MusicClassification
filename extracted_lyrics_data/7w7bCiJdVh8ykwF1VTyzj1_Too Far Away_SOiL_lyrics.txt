1 ContributorToo Far Away LyricsI took your hand
You slipped away from me
I understand
Why you had to leave
No matter how I try
Holding on for life
You cannot hear my cries no more, no more
Heaven took you far away from me
Left me empty and alone
Heaven took you far away from me
Too far away for me to go
It's getting late
I'm right here next to you
I'm glad I stayed
To see the last of you
No matter how I try
Holding on for life
You cannot hear my cries no more, no more
Heaven took you far away from me
Left me empty and alone
Heaven took you far away from me
Too far away for me to go
You might also likeThe last breath is fading from your lips now
The warmth is leaving from your hands
You're slipping further away
Slipping away
Slipping far away
Heaven took you far away from me
Left me empty and alone
Heaven took you far away from me
Too far away for me to go
(Too far away for me to go)
Heaven took you far away from me
Left me empty and alone
Heaven took you far away from me
Too far away for me to go
I took your hand
You slipped awayEmbed
