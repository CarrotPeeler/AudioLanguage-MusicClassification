3 ContributorsThis Is The Other Side Of Life LyricsDon't let your head hang down
Try to raise it up to the sky
This is life my friend
I know it ain't far from dying
Don't hide in mist all day and night
To fade your scars and pain away
The world is glass my friend
Look at the other side of life today
Don't let your head hang down
Try to raise it up to the sky
This is life my friend
I know it ain't far from dying
Don't hide in mist all day and night
To fade your scars and pain away
The world is glass my friend
Look at the other side of life todayYou might also likeEmbed
