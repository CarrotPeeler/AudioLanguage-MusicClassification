1 ContributorDirty Magazine LyricsA cut-out picture of a sugar tart
With olive skin, a purple heart
Concrete shoes, and it's just the start
Of bigger things unseen
Heroes of our glory days
Ride upon the hip-hoorays
Of hometown girls who've been displayed
In dirty magazines
"And what am I supposed to do with you?"
Just tell me everything I've heard before
Like it was news
The miners strike, hold out for love
We bust their heads, push and shove
By helmet light, we rise above
And say, "look out below!"
They're such a grim, romantic crew
Swear they won't forget but do
It leaves them free to cry anew
At every song we know
"And what am I supposed to do with you?"
Just tell me everything I want to hear
Like it was true
You might also likeSometimes I wish that I was king
And held the end of every string
The fear, the prize, the mortal sting
Of what will come of this
For now I'll let all chance unwind
To keep our secret hearts entwined
And if I choose to see this as a ign
It surely is
"And what am I supposed to do with you?"
Just tell me everything I've heard before
Like it was newsEmbed
