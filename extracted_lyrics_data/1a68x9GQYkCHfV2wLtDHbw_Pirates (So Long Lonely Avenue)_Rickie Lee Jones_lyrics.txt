5 ContributorsPirates (So Long Lonely Avenue) Lyrics
Come on, Joey, get out of school
We got places to go
A '57 Lincoln it's got a radio that hurts
And the girls like to touch it
Just to find out if it works
But don't look at me
It wasn't me

Joey live on the edge of the corner
Of living on the run
I like to ride in the middle
I'm just tryin' to have some fun
Until the pirates come

And I won't need a pilot
'Cause I've got a pirate who might sail
Somewhere I heard far away
You answer me
So I'm holding on
To your rainbow sleeves

Well, goodbye boys
Oh, my buddy boys
Oh, my sad-eyed Sinatras
It's a cold globe around the sea
You keep the shirt that I bought ya
But I know you'll get the chance to make it
Nothing's gonna stop you
You just reach right out and take it
You say
So long, lonely avenue
Hey, so long, lonely avenue
See Rickie Lee Jones LiveGet tickets as low as $80You might also like
But I'll see you there
Wait and see
Be lookin' for me
Just like you
Just like me
YeahEmbed
