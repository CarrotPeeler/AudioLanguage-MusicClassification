1 ContributorCommercial Breakdown LyricsYeah
Oh Maybe I'm right
Oh maybe I'm wrong
We can fight for one single way to get along
And we've all got to not shake down!
And I've only missin' a point
And I can't search the way to try to telling lies
So I'll tell my problem
You're never gonna get me
If I'm too be busy
A social conscience
I saw it on the tv
At least it keeps me busy
Oh maybe sometimes
I find it hard to comply
With people that don't look you in the eye
And it's because all the commercial breakdown!
And I've only missin' a point
Is what the media's sayin'
That is switching to ....
So I'll tell my problem
You're never gonna get me
We're far too busy
And so's your conscience
What story gonna save me
At least it keeps me busy
