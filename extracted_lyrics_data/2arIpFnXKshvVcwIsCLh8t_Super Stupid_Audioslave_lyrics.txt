Thought it was coke but it was skag
Super stupid did a one on one
Then his eyes were full of water and his nose began to run
Oh, stupid with your ups and downs
And your maggot brain, and your grins and frowns
Super stupid you are here today
But you lost the fight and the winner is fearYou might also like1Embed
