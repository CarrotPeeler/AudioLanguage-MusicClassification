5 ContributorsHe’s Frank LyricsHe's got secular joy
He's a peculiar boy
But now the lustre has gone
The peculiar boy is no more
Who'll save him from being a man
Not me
He's got precious youth
But forsaken, forsooth
And now the shine grows dim
Change tradition for whim
Who'll save him from being a man
Not me
He's got clothes all red
All on a purple bed
But now the red's in his eyes
He's no longer a prize
Who'll save him from being a man
Not me
He's a peculiar boy
Yes, he's a peculiar boy
But now his skin is slack
He shows a certain lack
You might also likeWho'll save him from being a man
