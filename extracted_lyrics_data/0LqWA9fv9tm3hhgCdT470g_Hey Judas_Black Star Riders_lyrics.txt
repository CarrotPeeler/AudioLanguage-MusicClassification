After everything you’ve done
I still trust you Judas
Like i never trusted in no one
You took me to the movies
We’ve been there ever since
I would give you everything
If I’d anything to give
Hey, hey Judas
Hey, hey Judas
What you gonna do now
Hey, hey Judas
Hey, hey Judas
You lie and you cheat but I love you anyhow
You’re the fastest gun in town
I’m the king of following you around
You’re making every card you deal
Breaking hearts at the speed of sound
They say that a fool is a wonderful thing
Guess I’m a fool for all the hurt that you bring
My mind mocks itself as I strive to play
The game I know I’m gonna lose anyway

Hey, hey Judas
What you gonna do now
Hey, hey Judas
Hey, hey Judas
You’re so cold, callous and corrupted
I’m broken, battered and bloody
Disheveled, distracted and painful
The switchblade eyes of a fallen angel
You took me to the movies
We’ve been there ever since
I would give you everything
If I’d anything to give
Hey, hey Judas
Hey, hey Judas
What you gonna do now
Hey, hey Judas
Hey, hey JudasEmbed
