If you don't want me, please don't dog me around
If you don't want me, don't dog me around
My home ain't here, it's in most any old town
My home ain't here, it's in most any old town
My home ain't here, it's most any old town
I'm goin' up on a mountain and look down on the sea
Saw a bullyin'1 alligator, she was doin' that shivaree2
Saw a bullyin' alligator doin' the shivaree
Tell me, friend, ever since that bullyin' Stack3 been made
Kansas City, Missouri, has been her regular trade
Kansas City, Missouri, been her regular trade
The Kate's4 in the bend, the Stack is turnin' around and 'round
The stern wheel knockin', friend, I'm Alabama bound5
The stern wheel knockin', I'm Alabama bound
My mama told me, an' old papa told me, too
Said, "Brownskin women, son, gonna be the death of you"
Said, "Brownskin women, gonna be the death of you"
I told mama last night, friends, and papa the night before
"If brownskin women kill me, mama, let me go"
"If brownskin women kill me, mama, let me go"You might also likeEmbed
