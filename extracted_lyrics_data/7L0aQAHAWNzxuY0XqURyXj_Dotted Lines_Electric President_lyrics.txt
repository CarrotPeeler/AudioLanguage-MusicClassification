1 ContributorDotted Lines Lyrics
My heart won't break, it's locked and safe
There is no key, okay, okay
The windowpanes can't stop the rain
The wind outside, it sounds like trains
We're so well read, we've filled our heads
With all the knowledge left for dead
But we're still cracked, we can't relax
'Cause all we learned is nothing lasts
(Fuckin' , I'll kill you)

It's nil out there with all their stares
But we don't care, don't care, don't care
We toed the line, but it broke this time
And now we've sunk to picking fights
It's sad but true that it's up to you
To find the faults in what we do
I know my place, it's the same old case
It's what we've labeled saving face

There's always time to sign your name
There's always a dotted line to blame
There's always laugh tracks in my brain
Whenever I try to explain things
Seems everyone's an open book
And they found mine and you all looked
The pages were blank
Except the last one shows my middle finger
You might also like
But I can't complain, I got this way
By laughing at the sadder things
It's like we're cursed, we're always first
To watch as our hopes hit the dirt
But we don't mind, we always find
Another guinea pig to fry
I like to think that I can't sink
'Cause I hit bottom just last weekEmbed
