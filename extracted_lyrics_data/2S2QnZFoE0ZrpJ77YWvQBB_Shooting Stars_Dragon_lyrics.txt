1 ContributorShooting Stars LyricsIt's that time of the year
Leaves are falling to the ground
I'm waking up to find the curtain falling down
In the streets nobody laughs at all
The people that I meet make the strangest sounds
We're all shooting stars in the sky
And it seems that love always blinds my eyes
Shooting stars, they never last
I'm on a fast train, I'm on a fast train
Looks like I'm never gonna change
The longest day and the shortest night
Shooting stars spread their light over me
Loving arms, oh those fading charms
I'm waking up to a world of mystery
Shooting stars in the sky
And it seems that love always blinds my eyes
Shooting stars, thеy never last
I'm on a fast train, I'm on a fast train
Looks like I'm nеver gonna change
It's a mystery to me, am I just a shooting star?
It's a mystery of shooting star that shines a light on me
Am I just a shooting star in the sky?
