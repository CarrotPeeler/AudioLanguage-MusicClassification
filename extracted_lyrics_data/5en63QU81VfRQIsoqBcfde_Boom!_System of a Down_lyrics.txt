43 ContributorsBoom! Lyrics
(Oh, oh-oh-oh)
I've been walking through your streets
Where all your money's earning
Where all your buildings crying and clueless neckties working
(Oh, oh-oh-oh)
Revolving fake lawn houses, housing all your fears
Desensitized by TV
(Oh, oh-oh-oh)
Overbearing advertising, god of consumerism
And all your crooked pictures looking good
(Oh, oh-oh)
Mirrorism, filtering information for the public eye
Designed for profiteering your neighbor, what a guy

Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!
Every time you drop the bomb
You kill the God your child has born
Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!

(Oh, oh-oh-oh)
Modern globalization, coupled with condemnations
Unnecessary death
(Oh, oh-oh-oh)
Matador corporations
Puppeting your frustrations with the blinded flag
Manufacturing consent is the name of the game
(Oh, oh-oh-oh)
The bottom line is money, nobody gives a fuck
4000 hungry children leave us per hour from starvation
(Oh, oh-oh)
While billions are spent on bombs, creating death showers

Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!
Every time you drop the bomb
You kill the God your child has born
Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!
Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!

Why must we kill our own kind?

Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!
Every time you drop the bomb
You kill the God your child has born
Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!
Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!
Every time you drop the bomb (Boom!)3Embed
