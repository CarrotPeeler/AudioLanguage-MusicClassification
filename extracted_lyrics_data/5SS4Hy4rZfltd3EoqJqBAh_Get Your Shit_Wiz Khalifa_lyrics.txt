27 ContributorsGet Your Shit Lyrics
I'm tired of arguin' and fightin', girl
Every night you keep callin' me with the same shit, I'm goin' insane
I swear I love you but this ain't right for us
I never thought it would end this way, it's gon' kill me to say
But you gotta
Pack your stuff, leave my keys
Get your shit, gotta go
Pack your stuff, leave my keys
Get your shit, gotta go
Pack your stuff, leave my keys
Get your shit, gotta go
Told you that I'm movin' on
You didn't, well you outta know

To how to shape and mould you, I admit was my mission
But everything went wrong there 'cause you started acting different
The day you ran up on me I was smoking, chilling
Swore you was trying to roll, ain't know it was so appealing
Fast forward, I'm on the road, you at home, calling me back, forth
Can't deal with this relationship but this what you asked for
Ask for them picture of them bitches
Shit, I probably wouldn't be with 'em if your ass wasn't tripping
Not to mention you actin' like a kid, is the fuck shit I gotta deal with
Send a text, leave me a message, try not to listen
Bring a ref, you was the main player, I had to bench you
When I showed your ass how to ball, that Louis I bought it all
You might also like
I'm tired of arguin' and fightin', girl
Every night you keep callin' me with the same shit, I'm goin' insane
I swear I love you but this ain't right for us
I never thought it would end this way, it's gon' kill me to say
But you gotta
Pack your stuff, leave my keys
Get your shit, gotta go
Pack your stuff, leave my keys
Get your shit, gotta go
Pack your stuff, leave my keys
Get your shit, gotta go
Told you that I'm movin' on
You didn't, well you outta know

Gone on the road and I'm hardly home on the weekend
You be blowing my phone up, trying to see who I'm seeing
But I'm chasing this paper, so for this paper I'm reaching
Might fuck one or two bitches but don't consider it cheating
I consider the fact that we'll break up anyway (anyway)
Based on all the shit that you don't appreciate
Me switching states, working hard, meeting dates
And you were thinking everything was sweet, piece of cake
Well, that all changed
What we had was big, but you gon' miss the small things
And that little cash I spent, that was small change
But above all things
I still love you
Just gotta do my own thing
I'm tired of arguin' and fightin' girl
Every night you keep callin' me with the same shit, I'm goin' insane
I swear I love you but this ain't right for us
I never thought it would end this way, it's gon' kill me to say
But you gotta
Pack your stuff, leave my keys
Get your shit, gotta go
Pack your stuff, leave my keys
Get your shit, gotta go
Pack your stuff, leave my keys
Get your shit, gotta go
Told you that I'm movin' on
You didn't, well you outta know

Now I go
I'll never come back
And when you call
I'll never call back
'Cause I got a new girl
Yeah, I got a new girl
Everything was all good
Then went all bad
No, I don't think 'bout the things that we had
'Cause I got a new girl
Yeah, I got a new girl15Embed
