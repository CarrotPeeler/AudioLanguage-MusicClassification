I know a man, a very incredible man
He's a big, tall man in a big black hat
A wolf in sheep's clothing, yet he looks like that
I know a man, get in touch if you can
You are what you are, I am what I am
You are what you are, uh-huh
I know a man, get in touch if you can
I know a man, a very incredible man
He's a big, tall man in a big black hat
A wolf in sheep's clothing, yet he looks like that
I know a man, get in touch if you can
I've been all around the world, look at me
I've been all around the world, can't you see?
I've been all around the world, look at me
Have people trying to emulate me
You are what you are, I am what I am
You are what you are, na, na-na-na, na-na-na, na, na, na
I've been all around the world, can't you see?
I've been all around the world, look at me
I've been all around the world
I've been all around the world
I've been all around the world
I've been all around the world
Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah-ah
You are what you are
You are what you are
You are what you are
