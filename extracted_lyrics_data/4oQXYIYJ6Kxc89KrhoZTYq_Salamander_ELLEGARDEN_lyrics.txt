1 ContributorSalamander LyricsThere ain't no fear
There ain't no hope
There ain't no right
There ain't no wrong
Just make it loud
Just make it loud
Just make it loud
I feel no touch
There ain't no past
There ain't no fate
There ain't no thoughts
There ain't no rules
Spoken words
Broken hearts
Instant dreams
Just let it slide, wasting time
Just keep it going and going
Just let it slide, wasting life
Just keep it rolling and rolling
Just make it loud, in your room
Just make it loud, no one cares
And just let it slide
Yeah
You might also likeThere ain't no pain
There ain't no help
There ain't no doubt
There ain't no name
Just make it fun
Just make it fun
Just make it fun
Carry on
There ain't no hate
There ain't no grace
There ain't no harm
There ain't no truth
Empty bowls
Springer falls
Lost and found
Just let it slide, wasting time
Just keep it going and going
Just let it slide, wasting life
Just keep it rolling and rolling
Just make it loud, in your room
Just make it loud, no one cares
And just let it slide
Now I hear it snows
This year is getting colder
How I feel inside
Losing my concentration
Now I need more time
Somehow I'll make through
I just need more time
Just let it slide, wasting time
Just keep it going and going
Just let it slide, wasting life
Just keep it rolling and rolling
Just make it loud in your room
Just make it loud, no one cares
And just let it slide
YeahEmbed
