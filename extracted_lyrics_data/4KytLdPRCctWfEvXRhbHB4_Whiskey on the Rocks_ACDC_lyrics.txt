Ooh
I've been drinkin' all night long
So long, baby, I'm gone
Ooh-sh, yeah

A-well, Bloody Mary, give me shiver from a shot
Set up the shooters, it's time for a drop
Gimme Old Jamaica, runnin' we come
Down at the hatch, Jack, the women and the fun

We drink a lot, that demon drop
This one's on me and here's to you

Whiskey on the rocks
A double or a shot
Whiskey on the rocks
Elixir from the top

You went drinking Mai Tais, Singapore sling
Beam me up, Jim, it's time to come in
I'll have one more a-'fore you close up the door
It's on the house, Mac, it's whiskey galore
You might also like
We drink a lot of that demon drop
This one's on me, here's mud in your eye

Whiskey on the rocks
A double or a shot
Whiskey on the rocks
Elixir from the top
Yeah, yeah-yeah, come on

He's gone seven sheets to the wind
Ha-ha-ha (Oh), fill him up, Joe!

Lock the door

Whiskey on the rocks
A double or a shot
Whiskey on the rocks
A double or a shot
Whiskey on the rocks
A double or a shot
Whiskey on the rocks
A double or a shot
I'm drinkin'
Whiskey on the rocks
I'll have my whiskey on the rocks
Gimme whiskey on the rocks
Keep it comin' on the rocks
Yeah
Pour me a double, here come trouble, whiskey on the rocks
A-whiskey on the rocks
