1 ContributorI Still Care LyricsNo, it wasn't long ago
When we were lovers too
But now that weve broken up
We thought that bein friends was cool
When we started to see other people
I thought it would be okay
Till I found that you fell in love
With another girl in just one day
So I called you up
Just to try to talk some sense in you
But of course you think Im jealous
Now I remember why were through
Boy, would you listen
Before your decision
Im just trying to be your friend, oh, ho, ho
Dont know why I can't stop thinkin bout you (I
Dont know why)
Ive warned you all that I could
But youre gonna do what you wanna do (Youre gonna do
What you wanna do)
I throw my hands in the air (Hey)
But I can't help it that I still care (Oh, you know I
Still care, boy, you know I do)
Now its only just a month
Shes pushing you away
She wants to leave you
She doesnt feel the same
How could someone act so cold
When you gave it all that you could
Maybe she didn't know how
To treat you like a real woman should
And just like that
You fell in love with another again
You must be crazy, boy
I dont even know where to begin
Cannot help feeling sorry (Oh, oh)
Dont know why it still bothers me
Im just trying to be your friend
I dont know why I can't stop thinkin bout you (Oh
Oh, oh)
Ive warned you all that I could (All that I could)
But youre gonna do what you wanna do (Gonna do what
You wanna do)
I throw my hands in the air (Yeah)
But I can't help it (No) that I still care (Ill
Always care, yes, I will)
Its not that simple when I tell you I care (Its not
That simple, no)
No, Im not in love with you, but I dont think its
Fair (Woo)
When I can see you sufferin, I can be that friend you
Only need
To keep you falling on your hands (But you choose to
Rush it instead)
I dont know why I can't stop thinkin bout you
(Oh...)
Ive warned you all that I could (All that I could)
But youre gonna do what you wanna do (Youre gonna do
What you wanna do)
I throw my hands in the air (Hands in the air)
But I can't help it that I still care (Can't help that
I still care, can't help that I still care about you)
I dont know why I can't stop thinkin bout you (I
Just can't stop thinkin about you, baby)
Ive warned you all that I could (All that I could)
But youre gonna do what you wanna do (But youre
Gonna do what you wanna do)
I throw my hands in the air (I throw my hands in the
Air)
But I can't help it that I still care (All I wanna do
Is be a friend to you, baby)
I throw my hands in the air (Hey, hey, hey, hey, yeah)
But I can't help it that I still care
Yeah, Ill always care
