6 ContributorsParadise Is Here Lyrics
You say you wanna live some
Move out into the fast lane
You say you need excitement
To make you come alive
Some place a million miles from
The shadows that surround you
I look for your attention
You're lost out in the future
Where lovers ask no questions
And shadows never fall
Some pilgrim bound for paradise
No compromise

'Cause paradise is here
It's time to stop your crying
The future is this moment
And not someplace out there
Tonight, I need your love
Don't talk about tomorrow

But right now, I need your loving
Right now, give it to me
Right now, I want your loving
Right now, now, now, now, now
You might also like
You talk about your new plans
To move on up the stairway
You dream about the high life
That's waiting for you there
A world of fame and fortune
Is just around the corner
But I don't need no high life
To make me feel a woman
And I don't need to reach for
No castles in the sky
Just put your arms around me
Oh, devour me

'Cause paradise is here
It's time to stop your crying
The future is this moment
And not someplace out there
Tonight, I need your love
Don't talk about tomorrow

But right now, I need your loving
Right now, give it to me
Right now, I want your loving
Right now
Oh I want your loving right now
Right now, right now
Ohh
Right now
Ohh, give your loving right now
Right now, right now
Right now, right now
Give it to me
Right now, right now
Give your loving
Right now, right now
OhhEmbed
