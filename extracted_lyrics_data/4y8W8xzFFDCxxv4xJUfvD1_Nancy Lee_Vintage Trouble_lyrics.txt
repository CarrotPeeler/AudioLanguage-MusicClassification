I HOPE THAT YOU SEE ME
I SEE YOU, NANCY LEE
I HOPE THAT YOU SEE ME
I KNOW I’M NOT THE ONLY OTHER MAN
WHO WANTS YOUR HAND TO BE IN HIS HAND
BUT I DON’T JUST WANT I NEED YOU
NANCY LEE
Country girl sitting on a porch squeezing lemons
Taking what’s given and making lemonade
I was tearing down dusty road back to the city
When I crossed her porch and there I stayed stayed
And I tell you
I won’t looking for it no but
It came hunting me
How do I get what I get
Honey stung the bee
I SEE YOU, NANCY LEE
I HOPE THAT YOU SEE ME
I SEE YOU, NANCY LEE
I HOPE THAT YOU SEE ME
I KNOW I’M NOT THE ONLY OTHER MAN
WHO WANTS YOUR HAND TO BE IN HIS HAND
BUT I DON’T JUST WANT I NEED YOU
NANCY LEE
You might also likeCity girls never brought what you were bringing
Precisely why I never fell in
She don’t car where around the world I’ve been sing
Nothing is nothing less it ends with amen
That’s why I tell you
I won’t looking for it no but
It came hunting me
How do I get what I get
From down on one knee
I SEE YOU, NANCY LEE
I HOPE THAT YOU SEE ME
I SEE YOU, NANCY LEE
I HOPE THAT YOU SEE ME
I KNOW I’M NOT THE ONLY OTHER MAN
WHO WANTS YOUR HAND TO BE IN HIS HAND
BUT I DON’T JUST WANT I NEED YOU
