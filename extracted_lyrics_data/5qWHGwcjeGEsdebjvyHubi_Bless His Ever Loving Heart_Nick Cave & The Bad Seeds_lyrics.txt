Bless his ever loving heart
Only he knows who you are
He may seem so very far
Bless his ever loving heart
And when you're feeling sad
And everywhere you look
You can't believe the things you see
When it all comes down so bad
And beauty lies exhausted in the streets

Hold his ever loving hand
Even when you do not understand
Sorrow has it's natural end
Hold his ever loving hand
And when you're feeling low
And everyone you meet
You can't believe the things they say
When there's no place left to go
Where someone isn't moving
You a little further down the way

Bless his ever loving heart
What you do is what you are
When it all comes down so hard
Bless his ever loving heart
Hold his ever loving hand
When it seems you ain't got a friend
Only he knows who you are and what you are
Bless his ever loving heart
