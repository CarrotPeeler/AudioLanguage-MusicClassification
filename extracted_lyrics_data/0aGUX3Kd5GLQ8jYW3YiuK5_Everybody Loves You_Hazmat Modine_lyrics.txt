1 ContributorEverybody Loves You LyricsEverybody loves you
Nobody don't
Everybody wants some but
Nobody wants
When I'm in the mood for
When I'm on the road
When I'm in the mood for
When I'm on the road
For your love
Everybody's watching
Don't want to judge
Everybody's listening
But they don't want to touch
Everyone's forming
No one suspects
Everybody's calling you
But no one connects
When I'm in the mood for
When I'm on the road
When I'm in the mood for
When I'm on the road
For your love

Nobody don't
Everybody wants some
But nobody wants
When I'm in the mood for
When I'm on the road
When I'm in the mood for
When I'm on the road
For your love
Here we go!Embed
