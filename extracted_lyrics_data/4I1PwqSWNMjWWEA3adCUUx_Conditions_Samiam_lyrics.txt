1 ContributorConditions LyricsIf i could be anywhere and feel at home and be without anyone without feeling alone and do anything knowing it's all right i'll keep you in mind don't want to spend my time looking ahead or back it keeps me busy just wondering where the hell i'm at i don't want to talk because i don't want to argue it'll just confuse me anyway i've got my reasons for not being understanding and saying all the fucked up things i say i've been holding back the motion in my mimd for so long i can't always tell when something has gone wrong if things get simple now i'd probably lose my mind little girl you're so afraid no matter what i say you don't believe meYou might also likeEmbed
