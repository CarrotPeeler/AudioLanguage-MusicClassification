4 ContributorsExclusively Lyrics
Yeah
Baby, I just wanna love you (Exclusively)
You know? (Exclusively, yeah, yeah)
You know, you be trippin' (Exclusively)
Ain't no one out there like this
Let me tell you something (Exclusively, yeah, yeah)

When we started out, girl, we weren't official
If I didn't see you every day it wasn't an issue
(Damn, look how we've grown
The only thing I spend my money on, yeah, yeah)
I didn't even used to tell you that I missed you
Now I'm rushing through my day just to be with you
(You're like a new drug I'm on
And I can't leave you alone, yeah, yeah)
Don't understand what's going on with me

Baby, you done changed me all around
Got me really thinking 'bout putting my pimp cup down
Exclusively (Exclusively, exclusively, yeah, yeah)
How I was living, I done packed it up
'Bout to trade the two-seater for a family truck
Exclusively (Exclusively, exclusively)
Exclusively, yeah, yeah
You might also like
Oh, I'm usually not the type to get caught up
Had to stop and think, rewind this thing up
Either I'm losing my mind or I'm falling in love
I don't wanna be, no, oh
(After looking for some strip club love) Oh
(Got thirty women in VIP off in the club)
I don't wanna have that baby, yeah
(Baby, you're all I'm tryna see, with you is where I wanna be)
I don't understand what's going on with me, yeah

Baby, you done changed me all around (All around yeah)
Got me really thinking 'bout putting my pimp cup down (Oh)
Exclusively (Exclusively, exclusively, yeah, yeah)
(I wanna love you exclusively, yeah, oh-oh-ooh)
How I was living, I done packed it up (I done packed it up)
'Bout to trade the two-seater for a family truck (Yes, I am, baby)
Exclusively (Exclusively, exclusively)
(Wanna love ya, gotta love ya)
Exclusively, yeah, yeah (Oh yeah)

Yeah, tired of playing around
Gotta shut this thing down like this
Yeah, I just wanna be with you
Yeah, so
Baby, you done changed me all around. (Yes, you have, baby)
Got me really thinking 'bout putting my pimp cup down (Oh)
Exclusively (Exclusively, exclusively, yeah, yeah)
(No more out all night long, letting the sun beat me home)
(I don't wanna do it to you, baby)
How I was living, I done packed it up
'Bout to trade a two-seater for a family truck
('Bout to trade in the Porsche)
Exclusively (Exclusively, yes I do, baby)
Exclusively, yeah, yeah
Baby, you done changed me all around. (I done gave it all up)
Got me really thinking 'bout putting my pimp cup down. (Ohhh)
Exclusively. (Exclusively, exclusively, yeah, yeah)
(Exclusively, yeah)
How I was living, I done packed it up
'Bout to trade the two-seater for a family truck
Exclusively (Yeah) (Exclusively) (Yeah) (Exclusively)
Exclusively, yeah, yeahEmbed
