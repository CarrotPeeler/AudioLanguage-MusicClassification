1 ContributorAhab Welcome To Hell LyricsDrink deep and choke on this bleeding briny wine
Bubbly shanties, gurgle-groans, your chums, abob, in time chant:
"The Peqoud's crew's in pieces that peer from peaks and waves
The fluted throats of fishes will be their scattered graves."
Jig to that, old shrivel, a lashed enhobbled dance
Mock man's quest to be the most prettiest, to mangle all the rest
And still that crazed raving trap-salt, spit, gnash-agasp:
"Death and devils! Bedeviled depths! Avast! Avast!"
Good-bye, God's blue sky
Come, black grip, cold fire
Whose mad heart will survive?
Dive! Dive! Dive! Dive!!!!
I want you to see what's dear to me, this soft ballet, what's oft melee
An abyss too rich for tricks of light and sound
Quiet ink
Where crusts crack
Where bones break
We'll linger deep while rot the quills and thread, harpoons and hemp, the unfair filigree that that binds you to me
Your soul will sink to hell, your body can bloat back to the birdsYou might also likeEmbed
