9 Contributors45 (Acoustic) Lyrics
1,2,3,4

Send away for a priceless gift
One not subtle, one not on the list
Send away for a perfect world
One not simply, so absurd
Cause in these times of doing what you're told
You keep these feelings, that no one knows

So whatever happened to the young man's heart?
It's swallowed by pain, as he slowly fell apart

And I'm staring down the barrel of a .45
I'm swimming through the ashes of another life
There's no real reason to accept the way things have changed
Staring down the barrel of a .45

Send a message to the unborn child
To keep your eyes open for a while
'Cause in a box high up on the shelf
That's left for you and no one else
There's a piece of a puzzle known as life
It's wrapped in guilt and sealed up tight

So whatever happened to the young man's heart?
It's swallowed by pain, as he slowly fell apart

And I'm staring down the barrel of a .45
I'm swimming through the ashes of another life
There's no real reason to accept the way things have changed
Staring down the barrel of a .45

'Cause everyone's pointing their fingers
You're always condemning me
Well, nobody knows what I believe
What I believe

And I'm staring down the barrel of a .45
I'm swimming through the ashes of another life
With no real reason to accept the way things have changed
Staring down the barrel
And I'm staring down the barrel of a .45
And I'm swimming through the ashes of another life
There is no real reason to accept the way things have changed
Staring down the barrel, yeah, of a .45
Yeah, of a .45
I'm staring down the barrel of a .45Embed
