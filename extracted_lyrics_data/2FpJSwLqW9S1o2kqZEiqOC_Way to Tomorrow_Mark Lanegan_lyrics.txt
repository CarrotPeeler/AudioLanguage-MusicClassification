2 ContributorsWay to Tomorrow Lyrics
Carry that weight, but it's too heavy, lord
Walk that mile, but it's too far to go
Out in the wintertime
Lost, I can't get over
Can't find my way to tomorrow

There's driving rain, there's ice and there's snow
No place to rest, nothing to know
Look for some better times
But I can't get over
Can't find my way to tomorrowYou might also likeEmbed
