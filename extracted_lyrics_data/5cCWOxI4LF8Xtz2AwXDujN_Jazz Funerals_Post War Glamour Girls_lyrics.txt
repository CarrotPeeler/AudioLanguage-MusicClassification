1 ContributorJazz Funerals LyricsI was made, I was cobbled together
Simple, forgettable action in the back of a Datsun
Now I nearly disappeared
Three years of my life being
Cut up and stitched up and
Cut up and stitched up
Cut up and
Some creep knee deep in the strap, he will spare me the pity
Of mother's meeting by the football pitch fonder committee
Hold me
It's all I ask, and tell me
It's alright, alright
On Christmas Eve you gave your love
Lay down with us, so 
On Christmas day you turned to stone
It happens to the best of us
Hold me, I'm weak
I'm waiting for the shake to kickstart
Me back into regular routinе
Your prayers on me
And no one's listеning, yeah
Yeah, no one's listening
You might also likeScatter my ashes up by the coffee machine
Mourn me every morning
While you're keeping it clean, you keep it clean for me
You always kept it clean and if the soup gets burnin'
Yeah, just bury me there
Commiserations, you 
And all your friends are waiting there
They're waiting there, this is what they say
"God bless your soul, if only for a day"
"God bless your soul, if only for a day"
Hold me, I'm weak
I'm waiting for the shake to kickstart
Me back into regular routine
Your prayers on me
And no one's listening, yeah
Yeah, no one's listening
Hold me, I'm weak
I'm waiting for the shake to kickstart
Me back into regular routine
Your prayers on me
And no one's listening, yeah
Yeah, no one's listeningEmbed
