1 ContributorCat Piss LyricsOn the longest day of the year I was married
And kissed my wife while she was being buried
(la la la la la la)
...I've been spending most my time
Living in a pastime paradise and I'm
Given opportunity to see the poor thing
And when I find my place in it, yeah, I know how to be
I got ... bad timing like a fake Rolex
I've been reincarnated, now you know how I'm rated X
Burned last time, cremated in fact
And I should have went through when they told me how to act
And I wish I had it in me to bring you back, true
My spot is a burial plot made for two
I got plenty of open space (la la la)
And I'm hoping if you had to go away, you'd ask a better place
Needle myself, on point like a thumbtack
Kiss myself in the arm and then jump back
I'm going to go nut from the inside, but it's hard
I dug a little hole for you - at the graveyard
You gotta be brave, God, help yourself (la la)
Whether or not we can be alone together
It was all so perfect when you were here, but then you left
So high up in the sky and out of breath
You might also like"You went away"
I only fully understood after you were gone, you meant
All that could be realized with a visit to the monument
Teach me about the birds and the bees, while
I pray aloud in the words of a freestyle
(la) Can you dig it?  Carry me away, goin' on
I play the head of cheese and introduce you to God
It's easy to write about hard and you see
I had a fucked up dream that I was in all again
... ... ... I'm so indecisive
I think taking a chance is what the meaning of life is
And I'm lost but inspired by the aura that radiates
From the soul of a girl named Fatal
The weight'll be worth withstanding the endeavor
Where we can be reunited at the gravesite forever
We could be together if you could have stayed for real
The weak will endure (la la) 'cause we are made of steel...
"You went away"Embed
