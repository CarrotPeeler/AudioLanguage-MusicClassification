Working, working up a black sweat
Working, working up a black sweat
Working, working up a black sweat
Working, working up a black sweat

I don't want to take my clothes off
But I do
Ooo, I don't want to turn nobody on
Unless it's you
Ah, I don't want to dance too hard, baby
But this is a groove
Yes, it is, funky
I'm hot, and I don't care who knows it
I got a job to do
(Thank you, Yes, Come On - Uh!)

I'm working
Working up a black sweat
I'm working, ooo
Working up a black sweat
I'm working, oooo

Working, working up a black sweat
Working, working up a black sweat
You might also like
I don't want to break your pride
Pride, um
But I got to
'Bout to hurt 'em
Go on, hurt 'em, boy
You bet take your woman and hide her
Hide
Ooo, because I'm about to
Show 'em what you're 'bout to do, boy
Got to, got to
Show you what's really good
Show you what's really good
Break you off like you knew I would
Like you knew I would
I got a brand new dance
I got my brand new dance
And it's called a... uh!

Working
Working up a black sweat
I'm working, ooo
Working up a black sweat
I'm working, ahh!
Ooh!
Working, working up a black sweat
Working, working up a black sweat
Working, working up a black sweat
Working
Breakdown

You can act hard if you want to
This groove will make you sweet, um
You'll be screaming like a white lady
When I count to three
1, 2, 3

Working, oo
Working up a black sweat
I'm working, ohh
Working up a black sweat, ohh
Working
Working up a black
Ooo

Working
Working up a black, hey
