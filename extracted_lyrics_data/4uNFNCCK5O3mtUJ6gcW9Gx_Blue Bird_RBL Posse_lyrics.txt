There's a blue bird on my shoulder
There's a blue bird on my shoulder
There's a blue bird on my shoulder
There's a blue bird on my shoulder

Man, there's a blue bird on my shoulder, can I kill it?
Man, there's a blue bird on my shoulder, can I kill it?
There's a blue bird on my shoulder
Man, there's a blue bird on my shoulder, can I kill it?
Man, there's a blue bird on my shoulder, can I kill it?
There's a blue bird on my shoulder

Back on the scene, crispy and clean
It's two niggas with two Glock 17's
And I give a fuck 'cause you might catch a buck
You fucking with a nigga going crazy like Chuck
D, I'm a G tryna stay sucka free
The nigga nigga Black from the P-O-double-S-E
Test me, when I'm on the jackin'
One time was rolling deep when it was time for some action
Now I'm actin', shhh, keep it on the down low
Run yo', run yo' ass out the muthafuckin' jungle
And there's a blue bird on my shoulder
So I gots to drop him to the streets and run his bitch ass over
You might also like
Man, there's a blue bird on my shoulder, can I kill it?
Man, there's a blue bird on my shoulder, can I kill it?
There's a blue bird on my shoulder
Man, there's a blue bird on my shoulder, can I kill it?
Man, there's a blue bird on my shoulder, can I kill it?
There's a blue bird on my shoulder

It still gets deeper and deeper
The deeper in this game that it get
It got these young niggas actin' sick
Lettin' loose on a nigga
Even if they figured you was bigger
They would still be your grave digger
Time keeps on ticking, ticking
My baby's getting older and her mama's steady trippin'
Saying I'm always with my clique
And she be like, "You make me, you make me sick"
From rags to riches
Now that a nigga don't fuck with no bitches
Standing with the 50 pop out sellin' boulders, a soldier
With a blue bird on the shoulder, and uh...

Man, there's a blue bird on my shoulder, can I kill it?
Man, there's a blue bird on my shoulder, can I kill it?
There's a blue bird on my shoulder
Man, there's a blue bird on my shoulder, can I kill it?
Man, there's a blue bird on my shoulder, can I kill it?
There's a blue bird on my shoulder
I watch you slip, slip, slip then fall
And make my hands into cars and turn your pockets
Into some parking stalls
'Cause a nigga gotta keep some long mail
So I be de-barge-in' in the doors like my name was El
But what the hell? I think I need to let that shit go
Try to make a rap and come up off a funky flow
I didn't know, though, that shit wouldn't come that easy
Record companies think I'm pussy 'cause they all tryna beat me
Skeeze me, way these hoodrats do it daily
Have that nigga's baby and tellin' my homies "maybe"
This shit gon' have somebody gettin' hurt
And best believe my first visit is gonna be that punk ass blue bird

Man, there's a blue bird on my shoulder, can I kill it?
Man, there's a blue bird on my shoulder, can I kill it?
There's a blue bird on my shoulder
Man, there's a blue bird on my shoulder, can I kill it?
Man, there's a blue bird on my shoulder, can I kill it?
There's a blue bird on my shoulder

Just call me the city buses, I got something waiting in the cuts
For them sucka ass niggas who be tryna stick up shit
Like deodorant; the tre-eight, I be holdin' it
I treat that ass like clean clothes and watch me start folding shit
And cook that ass like minute rice, I'm nothing nice
I'm still stressing 'cause of the Frisco vice
But they better have they Nike shoes on
'Cause them high-tech boots is the wrong shoes for the drug zone
Oh, it's on
You won't catch me, so don't let me
Pull out my gat on them dogs that you sent to fetch me
I'll have them puppies dropping like turds
And come back out the cut and start bustin' at the blue bird
Man, there's a blue bird on my shoulder, can I kill it?
Man, there's a blue bird on my shoulder, can I kill it?
There's a blue bird on my shoulder
Man, there's a blue bird on my shoulder, can I kill it?
Man, there's a blue bird on my shoulder, can I kill it?
There's a blue bird on my shoulder
Man, there's a blue bird on my shoulder, can I kill it?
Man, there's a blue bird on my shoulder, can I kill it?
There's a blue bird on my shoulder
Man, there's a blue bird on my shoulder, can I kill it?
Man, there's a blue bird on my shoulder, can I kill it?
There's a blue bird on my shoulder4Embed
