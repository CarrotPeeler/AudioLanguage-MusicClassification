4 ContributorsFriday Night Lyrics(Intro)
Mmm
Oh yeah
Ohhh
(Chorus)
What's goin' on, it's a Friday night
Haven't any ideas but I hoped I might
Be out in the club not all up in a TV
Holla, I'm watchin'
What's goin' on, 'bout to take what's mine
Get me outta this chair before I change my mind
Instead of me feelin' sorry for myself
Gonna get me somethin'
(Verse 1)
You were, supposed to, make the plans it's not like
We got, all the girls, waitin' on us tonight
Wrong side of ten and nobody's pickin' up the phone, nothin's goin' on
And you're sittin' tellin' me there's no alcohol
And the cigarettes are gone
(Chorus)
What's goin' on, it's a Friday night
Haven't any ideas but I hoped I might
Be out in the club not all up in a TV
Holla, I'm watchin'

Get me outta this chair before I change my mind

Gonna get me somethin' tonight, oh
(Verse 2)
Desperate, it's so late, yet I'm so up for it
Stupid, wastin' time, dammed if I can't get
Up outta here on a main line into unknown before I change my mind
If I had do I'd do it all by myself
Time to take what's mine
(Chorus)
What's goin' on, it's a Friday night
Haven't any ideas but I hoped I might
Be out in the club not all up in a TV
Holla, I'm watchin'
What's goin' on, 'bout to take what's mine
Get me outta this chair before I change my mind
Instead of me feelin' sorry for myself
Gonna get me somethin' tonight, oh

Just stand up, da da da da da da da daaa da
Just stand up, da da da da da da da daaa da
Just stand up, da da da da da da da daaa da
Just stand up, da da da da da da da daaa da
Same old same old every night, uh
Regretting what I coulda done with my life
Sick and tired of bein' in when I wanna be out, uh
Well you know that
Wrong side of ten and nobody's pickin' up the phone, nothin's goin' on
And you're sittin' tellin' me there's no alcohol
And the cigarettes are gone
(Chorus)
What's goin' on, it's a Friday night
Haven't any ideas but I hoped I might
Be out in the club not all up in a TV
Holla, I'm watchin'
What's goin' on, 'bout to take what's mine
Get me outta this chair before I change my mind
Instead of me feelin' sorry for myself
Gonna get me somethin' tonight
