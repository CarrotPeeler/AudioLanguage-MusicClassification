4 ContributorsNo One Knows Lyrics
These visions in my head, the friendly faces
I don't know maybe it's me
It feels like they're in my mind and feasting on my brain
Ooh, don't you feel the same?

No one knows what I know when I know that I'm done (No)
No one knows that I know when I know that I'm done (No)

I'm trapped in my DNA, no time to waste
Spies are in my closet and under my bed
I'm losing this scary game, crack me like the whip
Please crack me sane

No one knows what I know when I know that I'm done (No)
No one knows that I know when I know that I'm done (No)
No one knows what I know when I know that I'm done (No)
No one knows that I know when I know that I'm done (No)

No one knows what I know when I know that I'm done (No)
No one knows that I know when I know that I'm done (No)
No one knows what I know when I know that I'm done (No)
No one knows that I know when I know that I'm done (No)You might also likeEmbed
