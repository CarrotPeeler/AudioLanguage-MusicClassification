Again
Again, this couldn't happen again
This is that once-in-a-lifetime, this is the thrill divine
What's more, this never happened before
Though I have prayed for a lifetime
That such as you would suddenly be mine
Mine to hold as I'm holding you now, and yet, never so near
Mine to have when the now and the here disappear
What matters, dear, for when this doesn't happen again
We'll have this moment forever, but never, never againYou might also likeEmbed
