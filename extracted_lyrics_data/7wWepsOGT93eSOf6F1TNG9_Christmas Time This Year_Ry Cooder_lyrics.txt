1 ContributorChristmas Time This Year Lyrics
Now our boys and girls will be here soon, coming home from war
I'm so glad it's Christmas time this year
But they'll be going back to war again I fear
Can't they stay for Christmas time this year?
Now Johnny ain't got no legs and Billy ain't got no face
Do they know it's Christmas time this year?
But Tommy looks about the same but his mind is gone
Does he know it's Christmas time this year?

Now when is Santa coming 'round? 'Cause I got some requests
I bet he knows it's Christmas time this year
Military personnel might not be on his list
Don't he know it's Christmas time this year?
All I want is two good arms so I can hold my kids
Then they'll know it's Christmas time this year
I'd like a mouth so I can kiss my honey on her lips
And then she'll know it's Christmas time this year

Because it's Christmas time, Christmas time
Yes it's merry Christmas time
Everybody stand up tall and cheer
Our children will be coming home in plastic bags I fear
And then we'll know it's Christmas time this year
So thank you Mr. President for your kind words and deeds
There's just one thing I'd like for you to hear
Take this war and shove it up your Crawford, Texas ass
And then you'll know it's Christmas time this year
That's when you'll know itYou might also likeEmbed
