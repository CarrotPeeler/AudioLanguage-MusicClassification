Where have you gone?

Every day I've been grieving all day for you
Standing and recalling when there's nothing but us
Every life has an end, every love has an end
Only we were so young to accept the place that we met
I know you were struggling to pretend to be bright
I got your precious soul forever in mind
Some people forgot you and some people remembered you for a lifetime
Your presence alone was the best gift

The worst thing happens when you are already in heaven
Know you're a featherless angel
I'm your other self, our line will never break
But where the hell are you at?

Where have you gone?
Where have you gone?
Pray for your peace
Don't ever forgive me
Where have you gone?
Where have you gone?
Pray for your peace
Don't ever forgive me
You might also like
First it was sadness, then anger
You left a burden to your most important person
Even if I can't forgive you
I just look at your form from the other side of the bridge that I can't cross
Still, you'll watch over me and regret it
And I decided to keep you inside me
I got a new life

The worst thing happens when you are already in heaven
Know you're a featherless angel
I'm your other self, our line will never break
But where the hell are you at?

Where have you gone?
Where have you gone?
Pray for your peace
Don't ever forgive me
Where have you gone?
Where have you gone?
Pray for your peace
Don't ever forgive me

One thing I should tell you, I'll live as your
Alter ego for the rest of my life, I wonâ€™t leave
May you sleep in peace, you were everyone's hope
Where have you gone?
Where have you gone?
Pray for your peace
Don't ever forgive me
Where have you gone?
Where have you gone?
Pray for your peace
Don't ever forgive meEmbed
