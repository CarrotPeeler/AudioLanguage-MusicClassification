24 ContributorsMy Lovenote Has Gone Flat LyricsMake it slower
Oh, my eyes are burning red
And thoughts of murder run through my head
Oh, my eyes are bloodshot red
Put a bullet right through my head
I am my own bomb, I am my own slave
I hate my life now, and all of this is because of you
I wanna die
Hate myself
Anyone listening
I wanna die
Hate myself
Anyone listening
I wanna die
Hate myself
Anyone listening
I wanna die
I hate myself
I hate myself, I hate myself, I hate myself, I hate myself
I hate myself, I hate myself, I hate myself, I hate myself

No
I wanna lay low, but you want a funeral
You are a lie, and I am the liar
I am a liar
All you can go fuck yourselves
All this poison that's in my brain
Has given false hope it's such a shame
I wanna die
Hate myself
Anyone listening
I wanna die
Hate myself
Anyone listening
I wanna die
Hate myself
Anyone listening
I wanna die
I hate myself
I hate myself, I hate myself, I hate myself, I hate myself
I hate myself, I hate myself, I hate myself, I hate myself
I'm done, this is my last call
I'm done, this is my last call
You better take me
Just take me, take me
Just take me away
God, just take me
Just take me
Just take me away
Take me away
Take me away1Embed
