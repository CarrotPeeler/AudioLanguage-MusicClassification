6 ContributorsLove Is a Shield Lyrics
Love is a shield to hide behind
Love is a field to grow inside
And when I sometimes close my eyes
My mind starts spinning around
Love is a baby in a mother's arms
Love is your breath which makes me warm
And when I sometimes close my eyes
My mind starts spinning around

There is a feeling that flows through me
When you are near you make it real
And we could live for this ideal
And all the pictures we run through
Seem to be perfect, seem to be true
But nothing is quite forever, especially staying together

Love is a shield to hide behind
Love is a field to grow inside
And when I sometimes close my eyes
My mind starts spinning around
Love is a baby in a mother's arms
Love is your breath which takes me warm
And when I sometimes close my eyes
My mind starts spinning around

Love is a field to grow inside
And when I sometimes close my eyes
My mind starts spinning around
Love is a baby in a mother's arms
Love is your breath which takes me warm
And when I sometimes close my eyes
My mind starts spinning around

I do not care now what comes along
What counts is us no matter what will be
Just this naivety
The changing words we're taking in
Seem to be perfect, seem to win
But nothing is still forever, especially staying together

Love is a shield to hide behind
Love is a field to grow inside
And when I sometimes close my eyes
My mind starts spinning around
Love is a baby in a mother's arms
Love is your breath which takes me warm
And when I sometimes close my eyes
My mind starts spinning aroundEmbed
