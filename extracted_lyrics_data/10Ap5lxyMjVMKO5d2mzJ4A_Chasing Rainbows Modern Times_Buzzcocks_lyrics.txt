Stop, start, go, people fast and slow
Chasing rainbows, modern times
Everyone I know, always on the go
Chasing rainbows, modern times

Well, if it's something complicated in your mind
In a world that's unforgiving, hard to find
In your mind, modern times

Chasing rainbows, chasing rainbows
Chasing rainbows, modern times


Well, if it's something complicated in your mind
In a world that's unforgiving, hard to find
In your mind, modern times

Chasing rainbows, chasing rainbows
Chasing rainbows, modern times
Chasing rainbows, chasing rainbows
Chasing rainbows, modern times

In a world that's unforgiving, a world that's unforgiving
Modern times, in your mind
In a world that's unforgiving, a world that's unforgiving
Modern times, in your mind
In a world that's unforgiving, a world that's unforgiving
Chasing rainbows, chasing rainbows
Modern times, in your mind
Chasing rainbows, chasing rainbows
Modern timesEmbed
