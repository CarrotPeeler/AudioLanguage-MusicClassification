6 ContributorsRequiem Lyrics
Man watching video
The heart keeps on ticking
He doesn't know why
He's just cattle for slaughter

The requiem
The requiem
The requiem

When the meaningful words
When they cease to function
When there's nothing to say
When will it start worrying you?

The requiem
The requiem
The requiem

Only a hint of religion
I'm sensing spirits of depravity
The sound of breaking glass
This is the reflection
You might also like
The requiem
