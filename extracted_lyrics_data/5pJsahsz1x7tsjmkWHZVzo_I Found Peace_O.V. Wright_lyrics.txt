1 ContributorI Found Peace Lyrics
I found peace in the love of my woman
I found peace in the love of my girl
I found peace in the love of my woman
Now I can face, now I can face
The world, whooo

My whole life was filled with sadness
Sorrow and confusion were all I knew
But she brought a joy, that pushed back the sadness
Brought understanding, when I was confused
She lifted the weight of the world from my shoulders
Now I feel like I've been born all over

I found peace in the love of my woman
I found peace in the love of my girl
I found peace in the love of my woman
Now I can face, now I can face
Now I can face the whole world, yeah

If it hadn't been for the love of her
Lord knows where I'd be today
Heading down a road of self-destruction
But her love made me change my ways, whoo
Thank the girl for helping me to see
Thank the Lord for sending her to me

When a man and women find true love

I found peace in the love of my woman
I found peace in the love of my girl
