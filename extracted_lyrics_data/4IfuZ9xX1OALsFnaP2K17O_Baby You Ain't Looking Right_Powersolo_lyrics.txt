1 ContributorBaby, You Ain’t Looking Right LyricsBaby, you ain't﻿ lookin right
You ain't lookin right
Baby, I don't wanna fight
I don't wanna fight all night
Baby, you dress too tight
You dress too tight, alright
Baby, you eat too much
You eat too much, You eat a lot!
I might be crazy and I might be wild
But baby I ain't blind
Let me hold your hand
Tell me what's on your mind
Baby take your time!
I might be crazy and I might be wild
But baby I ain't blind
Let me hold your hand
Tell me what's on your mind
Baby take your time!
Baby, you ain't﻿ lookin right
You ain't lookin right
Baby, I don't wanna fight
I don't wanna fight all night
Baby, you dress too tight
You dress too tight, alright
Baby, you eat too much
You eat too much, You eat a lot!

But baby I ain't blind

Tell me what's on your mind
Baby take your time!Embed
