5 ContributorsThe Social Network Song (Oh Oh Uh Oh Oh) Lyrics
Ooooh, ooh ooh
(I like)

Are you ready for a little chat?
And a song about the Internet
It's a story ‘bout a social door
You’ve never seen before
If you wanna be seen by everyone
Wanna be in the dream and have some fun
If you wanna be on the hook
Then simply take a look

Oh oh, uh, oh oh
Everybody loves you so
Ooh ooh, uh, oh oh
Everybody that you know

Do you wanna be more than just a friend?
Do you wanna play cyber sex again?
If you wanna come to my house
Then click me with your mouse
You might also like
Hello, uh, oh oh
Never gonna let you go

Your logging in, then it begins
And your computer is waking you
Taking your time away
The scene is right for social light
You're on the Internet, anywhere
Anytime, night and day

Oh oh, uh, oh oh *(I like)*
Everybody loves you so
Ooh ooh, uh, oh oh *(Mi piace)*
Never gonna let you go

So you wanna make love with me
Am I really your cup of tea?
Are you really the one that’s you
And am I really me?

Oh oh, uh, oh oh *(I like)*
Everybody loves you so
Social network, oh *(Mi piace)*
Never gonna let you go
You’re login’ in with just a friend
But soon the Internet's
Beeping and peeping around the bend
We used to greet friends on the street
But now it’s googling, giggling, gaggling
When we meet

Beep beep, uh, oh oh
"How about a little chat?"
(Oh oh, network fans)
Meet ya' at the internet
Do you really like politics?
Wanna talk about dirty tricks?
Are you really a sex machine
Or just a beauty queen?
Everybody is better than before
Everybody is calling out for more
Everybody in Cyber-ville
Is knocking on your door

Beep beep, uh, oh oh *(I like)*
Everybody does a show
Ooh ooh, uh, oh oh *(Mi piace)*
If you like it click and go
Now you know it is easy loggin' in
For a little more fun and cyber sin
Wanna know what the net's about
The hard part's loggin' out

Ooh ooh, uh, oh oh
Now I've got a million friends
Goodbye, network fans
This is how the story ends
Ooh ooh, beep beepEmbed
