2 ContributorsHappily Delayed LyricsCan you tell me where to go
Where to look to find the remedy
How come memories are sweeter than reality
(ask yourself cause you're alone)
Ask yourself you're on your own
In a place where you don't want to be
Ask me where i've been
Ask me what i've seen
I will be brief
I need relief
What was the saying
I think it's getting late
And i'm happily delayed
Afraid of being afraid again
Answers coming late
I'm happily delayed
Afraid of being afraid again
Answers coming late
Can you learn how to say no
To protect me from insanity
How come mysteries
Are buried deep inside
Indeed
I feel your fear
It's clear
Come here

I think it's getting late
And i'm happily delayed
Afraid of being afraid again
Answers coming late
I'm happily delayed
Afraid of being afraid again
Answers coming late
