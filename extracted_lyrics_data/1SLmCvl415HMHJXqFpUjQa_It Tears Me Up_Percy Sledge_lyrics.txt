6 ContributorsIt Tears Me Up Lyrics
I see you walk with him
I see you talk to him
It tears me up
It tears me up
And start my eyes to cryin'
Oh, oh, I can't stop cryin'

I see him kiss your lips
Squeeze your fingertips
It tears me up
It tears me up
I feel like I'm dyin'
Oh, oh, I must be dyin'

It's a cold, cold world I'm livin' in
I turn my back, and there you are with my best friend
Oh, sometimes we pass on the street, darlin'
And you looked at me as if to say, "I'm sorry, my sweet"
Maybe just sayin' "I'm sorry" would be enough
But then you'd look back at him with your perfect smile
And that'd make me feel kind of rough
Oh darlin', it tears me up
You might also like
I see you smile at him
You'll never tire of him
It tears me up
It tears me up
But there ain't nothin I can do now
Baby, can't you see I'm still in love with you?
Oh, can't you see I'm still in love with you, baby?

Still waitin for something that I cannot have
Oh, baby, nothin' tears me up so bad
Can't you see that I'm still in love with you, baby?
Oh, that tears me up so bad now, babyEmbed
