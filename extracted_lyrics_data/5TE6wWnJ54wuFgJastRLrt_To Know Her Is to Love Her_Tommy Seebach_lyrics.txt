2 ContributorsFarewell Lyrics
This Edgar Allen Poe, I'm dope
The pulpit says by Satan
Saint Damien the angriest anarchist
If you really wanna step to this I gotta fuck you quick, then I pistol-whip my sanity
'Cause I can handle the life God handed me
Look what this industry did to me
You ain't no kin to me, I'd rather see you covered in blood
Think I give a fuck you cunt? I hate your motherfucking guts
Make your eyeballs bust pus, leaking all throughout your orifices
As God forgives, it's not my bliss and your severed head sucks my dick
I'm sicker than syphilis, Geno Cultshit
Sebaceous with a slit wrist stabbing your bitch
'Cause the hating is evident from thеse pussy fucks who are relеvant
Tell me I won't be hesitant to show up at your residence
And in your bed place the head of an elephant
And farewell I'm on my way to Hell
Don't embalm my body, watch it decay and swell
Te-Te-Tell my mother that I love her but her baby boy done lost it
Took the dried bones and threw 'em in the closet

Farewell 'cause I'm on my way to Hell
Mutilate my body to the sound of church bells
Yeah, yeah, cut me up now
Yeah, yeah, cut me up now
Farewell 'cause I'm on my way to Hell
Mutilate my body to the sound of church bells
Yeah, yeah, cut me up now
Yeah, yeah, cut me up now
You might also like
Fuck a casket, I don't need it
I'm back to Hell, I'm defeated
Sacrifice my body then free my soul
Hack my limbs, don't leave me whole
Cleanse the temple, just let me bleed
Release the crows and watch 'em feed
A light will beam and the ground will open
You kill the prophet, you show devotion
Now eat my skin then burn the bones
Spread the ashes all across your home
Spread 'em lightly and anoint the children
Eyeballs nailed to the ceiling
Fuck the cross 'cause I rep the truth
It's deep embedded, I am the proof
We speak the words that Garrett gave us
We bring the Kool-Aid in different flavors
Slice me open and I'll be your savior
Electrifying like I fuck a taser
Keep my heart in a fridge for later
Store my brains in an incubator
Fuck a traitor, my cult will follow
Grip your ore and now your body's hollow
Rock a mask since the blinded witness
Slay me now and you'll be forgiven
Jump with me into the fire
Where we shall burn and they call me sire
And life is false and your god's a liar
Slimming meat suit hanging from a wire
Grab the Buck knife, filet my flesh
Or shoot me to death like David Koresh
Let's burn this bitch down before I go
Back to Hell, that's all I know
Farewell 'cause I'm on my way to Hell
Mutilate my body to the sound of church bells
Yeah, yeah, cut me up now
Yeah, yeah, cut me up now
Farewell 'cause I'm on my way to Hell
Mutilate my body to the sound of church bells
Yeah, yeah, cut me up now
Yeah, yeah, cut me up now

Give me your blood, let me come to the light
Drinking the blood of a prophet deceased
Open my body like all of the victims of H.H. Holmes fucking memories
Smash my head against the fuckin' wall, I got nothing left to lose, I ain't got no homies
Drinking holy water like a demon into suicide and my body got fucking over like I'm unholy
Like Aleister Crowley giving you all of the knowledge you wanted in life
Never tell another motherfucker what you witness, you will die by the sight worse than a shark bite
Chopping me to nothing like you're Tommy Pitera
Dying with a smile like I'm Robert De Niro
You'll be in a puddle, not the place in my temple, inside of black trash bags like Anthony Spero
Never found me like I'm Houdini, vigilante me like Warren Beatty
Hang me from a tree like Brendan Fraser
Fuck and become more, keeping me bleeding
Leave me with a Colombian necktie, red blood dripping down my eyes like Jet Li
Fuck your fam and fuck your crew and fuck you too, just murder me
Spreading my carcass all over the nation like the population of the Freemasons
Tell me you're proper ho, bet I'll come back to life with the machete like Jason
End my life but free my soul, stab wounds bigger than bullet holes
Speaking wisdom y'all don't know, I am nothing, set in stone
Farewell 'cause I'm on my way to Hell
Mutilate my body to the sound of church bells
Yeah, yeah, cut me up now
Yeah, yeah, cut me up now
Farewell 'cause I'm on my way to Hell
Mutilate my body to the sound of church bells
Yeah, yeah, cut me up now
Yeah, yeah, cut me up now

Hard. It’s hard, it’s hard… only first, only at first is it hard. It’s hard only at first. Living, you, you’re looking at death. It only looks … living is much, much more difficult. Raising up every morning, and not knowing what’s going to be the night’s bringing. It’s much more difficult. It’s much more difficult. I just want to say something to everyone that I see that is standing around and are crying. This is nothing to cry about. This is something we should all rejoice about. We should be happy about this. They always told us that we should cry when you’re coming into this world, but when we’re leaving and we’re leaving it peaceful … I'll tell you, we should be happy about thisEmbed
