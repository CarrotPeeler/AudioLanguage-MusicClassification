10 ContributorsStranger Inside Lyrics
This day could be the worst one yet
I just won't relax, I can't catch my breath
Because I'm sick and tired of "You'll be fine"
Well, how do you know? Can you read minds?

So take it while you can, so you can meet demands
My insanity is what you thrive on
So rip it from my soul, so everyone will know in the end
We were never friends

Have you ever felt lost inside
So unloved within, that you almost died?
Have you ever stepped out of the light
And realized there's a stranger inside?

Don't push your ignorance on me
I'm not unrehearsed to your jealousy
And I know you think I don't see the signs
Well, how do you know? Do I look blind?

So take it while you can, so you can meet demands
My breakdown is what you thrive on
So rip it from my soul, so everyone will know in the end
I'm the break, you're the bend

Have you ever felt lost inside
So unloved within, that you almost died?
Have you ever stepped out of the light
And realized there's a stranger inside?

Stranger inside!

Have you ever felt lost inside
So unloved within, that you almost died?
Have you ever stepped out of the light
And realized there's a stranger inside?

Have you ever felt lost inside?
Have you ever stepped out of the light
And realized there's a stranger inside?Embed
