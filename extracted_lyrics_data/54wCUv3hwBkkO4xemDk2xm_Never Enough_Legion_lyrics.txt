10 ContributorsNever Enough Lyrics
Mm
When you solid you solid, ain't no ending, know what I mean?
After the grave, the work you put in supersedes your physical existence, haha
I'm tryna inherit what's mines
Ain't a playa but I run my game tight (Yup)
Seen a dollar, so you know my money right
Legacy is the throne you build, the light you leave behind
Ground you stand on, where you come from
What you done done, kingdom not forgotten

Forever is never enough
Mm, forever is never enough
Forever is nеver enough
Forevеr is never enough, forever is never enough

This is manifesting when you handling lessons
Stay in tune, understanding your blessings, but be aware
For the ones that whisper in ears, all the stunners
And the gunners that sit in the rear scoping your moves
It's beyond a hater hoping you lose, there's nothin' worse
Than an ignorant, emotional dude, women too
Tryin' to tell the youngins finish your school, knowledge is wealth
Especially when it's knowledge of self, soak it up
Showin' growth is when you low in the cut, it's more appealin'
It's a war when you all in your feelings, find you a zone
Found time to find me my own fountain of youth
It's the truth, every house ain't a home, there's no excuse
Be humble when you hustle, but get it, gotta live it
In a Lambo or low in a Civic, it's them digits
That multiply when placing a pie, no lie
I've been poppin' off since Doe or Die (Doe or Die)

Forever is never enough
Mm, forever is never enough
Forever is never enough
Forever is never enough, forever is never enough (Yo, Maybach Music)

Went from not having a lot and now I'm on a yacht (Huh)
Getting money off the top and don't know when it stop
I'm 'bout to purchase all the churches and the chicken spots
I'm down with merging every furnace, really make it hot (Boss)
See, I respect you getting paper any place you got
Fuck where you from 'cause all that matters that you make the top
Niggas tripping, I keep a pistol for Nipsey and Pac
Small circle, you cross the line and get put in a box (Woo)
The rims is spinning, all them Benzes keep bending the block (Ugh)
Them bitches waving, I'm engaging and spending a lot (Hahahaha)
Niggas dissing, come up missing, better listen to pop
Fuck 'em all, crank up the cars, we peeling the tops
Sun shinin', never some timin', my gun by me
Niggas study all the moves we making, so underline it
Pistols pointed at your person was the point intended (Ugh)
So when you really 'bout your business, come and see the biggest (Maybach Music)

Forever is never enough
Mm, forever is never enough
Forever is never enough
Forever is never enough, forever is never enough15Embed
