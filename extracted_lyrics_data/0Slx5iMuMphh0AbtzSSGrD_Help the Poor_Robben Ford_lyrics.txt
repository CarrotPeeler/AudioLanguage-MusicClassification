Won't you help poor me
Have a heart, won't you, baby
Listening to my plea
I need all your love, I need your care
I need all of the love you can spare
Help the poor, help the poor
Won't you help poor me
Say you will
Say you'll help me on
I can't make it no further in this world alone
I lost all my courage 'til I found you
Got what I need to see me through
Help the poor, help the poor
Won't you help poor me
You're my inspiration
You could make me a king
You don't come to my rescue
I'll never be anything
Help the poor, help the poor
Won't you help poor me
Have a heart, won't you, baby
Listening to my plea
I'm begging with tears in my eyes
Somethin' you must realize
Help the poor, help the poor
Won't you help poor me
You might also likeYou're my inspiration
You could make me a king
You don't come to my rescue
I'll never be anything
Help the poor, help the poor
Won't you help poor me
Have a heart, won't you, baby
Listening to my plea
I lost all my courage 'til I found you
Got what I need to see me through
Help the poor, help the poor
Won't you help poor me
Mmm, help the poor
Won't you help poor me
Help the poor, help the poorEmbed
