1 ContributorThick Like Mississippi Mud LyricsThe whiskey and the women
They can drop you to your knees
Hey I say good whiskey and the women
They can drop you to your knees
Man been hunting lord
Since Adam got a hold of Eve
Some people think I'm stone crazy
They think I've lost my mind
Some people think I'm crazy
But I'm doing just fine
Nobody wants to break their own rules
But they have no problem breaking mine
I've been around the world
I know, I know the world is round
I've been around the world
Hey I know the world is around
You know those blues have took my life
And turned it upside down
The smoke is getting thick
Thick like Mississippi mud
Oh the smoke is getting thicker
Thick like Mississippi mud
That's how many people at his party
Ohhh I can't even get drunk
You might also likeI've been around the world
I know, I know the world is round
I've been around the world
Hey I know the world is around
You know those blues have took my life
And turned it upside downEmbed
