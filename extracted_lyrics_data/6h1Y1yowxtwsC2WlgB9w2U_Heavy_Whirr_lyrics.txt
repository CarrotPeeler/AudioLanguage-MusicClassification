Fold onto the floor, the walls are peeling
Sneer at sleep up to the ceiling
Immerse myself into reverie

No time to unwind, sleep will not soothe me
Sneer at sleep up to the ceiling
Immerse myself into reverie
Sneer at sleep up to the ceiling
Immerse myself into reverie
Sneer at sleep up to the ceilingYou might also like2Embed
