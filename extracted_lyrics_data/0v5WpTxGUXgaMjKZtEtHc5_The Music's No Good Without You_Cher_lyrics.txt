Without you

The music's no good without you, baby
The music's no good at all
The music's no good without you, baby
Come back to me (Come back to me)
The music's no good without you, baby
The music's no good at all
The music's no good without you, baby
Come back to me (Come back to me)

Everyone was watching
You were the freakiest thing on show
Dazzle in the crystal ball
They all loved to watch it glow
You were the center of attention
The eye of the storm
A whirlwind from outer space
Like a twister on the scene

The music's no good without you, baby
The music's no good at all
The music's no good without you, baby
Come back to me (Come back to me)
The music's no good without you, baby
The music's no good at all
The music's no good without you, baby
Come back to me (Come back to me)
See Cher LiveGet tickets as low as $222You might also like
Mesmerize them when we danced
'Cause you sparkle next to me
We sit along the razor's edge
But you were crazy to be free
I agonize 'til you come back
And we'll dance that close again (I miss you)
I miss you, boy, I really do
Come back to me, come back to me

'Cause my world stopped spinning
Nothing I can do
So I pray that a DJ lifts my heart

The music's no good without you, baby
The music's no good at all
The music's no good without you, baby
Come back to me (Come back to me)
The music's no good without you, baby
(The music's no good without you)
The music's no good at all
The music's no good without you, baby
Come back to me (Come back to me)
The music's no good, the music's no good
The music's no good (Come back to me)
Come back
The music's no good
But I know you don't need me anymore (The music's no good)
And it's no good dwelling in the past (The music's no good)
I have to live each day (Come back)
Like it was my last
Without youEmbed
