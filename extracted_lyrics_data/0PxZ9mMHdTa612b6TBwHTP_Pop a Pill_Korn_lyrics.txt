Well, look at this!
I see clearly now
Look at this!
I can feel it now
Happiness!
Is seldom found
Pop the pill!
I'm so damn happy now

Feeling things crawl on me
I need my fix today
This is way beyond me
I can't live without you today

Well, look at this!
I see colors now
Look at this!
Im butt ugly now
Happiness!
Is seldom found
Pop the pill!
I'm so damn happy now

Feeling things crawl on me
I need my fix today
This is way beyond me
I can't live without you today
You today
You today

I don't care about anything around me
Even all the love that surrounds me
Beat me, eat me
I don't care about anything
I do this to shut off the voice
Within!
Within!
Within!
I don't care about anything

Feeling things crawl on me
I need my fix today
This is way beyond me
I can't live without you today
You today
You today
You today
Feeling things crawl on me
I need my fix today
This is way beyond me
I can't live without you today5Embed
