Many years ago when none could count the time
Spheres of light fell down, a rain of mystic fire from the skies
Thirsty angels smelled the warmth of life into this earth
Bathed with stardust, in greatness they descended

The Nephilim gods
The Nephilim gods
The Nephilim gods
The Nephilim gods

New resources formed the blood of their machines
Creatures and devices were the products of their will
To prevail in this world of virgin wilderness
They made some hands to carry their sacred tasks

Soon they felt an urge to taste the forbidden pleasures
Their flowers were erected for the daughters of their beasts

Soon they felt an urge to taste forbidden pleasures
Their flowers were erected for the daughters of their beasts
With awe and lust these young mutations drunk their potions
As bees they took their seed in places, far and wide
