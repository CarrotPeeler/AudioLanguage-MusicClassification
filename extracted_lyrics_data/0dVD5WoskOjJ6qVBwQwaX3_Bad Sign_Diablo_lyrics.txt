Grow upon the grain
Not far from here
It was the time when dreams

Now he is standing in silence
Holding his breath
Before they know it the blood runs red

Two
"For the shame"
Three and four
"Just in case"
No need for words
Eight will be a secret

He has frozen his fate
And now it's far too late
To find the reason to go on

One
"For the pain"
Two
"For the shame"
Three and four
"Just in case"
No need for words
Eight will be a
