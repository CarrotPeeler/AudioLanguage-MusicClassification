Come on closer
I wanna show you
What I'd like to do
You sit back now
Just relax now
I'll take care of you

Hot temptations
Sweet sensations
Infiltrating through
Sweet sensations
Hot temptations
Coming over you

Gonna take it slow babe
Do it my way
Keep your eyes on me
Your reaction
To my action
Is what I want to see

Rhythmic motion
Raw emotion
Infiltrating through
Sweet sensations
Hot temptations
Coming over you
You might also like
And now you're satisfied
A twinkle in your eye
Go to sleep for ten
And anticipating
I will be waiting
For you to wake again

Hot temptations
Sweet sensations
Infiltrating through
Sweet sensations
Hot temptations
Coming over you

When you wake up
We'll do it all again
When you wake up, up, up, up
When you wake up
We'll do it all again
When you wake up, up, up, up

Hour after hour of sweet pleasure, pleasure
After this I guarantee you'll never wanna leave
Shut your eyes and think about what I'm about to do
Sit back, relax, I'll take my time this loving's all for youEmbed
