4 ContributorsNowhere Girl Lyrics
Nowhere girl, you're living in a dream
Nowhere girl, you stay behind the scenes
Nowhere girl, you never go outside
Nowhere girl, cause you prefer to hide

Every day, every night
In that old familiar light
You hung up when I called you at home
And I try to get through
And I try to talk to you
But there's something stopping me from getting through

Nowhere girl, what you have you need
Nowhere girl, all functional and neat
Nowhere girl in self-imposed exile
Nowhere girl, a martyrlike denial

Every day, every night
In that old familiar light
You hung up when I called you at home
And I try to get through
And I try to talk to you
But there's something stopping me from getting throughYou might also likeEmbed
