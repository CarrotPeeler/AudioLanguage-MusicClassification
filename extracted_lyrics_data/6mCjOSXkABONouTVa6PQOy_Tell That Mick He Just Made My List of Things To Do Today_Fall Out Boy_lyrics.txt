Light that smoke, that one for giving up on me
And one just 'cause they'll kill you sooner than my expectations
To my favorite liar, to my favorite scar (to my favorite scar!)
I could have died with you
I hope you choke on those words that kiss that bottle
Confess (so bury me in memory)
Now ask yourself, yeah, out of the insides
Said I loved you but I lied

Let's play this game, called "when you catch fire
I wouldn't piss to put you out"
Stop burning bridges and drive off of them
So I can forget about you

So bury me in memory, his smile's your rope
So wrap it tight around your throat

On the drive home, joke about the kid you used to see
And his jealousy
Breaking hearts has never looked so cool
As when you wrap your car around a tree
Your makeup looks so great next to his teeth (His teeth!)

Let's play this game, called "when you catch fire
I wouldn't piss to put you out", no
Stop burning bridges and drive off of them
So I can forget about you

So bury me in memory, his smile's your rope
So wrap it tight around your throat
So bury me in memory, his smile's your rope
So wrap it tight around your throat


So bury me in memory around your throat10Embed
