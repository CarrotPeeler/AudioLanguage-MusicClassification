2 ContributorsI Swallowed A Dragonfly LyricsOh, I want to go
To a place we've never been
Been down for a while
We're comin' up to the surface
I swallowed a dragonfly
In the hopes that it would help me fly
And it did for just one day
And that day I saw everything
And I keep on, on movin' forward
Even when I'm down
And I keep on movin' forward
All the time
Yeah I keep on movin' forward
All the time
I keep on movin' forward
Even when I'm down
And I don't know
Don't know what it is
That keeps me downYou might also likeEmbed
