1 ContributorRemnants Of Percy Bass LyricsHe scrapes the dirt from his nails with a stick
He makes a big pile in a pail on the sink
Who was he?
Oh, I'll never tell
He has not got a thing left to sell
Ooh, the remnants of Percy Bass
He glued the newspaper to the wall
Skeleton closets are down the hall
Nobody knows him like I do
I remember when there were
I remember when there were things he could do
Some things are not made to last
Ooh, the remnants of Percy Bass
Some things are things like this:
He could catch a rabbit with one hand
He could build a castle out of sand. He was
A handsome man
He gave a tender kiss
Nobody knows about the fancy shows you starred in
When you were seventeen
I'll never tell about your secret life
To a magazine
You might also likeI can remember when you were the shallow hero
It was so long ago when you were
Everybody's shining star
You were a daydream
But now
He needs someone to hold his hand
Nothing has quite worked out how he had planned
I try to help him how I can
But he has forgotten
He has forgotten who I am
Remember
Some things are not made to last
Ooo, the remnants of Percy Bass
Some things are not made to last
Ooo, the remnants of Percy BassEmbed
