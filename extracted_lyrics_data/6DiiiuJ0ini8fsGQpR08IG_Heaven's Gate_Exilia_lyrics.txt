1 ContributorHeavenâ€™s Gate LyricsI'm not awake
I'm sleeping in my head
I'm so far away
I cannot hear you anymore
I'm running through the fields
Never running out of breath
I feel the grain beneath my hands
I'm whispering to the wind
If I had wings I would try to fly
If I had wings I would try to fly
If I had wings I would try to fly
Where the angels lie
Where the love will never die
Where I'll see you again
And the light will always shine
Where the storm is gone
Where the dawn will kiss the sun
Where we'll meet again
I'm looking right through heaven's gate
I'm peaceful now
Locked in my immagination
Following the path
To the edge of what is real

If I had wings I would try to fly
If I had wings I would try to fly
If I had wings I would try to fly
Where the angels lie
Where the love will never die
Where I'll see you again
And the light will always shine
Where the storm is gone
Where the dawn will kiss the sun
Where we'll meet again
I'm looking right through heaven's gate
If I had wings I would try to fly
If I had wings I would try to fly
If I had wings I would try to fly
If I had wings I would try to fly
If I had wings I would try to fly
If I had wings I would try to fly
Try to fly
Where the angels lie
Where the love will never die
Where I'll see you again
And the light will always shine
Where the storm is gone
Where the dawn will kiss the sun
Where we'll meet again
I'm looking right through heaven's gateEmbed
