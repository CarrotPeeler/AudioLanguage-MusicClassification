5 ContributorsAsylum Lyrics
Guess who's back?
Welcome to Asylum...

Hollowtips leave a nigga leakin' on the floor (That's what he get!)
That's what he get for even speaking to a carnivore
I stay ready for battle, there's no beefin' with the Lord of War
Blood flows at a moment's notice, Lord knows that I'm one of the coldest
Soulless, so it's upon us that I'm still livin'
They never wanted me to make it
Surrounded by hell and hatred
Was drowning, but I escaped, they still ain't made it off the block
I ain't never take no shots, but I done gave out a few
For speakin' down upon my name, I blow the brain out a fool
'Cause Hoodoo carry guns too (Don't get it fucked up!)
They'll never find you, must I remind you
That-that I'm from the murder mitten, guns who never heard of spittin'
Rippin' off your legs
A couple extra shots to knock your homie out his J's (Out his J's)
I'm from where they prey on the weak
P-put the key to your cheek
S-spray your smile all over the street
In real time, poison your mind
My rhymes are like the antidote
The mental blockage from all that garbage that you've been hearin'
That's interferin' with that real ill, I am the real deal
Baptised in the wicked ways, dark side I play wicked games
New terror, on your head like a new error
Hard as nails from the gate, my fate was written in stone on two tablets
True savage, snatched his soul without leavin' a scar
Who we are is not to be questioned
I'm destined to die like Jimi Hendrix overdosin' on the music, I'm gone
From acid binges, my revenge is resurrection
Domination over my section, killin' the game, y'all gon' need protection
Makin' my lane, don't change my direction
Reppin' hard for my block (7 Mile!)
To your hood, so nigga tell me what you know, good
I'm looking for some bad bitches and somethin' that blow good
Holler if you feel me, fuck these haters tryin' to kill me
Psychopathic 'til I'm laid in a casket or straitjacket

Yeah!
Arms wrapped around my chest in a vest to keep me from wilin'
Stay locked up in a padded room 'cause they fear what's inside 'em for years
They try to fight it, but they can no longer hide it
I'm psychopathic, there's no denyin'
So they had to put me straight in the asylum
Arms wrapped around my chest in a vest to keep me from wilin'
Stay locked up in a padded room 'cause they fear what's inside 'em for years
They try to fight it, but they can no longer hide it
I'm psychopathic, there's no denyin'
So they had to put me straight in the asylum

They call me Embed
