1 ContributorWhy So Simple? Lyrics(Verse 1)
I find myself through a bottle and amphetamines/
Zoned out, closed up, anticipating weathering/
Son, it's Stephen, can we speak about redemption?/
I'm on pins and needles, frozen in suspension/
Backyard, Victoria, working on a cigar/
Pen in my hand, man, devising up my next bar/
Out and about, they asking 'bout my head scar/
Others, bout my music, ask if I'm the next star/
D's in the basement, mixing up the medicine/
I'm on a stage, loud, bitching like a reverend/
'Till the next club, politicking like a candidate/
Bandit's in the back room, playin' with a mandolin/
Plotting out the next move, area we canvasing/
Tryin' for some net worth, scheming on the back end/
Take turns on the soapbox, speakin' on our hate of/
The puppets on the radio and how they try and play us.../
(Hook)
Why so simple?! Why so simple?!
Oh...Oh!
Why so fickle?! Why so fickle?!
Why so simple?! Why so simple?!
Oh...oh!
Why so fickle?! Why so fickle?!

/It’s a cold world, so you better bundle up/
No socks, no shoes, no Daddy Warbucks/
Took shit promised to the center of the heart/
Being told the game’s over before I start/
That shit hit you like bricks if you ain’t ready/
I want to make it rain, surprise, no confetti/
I’m racing for the money like my name is Andretti/
And my lines stay heavy, smooth like I’m riding Chevy/
Hands stay steady, right on track, never leftie/
The rest are going backwards like Go!, set, ready/
Just really know how hard I want to /
And I’ll do anything besides sell my soul /
And I can put it on life, you count on /
Like I put on for Hip Hop, instead of rap/
And I guess that’s why all the others are wack/
I’m fact, they fiction as a matter a fact/
*Repeat Hook*
(Verse 3)
/Now...Look at the doggy in the window/
/Another cute mutt that's impeding on your kinfolk/
/Singing along to hoes and endo/
/Wonderin' why in the hell should I sit for?/
/I said "Shit, ask Rosa"/ Or any other pioneer or dope composer/
They say "Naw Son, spark that doulja"/
"Write another joint that ride for me and my soldiers"/
I respond with "Read a book son, find some composure"/
"Learn about culture and looking for closure"/
Told me I'm a a square, "We can't bop to this"/
"Man, shorty won't rock or gimme wop to this"/
"My box in the back won't knock to this"/
"Man Crock, no offense, but this a crock of shit"/
I said "Son there's more than being on the block with chips"/
They say you piss in the wind, but can't stop the rich/Embed
