In this world as we know it
Sorrows come and go
Now we see the human race
Has put it's footprints on the moon's face

Satellite's gone up to the sky
But it's not as nice as looking in your eyes
Woh, take it for a while
No, I could watch it on tv, yeah

Satellite of love
Oh, satellite of love
Satellite of love
Satellite of

Satellite's gone up to the sky
And it's going to drive me out of my mind
Woh, take it for a little while
No, I can watch it on tv, yeah

Satellite of love
Satellite of love
Satellite of love
Satellite of

I've been told, baby, you've been bold
To Winkin', Blinkin' and Nod
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday
To Winkin', Blinkin' and Nod

Satellite of love
Satellite of love
Satellite of love
Satellite of

Satellite of love
Satellite of love
It's just a little bit of a satellite of loveEmbed
