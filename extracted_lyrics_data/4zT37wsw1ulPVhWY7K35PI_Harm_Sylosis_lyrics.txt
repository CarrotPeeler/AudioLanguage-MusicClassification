3 ContributorsHarm LyricsEndure the paths unaligned
Idle hands create idols and shrines
The devil makes use of those who squander their time
Keep your enemies close
Surrounded by sinners and ghosts
Eyes to the ground
Whispers arise from the heart of the hive
The heart of darkness
Bleeds only for one and for one it serves
It burns black coal
Through veins, the flesh, the bone
By raising your voice
You will invite death
Stay close to the swarm
And you will come to no harm
By raising your voice
You will give us away
Stay close to the swarm
And you will come to no harm
Forgotten yet ostracized
Moving beneath the darkest of skies
Riding the mist concealed
Hidden in plain sight
You might also likeKeep your enemies close
Surrounded by sinners and ghosts
Eyes to the ground
Whispers arise from the heart of the hive
The heart of darkness
Bleeds only for one and for one it serves
It burns black coal
Through veins, the flesh, the bone
By raising your voice
You will invite death
Stay close to the swarm
And you will come to no harm
By raising your voice
You will give us away
Stay close to the swarm
And you will come to no harm
Deafened by the sirens and wounded souls
Bound down! They hear the voices
They will drown out all remnants of us
Bound down! They hear the voices
They will drown out, forever servants
How can you feel safe out here

By raising your voice
You will invite death
Stay close to the swarm
And you will come to no harm
By raising your voice
You will give us away
Stay close to the swarm
And you will come to no harmEmbed
