Casey Jones was a brave engineer. When the road wast wiped his wife did want him to go. He was sittin' up in his cab the day he made the way. She felt that something might go wrong she called him something like this:

Casey, don't leave me here
Casey, don't, please don't leave me here

Little children come to their father crying: daddy don't leave us here...

Daddy, daddy, don't leave us here

He couldn't stand that children crying he told the farmer he said get the bell going I heard the bell going something like this...
Wife still crying...

Don't leave me here, Casey
Don't, please don't leave me here

Next thing I heard his drive wheel jumping in the railroad joints something like this he were gone...
He run up some sheep, some sheep he couldn't flag them so he had to stop his train, made him sort of mad, too. I heard him, when he was cuttin' down, he was blowing something like this for the sheep to get off the track... After he had to stop for the sheep to get off the track come his cousin here is what he said you know, what he said was this:

Hop down little sheep, hop down little sheep
Don't leave me here Casey, don't, don't leave me here
