1 ContributorHer Song (TRIGGER 10d mix) LyricsShy
But painfully aware
She cries
No feeling in the air
Left
With nothing but a glance
Wish
For better circumstance
This is for her
So that she understands
Someone cares
This is for her
To let it all go
Be happy again
Cold
Lonely thoughts arise
Knows
Where the demons hide
She
Wants to be ok
No
Longer be afraid
This is for her
Fly away with me
Let her be free
This is for her
To let it all go
Be happy again

This is for her
This is for herEmbed
