3 ContributorsHeatstrokes LyricsI know you call me
A dirty lover
But that's exactly
What you need
It's not the talkin'
Not even the jokin'
It's bedtime action
Baby til you plead
Heatstrokes fire burnin' smoke ooh yeah
Heatstrokes fire burnin' smoke
I've got to do it
Twice or more tonight
Ooh baby I need you
Your pants are so tight
Chorus
Let's get some shelter
I need it fast and hot
So take your umbrella
And we can do it on the spot
Chorus
