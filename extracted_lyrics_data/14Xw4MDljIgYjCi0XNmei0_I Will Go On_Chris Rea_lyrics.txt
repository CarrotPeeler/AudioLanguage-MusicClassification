1 ContributorI Will Go On LyricsI got a cold grey morning
Waiting for me
I look out my window
Should don’t like what i see
Seems like the devil himself
Is singing my song
I pick myself up
And i will go on
.... in the wind and rain
Seems like the devil himself
Is callin’ my name
But i can’t never give up
No matter how long
So i pick myself up
And i will go on
Pick myself up
And i will go on
... on the mountain
There’s a wild storm at sea
Thou than i think of your sweet love
That means nothing to me
So i will never give up
No matter how long
I pick myself up
And i will go on
Pick myself up, yeah
And i will go onYou might also likeEmbed
