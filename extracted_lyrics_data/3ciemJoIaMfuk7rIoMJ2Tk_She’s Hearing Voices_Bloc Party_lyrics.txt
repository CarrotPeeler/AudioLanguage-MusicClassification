Hey, hey, hey, hey
She's hearing voices call her
She's hearing voices warn her
She just can't sleep in her bed
She just can't sleep
She's falling down the stairs
She's tearing out her hair
She's screaming my name in the night
To keep her warm

She got a red pill, blue pill
Red pill, blue pill
Red pill, blue pill
Red pill, blue pill
Red pill, blue pill
Red pill, blue pill
Red pill, blue pill
Milk of amnesia

Hey, hey, hey, hey
Oh, come on and I know that you want it
Was it nothing, nothing to shout about?
Jump, jump right in

She got a red pill, blue pill
Red pill blue pill
Red pill blue pill
Red pill blue pill
Red pill blue pill
Red pill blue pill
Red pill blue pill
Red pill blue pill
She got a red pill, blue pill
Red pill, blue pill
Red pill, blue pill
Red pill, blue pill
Red pill, blue pill
Red pill, blue pill
Red pill, blue pill
Milk of amnesia

She's scared of the blacks and she's scared of the Jews
She is walking around, she is yesterday's news
And she cries out my name in the dead of the night
She is sleeping in our room, she is crying on her side
Walking on eggshells, I'm walking on glass
I'm burnt by the mirror, I'm burnt by the light
Feeling rejection, I'll burn down your house
Tearing down posters, I was never aliveEmbed
