1 ContributorOne Room Country Shack LyricsA thousand miles from nowhere, one room country shack
I'm a thousand miles from nowhere, one room lil' country shack
No one to talk to, and no one to keep me company
All day long, I drag an eleven-foot cotton sack
All day long, I drag an eleven-foot cotton sack
I drug'd it so long, you know it done made my shoulder sore
Have mercy
No one to talk to me at night, the frogs and triggers callin' round my door, hahahah
No one to talk to me at night, the frogs and triggers howlin' round my door
I got to find me a companionship, before I go out of my mind
Out a cloud
A-hey! Oh! Hey-u!
Looky here now, I gotta find me a companionship, I don't care whether she's deaf, dumb or blind
I gotta find me a companionship, people, I don't care whether she's deaf, dumb and blind
I gotta find me somebody, before I go out'a my mind
A thousand miles from nowhere, in the one room lil' country shack
A thousand miles from nowhere, in a one room country shack
I'm tired of being alone
One room, one room
