2 ContributorsUp A Tree Again LyricsI'll get up high
Above the lanes
Look at me up a tree again
I brought a knife
To carve our names
Look at me
I'm up a tree again
Look at me up a tree again
The leaves are falling
The leaves are falling
Look at me up a tree again
The leaves are falling
The leaves are falling
And as they fall
You'll hear me I'll call:
Look at me up a tree again
Look at me up a tree again
Look at me here I'm up a tree again
I broke a blade
I used some crayons
(Look at me up a tree again)
To draw a heart
Around our names
Look at me up a tree again
And as they fall
You'll hear me I'll call:
Look at me up a tree again
Look at me up a tree again...
Leaves are falling...You might also likeEmbed
