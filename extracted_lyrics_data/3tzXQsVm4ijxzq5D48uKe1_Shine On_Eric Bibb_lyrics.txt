1 ContributorShine On LyricsMm hmmm
Oh yeah
Life gives you the runaround, you say
You wanna know
How much dues must you pay
Well, you can pay off what you want to
When there's a will
There's always a way
Keeping your eyes on
That mountain top
Stepping up time
Don't ever, ever stop
Keep on when your mind says "Quit"
Dream on 'til you find your living it
I'll be right by your side
Yeah baby, keep on
Don't stop 'til you win your prize
Lean on all the love that is in my eyes
You're a diamond to me, yes you are
Shine on
Shine on

I see
But it's time to leave it behind and let it be
Yeah
Hard-earned wisdom is something you can't buy
It's the wings of experience
That make you fly
Don't look back
Don't look back
Don't turn around
You're on the right track
Keep on when your mind says "Quit"
Dream on 'til you find your living it
I'll be right by your side
Yeah baby, keep on
Don't stop 'til you win your prize
Lean on all the love that is in my eyes
You're a diamond to me, yes you are
Shine on
Shine on
Shine on
Keep on when your mind says "Quit"
Dream on 'til you find your living it
I'll be right by your side
Yeah baby baby
Don't stop 'til you win your prize
Lean on all the love that's in my eyes
You're a diamond to me, yes you are
Shine on
Shine on
Baby, you got to shine on
That's what you're born to do
Me and you
You got to shine on
Sparkle baby
Shine on
Baby you got to
Shine onEmbed
