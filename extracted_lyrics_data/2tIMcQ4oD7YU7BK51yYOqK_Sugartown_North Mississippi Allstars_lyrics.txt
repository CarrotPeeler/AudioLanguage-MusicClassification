1 ContributorSugartown LyricsHere I am in Sugartown
Up on Sugarhill
Gonna shake the sugar down
Cause my sugar-mama will
Shake it baby, shake it baby, shake it baby, alright
Shake it baby, shake it baby, shake it baby, all night
Po' boy in Sugarland
Cuttin' down the sugarcane
If you see me runnin', gonna be a free man
Shake it baby, shake it baby, shake it baby, alright
Shake it baby, shake it baby, shake it baby, all night
Went to a sugartree
Shook it with all my might
Said "what's the matter, honey?"
You ain't shakin' right
Shake it baby, shake it baby, shake it baby, alright
Shake it baby, shake it baby, shake it baby, all night
On down to Sugartown
