3 ContributorsGot the Feelinâ€™ (Radio Edit) Lyrics
Na, na, na, na, na, na

Uh, here we go again with the beats
We got your heads bumping, now you're jumping from your seats
If this is what you're wanting over there, throw your hands up in the air because you know we bring the sounds so unique
Now everybody's moving, everybody's grooving
Getting down with Five when we come your way
Move it to the left, now you shake it to the right
Because you know we gotta keep this party pumping through the night
Check me out now

Ayo, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one
I'm on the microphone, got you hot like the sun
So a one, two, three, now I'm waiting on the four
Kick down the door and turn it up a little more
You might also like
If you got the feelin', jump up to the ceiling, ah, we're getting down tonight
One if you're gonna, two if you wanna, three 'cause everything's alright
If you got the feelin', less of the dreaming, ah, we're getting down tonight
It's just 'round the corner, tell me if you wanna, Five will make you feel alright

Ah, move it at the back to the track
We got it going on, we're the leaders of the pack
Now if you feel alright, hold it tight
See, we wanna carry on 'cause we're gonna take it through until the dawn
Now everybody's moving, everybody's grooving
Getting down with Five when we come your way
So raise up your arms if we drop it on the one
You see we're gonna carry on because the fun has just begun
Check us out now

Ayo, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one
I'm on the microphone, got you hot like the sun
So a one, two, three, now I'm waiting on the four
Kick down the door and turn it up a little more

If you got the feelin', jump up to the ceiling, ah, we're getting down tonight
One if you're gonna, two if you wanna, three 'cause everything's alright
If you got the feelin', less of the dreaming, ah, we're getting down tonight
It's just 'round the corner, tell me if you wanna, Five will make you feel alright
Oh
Na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na

If you got the feelin', jump up to the ceiling, ah, we're getting down tonight
One if you're gonna, two if you wanna, three 'cause everything's alright
If you got the feelin', less of the dreaming, ah, we're getting down tonight
It's just 'round the corner, tell me if you wanna, Five will make you feel alright (Woo)
If you got the feelin', jump up to the ceiling, ah, we're getting down tonight
One if you're gonna, two if you wanna, three 'cause everything's alright
If you got the feelin', less of the dreaming, ah, we're getting down tonight
