I won't fucking die
Yeah, that's right
These uncontrollable thoughts
They stem from you
These undeniable shocks
They stem from you
This undeniable sleeplessness
It stems from you
This undeniable weakness
It stems from you
We're just falling off the deep end
Dying, screaming
In this hole that you fill
Die, die, die, I won't die for
Screaming, slowly
Die, die, die, I won't die for you, you
For you, (these un-???)
These wandering eyes
Watch after you
These paranoid lies
Run after you
This undeniable sleeplessness
It stems from you
This undeniable weakness
It stems from you

Dying, screaming
In this hole that you fill
Die, die, die, I won't die for
Screaming, slowly
Die, die, die, I won't die for you, you, you, you
Every day
Every fucking minute
I think
I've lost myself in you
I've betrayed myself for you, for you
You, yeah, you mark me the deepest
You, yeah, you scar me the deepest
You, yeah, hurt me the deepest
You mark me the deepest
I'm falling off the deep end
Dying, screaming
In this hole that you fill
Die, die, die, I won't die for
Screaming, slowly
Die, die, die, I won't die for (x3)
Die, die, die, won't fucking die for you, you, you, fuck youEmbed
