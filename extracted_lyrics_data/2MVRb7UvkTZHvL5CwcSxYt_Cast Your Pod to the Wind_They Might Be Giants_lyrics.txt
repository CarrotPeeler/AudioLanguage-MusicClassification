2 ContributorsCast Your Pod to the Wind LyricsTwirl, twirl, twirl, spin
Extend your limbs, spin
Spin, ever faster
Cast your pod to the wind
Round, round, round
Feel the breeze, it's
Free, free, relax
Your grip and
Cast your pod to the wind
Disregard the expense and
Disengage from the sense
And liberate your pod and let it go
Fly, fly, fly, let
The pod become a speck
In the sky and
Cast your pod to the windSee They Might Be Giants LiveGet tickets as low as $53You might also likeEmbed
