3 ContributorsFuel to the flame LyricsWhen I met you
I said we'd hang out everyday
Now I upset you
Right from the payphones on Queens West and Bay
She's saying:
The words I'm saying have lost their meaning
When I'm so far from my aim
But trying to tell me I'm only dreaming
Is like adding fuel to the flame
Is like adding fuel to the flame
Is like adding fuel to the flame
When I told you
I'd buy a brand new car, first rate
That was a lie to you
I got a Civic from '88
She's saying:
The words I'm saying have lost their meaning
When I'm so far from my aim
But trying to tell me I'm only dreaming
Is like adding fuel to the flame
Is like adding fuel to the flame
Is like adding fuel to the flame

I think we make a really good team
I think we make a real good team, yes we do
I think it's cause I love you
That I've been living a dream
And it's you who are that dream
And you've already come true
She's saying:
The words I'm saying have lost their meaning
When I'm so far from my aim
But trying to tell me I'm only dreaming
Is like adding fuel to the flame
Is like adding fuel to the flame
Is like adding fuel to the flame
Is like adding fuel to the flame
Saying I'm dreaming is like adding fuel to the flameEmbed
