8 ContributorsLifetime Lyrics
I can't let nothing come in between the two of us
'Cause it's like you're all I need since we've been together
And, whenever I'm in need of a little love
It's okay for me to open up
But I just can't give my heart to anyone, girl

Some only come in your life for a season
And stay a while, giving you a reason
To take temporary and think that it's forever
But you've given me someone that I can believe in
I know that there will be times we can't come to an agreement
But I know we'll figure out the ups and downs
Tell me, are you willing to take a chance?
Baby, if so...

(Here we go, here we go)
Let me put you in my hands
(Come on, come on)
I wanna be your man
Let's do it right so that you'll be with me a lifetime
('Cause you know and I know)
Don't think that I'm talking crazy
(Come on)
Your mama and my mama want some grand-babies tonight
Would you be with me a lifetime?

I used to think it was hopeless and I should just give it up (give it up)
But I couldn't stop until I found myself a good girl (to be in love)
I checked every state and city and looked all around the world
And I'm proud to say that my search ends here
'Cause you're one in a million to me
And I can't let you go, baby

Some only come in your life for a season
And stay a while, giving you a reason
To take temporary and think that it's forever
And you've given me someone that I can believe in
I know that there will be times we can't come to an agreement
But I know we'll figure out the ups and downs
Tell me, are you willing to take a chance?
Baby, if so...

(Here we go, here we go)
Let me put you in my hands
(Come on, come on)
I wanna be your man
Let's do it right so that you'll be with me a lifetime
('Cause you know and I know)
You know I ain't talking crazy
(Come on)
Your mama and my mama want some grand-babies tonight
Would you be with me a lifetime?
Listen, seasons are truly meant to chance
However, love can be the reason you fall
But when you find that special someone
You'll be willing to give them a lifetime
I love you and I choose you
Follow me

Some only come in your life for a season
And stay a while, giving you a reason
To take temporary and think that it's forever
And you've given me someone that I can believe in
I know that there will be times we can't come to an agreement
But I know we'll figure out the ups and downs
Tell me, are you willing to take a chance?
Baby, if so...

(Here we go, here we go)
Let me put you in my hands
(Come on, come on)
I wanna be your man
Let's do it right so that you'll be with me a lifetime
('Cause you know and I know)
You know I ain't talking crazy
(Come on)
Your mama and my mama want some grand-babies...3Embed
