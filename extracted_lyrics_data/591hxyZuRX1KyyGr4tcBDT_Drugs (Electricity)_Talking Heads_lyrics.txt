3 ContributorsElectricity - Drugs Remastered & Expanded Version LyricsAnd all I see is little dots
Some are smeared, some are spots
Feel like murder but that's alright
Somebody said there's too much light
Pull down that shade and it's alright
It'll be over in a minute or two
I'm charged up, don't put me down
Don't feel like talking, don't mess around
I feel mean, but I feel okay
I'm charged up, electricity
Is that what you calling
The boys are making a big mess
This makes the girls all start to laugh
I don't know what they're talking about
The boys are worried, the girls are shocked
They pick the sound and let it drop
Nobody knows what they're talking about
I'm charged up, with frightful ways
Don't tell the truth, I just tell lies
I'm picking up, but I left off
I'm charged up, it's pretty intense
I'm charged up, don't put me down
Don't feel like talking, don't mess around
And I feel mean, I feel okay
I'm charged up, electricity
That's right, calling my nameYou might also likeEmbed
