Someday
Someday

Precious stone, life goes on
You have abused and used me
Now I'm going home
I want my records back
To get my heart on track
You think I can't be alone
Well, this woman's here to show you, oh

Someday the lights will fall and you will know
If you do it slowly
You might just find it's worth it all

Precious stone, life goes on
You feel used and abused
Now you're all alone
How dare you say
I will be back one day?
You've taken me for granted
It's time for me to say

Someday the lights will fall and you will know
If you do it slowly
You might just find it's worth it all

Someday, he'll be there to hold you, baby
There by the grace a sign
Someday, he'll be there to dry your tears
Someday, he'll be there to hold you, baby
There by the grace a sign
Someday, he'll be there to dry your tears
Precious stone, life goes on
Precious stone, you will...

I want my records back
To get my heart on track
You think I can't be alone
Well, this woman's here to show you, oh
How dare you say
I will be back one day?
You've taken me for granted
You need to find your way

Someday the lights will fall and you will know
(Get back one day)
If you do it slowly
You might just find it's worth it all
Someday
If you do it slowly
You might just find it's worth it allEmbed
