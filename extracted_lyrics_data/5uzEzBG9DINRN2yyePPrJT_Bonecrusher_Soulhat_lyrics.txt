1 ContributorBonecrusher LyricsThis is a song, for my mother
And the boy she raised
Well I’m the mighty Bonecrusher and I live way out west
I’m a gambling man by nature but bonecrushin’s what I do best
Yea well I’m the mighty Bonecrusher and I’ll crush your bones for a buck
I got a Ph.D. in knife fighting and saying fuck, yeah
That’s what I’m sayin’, with the Bonecrusher all day
That’s what I’m sayin’
Big bad Bonecrusher, stand eleven foot tall
Line you perverts up like cans and watch me crush ya all
Well I say whatever I want to, don’t pay attention to grammar
Got a big long middle finger, shaped just like a ball-peen hammer
That’s what I’m sayin’, with the Bonecrusher all day
That’s what I’m sayin’
Say Bonecrusher, please don’t crush my bones [?}
Askin’ nicely won’t help you don’t you know? 
Say Bonecrusher, please don’t crush my bones 
You know I lost my hearing so long ago…
Now that I’ve grown, gonna crush everything I see
Even the little, small flowers

Well I’m the mighty Bonecrusher, I crushed NYC
Wasn’t nearly half as bad as they make it look like on TV
I jumped down from the Empire State, landed on my head
Got up and did a little funky dance, just to prove that I wasn’t dead yet
That’s what I’m sayin’, with the Bonecrusher all day
That’s what I’m sayin’
Say Bonecrusher, please don’t crush my bones
Askin’ nicely won’t help you don’t you know?
Say Bonecrusher, please don’t crush my bones
You know I lost my hearing so long ago…
So long ago, So long ago, So long ago… Embed
