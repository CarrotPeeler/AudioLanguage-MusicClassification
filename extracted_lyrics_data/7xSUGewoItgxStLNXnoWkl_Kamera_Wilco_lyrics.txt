I need a camera to my eye
To my eye, remindin'
Which lies have I been hidin'
Which echoes belong

I've counted out
The days to see how far
I've driven in the dark
With echoes in my heart

Phone my family
Tell 'em I'm lost on the sidewalk
And no, it's not okay

I smashed a camera
I wanna know why
To my eye, decidin'
Which lies have I been hidin'
Which echoes belong

I'm counting on
A heart I know by heart
To walk me through this war
Where memories distort

Phone my family
Tell 'em I'm lost on the sidewalk
And no, it's not okay

I've counted out
And no one knows how far
(Tell 'em I'm lost)
I've driven in the dark
(Tell 'em I'm lost)
With echoes in my heart
(Tell 'em I'm lost)

Phone my family
Tell 'em I'm lost
Yeah, I'm lost
And no, it's not okay

No, it's not okay
No, it's not okay3Embed
