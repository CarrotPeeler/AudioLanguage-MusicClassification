2 ContributorsThe Way She Moves LyricsSee her coming down the catwalk
She all silk and high heel shoes
She dressed to kill anybody
This darling, she can't lose
She's a diamond in the night
She kick away those ageing blues
But it ain't what she's wearing
It's in the way she moves
She got a big red rooster tail
She got him crying like a child
He's got to have this angel
Oh she's gonna drive him wild
She got a see-true silk kimono
Oh I swear she's gonna blow some fuse
But it ain't what she's wearing
It's in the way she moves
She got a face to spin your head around
She got a smile you can't refuse
She got eyes that knock you over
This darling she can't lose
She got a see-true kimono
Or I swear she's gonna blow some fuse
But it ain't what she's wearing
It's the way she movesYou might also likeEmbed
