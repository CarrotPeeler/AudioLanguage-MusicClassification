1 Contributor5GLTE / NEON LyricsTalk
Couldn’t have said it better myself
(Gonna) better myself
Talk
I scroll feeds of dope memes that joke fiends perpetrate
I know things aren’t what seems but no things are perfect, aye
I know you put it in but she’s telling you to insert the game
Too small? don’t worry, she will get that you are nervous, babe
Do my words make you nervous?
Do the word come from churches?
They find better in your purses
It all ends up for the purchase
Urgency in your notifications
Splurge after seeking the proper provocations
Encourage just a week of vacation
But don’t see the vacation
In a hard days work in summation
Then two days rest for the nation
To build muscle, 8 hours sleep, assimilation
Of their mind, body, family and soul with compensation
Health and dedication
It will make for the greatness
And I say this in spite of erudites who hate this
A young dispossessed person steering the conversations
You might also likeI’m 5G LTE with the bars
Faking like a sim we gonna pull your card
When you faking baby we can tell you faking real hard
Save it for the basics, we out here on our guard
5G LTE with the bars
Faking like a sim we gonna pull your card
Don’t be faking like a bitch like you withholding the bars
And then let us see you on Dancing with the Stars
Dropped calls, drop-offs, drop your balls and pick up
The game that needs to be played don’t raise a stick up
No selfie-sticks, no selfish pricks, your socials ain’t a fix up
For your shitty social life spent staring at pictures
Reading into texts and subtweets like it’s scripture
Falling out over nothing like Joe Biden’s dentures
Dora the internet explora on adventures
Cruising the safari, investigating the mentions
Too busy being invested to make inventions
Used to be working out of garages, now we working out depression
Black Mirrors what new Narcissists content with
Call drops, I block you like football does with xenith
Somebody’s opinion ought not be your only thought isn’t it
When you feeble drop bitches realize the needle drop critic
Ain’t the only one, don’t be beholdent, son
About to shit yourself and yet you holding Tums
You going dumb, comfy numb
Comfortable with the function
Comfortable with the fuckshit
Short attention spans and reluctance
It’s not me you wanna fuck with
It’s the brains of all these youngsters
We need a way back into the substance
We want friends and family in abundance
But only on internet follows and functions
For real
Some of us alone, throwing cash as them buns dance
We working away a generation that could be way more fun, damn
I thought we’d be better off with all this power in our hands
Keep on like we ain’t our bygones in the future
Neon lights, peon bites on the ramen noodles
Freon white, xenon highs in the commons zooted
Sleep, they lying on me, kamasutra
Blade running the streets, fuck with me, I’ll have to shoot ya
Laser gun in my cleets, you need a hospital suture
In three, two, one it’s 3D onto screens, so suit up
I’m releasing your misery once my PC screen boots up
Youtube and Dailymotion, Redtube you get the lotion
You a noob, a baby, don’t know the debt of your devotion
You gross, no, you don’t net enough for the potion
The elixir of sewing the net to catch the whole ocean
Aw shit, reel it in, throw it back and hope it’s
Profit motive incentives causing erosion
Drop it, auf Wiedersehen, on my back is the hopeless
Put a sock in it, speak of them and your back getting broken
You can’t carry all of that weight so break it down
All that blue light with you ain’t a good way to go out
YeahEmbed
