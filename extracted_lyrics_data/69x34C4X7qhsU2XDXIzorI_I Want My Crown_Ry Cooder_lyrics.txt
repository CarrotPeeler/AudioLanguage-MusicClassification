1 ContributorI Want My Crown Lyrics
In the dark of night the secret vote was cast
We drove the union down at last
My evil deeds have ruined the land
A house divided it cannot stand

And I want my crown, well I want my crown
The working man has been cast down
And I want my crown

And then the day dawned bright and hard
When I stole away the court of nine
The Judas men served the cause
And the sacred church of law is mine

I want my crown, yes and I want my crown
Justice has been cast down
I want my crown, I want my crown

You love the gleaming war machine
Your hearts beat fast, your eyes on the prize
War without end, riches untold
Oil and God and your righteous pride
You might also like
(I want my crown) I want my crown
(I want my crown) Yes I want my crown
Peace on earth has been cast down
(I want my crown)
I want my crown

I'm going to sit here and watch
Your little world come tumbling down
(I want my crown) I want my crown
Yes, I want my crown, I want my crown
I want my crown, I want my crown
I want my crown, I want my crownEmbed
