I'll get by somehow
Just right now
All I can do is cry
All I can do is cry
I tried to find
Why you said go
Now I know
All I can do is cry
All I can do is cry
Tell me why
You walked out that way
What can I say
All I can do is cry
All I can do is cry
I keep searching for an answer
As I sit here in my lonely room
Till I find a reason to keep living
All I can do is cry
All I can do is cry
All I can do is cry....Yeah
I keep searching for an answer
As I sit here in my lonely room
Till I find an reason to keep living
All I can do is cry
All I can do is cry
All I can do is cry
You've gone away
I'll get by somehow
Just right now
All I can do is cry
All I can do is cry
I tried to find
Why you said go
Now I know
All I can do is cry
All I can do is cry
All I can do is cryYou might also likeEmbed
