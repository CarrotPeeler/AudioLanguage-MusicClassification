It's no so often I make love with a porcupine
On the floor you scratched and clawed
If I'm a safe, you cracked my door
I kissed the spikey fridge
That's the way she is
I kissed the spikey fridge
That's the way she is
You spread a frost to starch my fears
I'll wipe away your crocodile tears
I kissed the spikey fridge
That's the way she is
I kissed the spikey fridge
That's the way she is
I kissed the spikey fridge
That's the way she is
I kissed the spikey fridge
That's the way she is
You might also likeI dream of you
You know you've pricked me for a hundred years
Shivers on my spine
Love sends a loving sign
That I want you
That I need you
Hold me harder
Suck my love in
I kissed the spikey fridge
That's the way she is
I kissed the spikey fridge
That's the way she is
