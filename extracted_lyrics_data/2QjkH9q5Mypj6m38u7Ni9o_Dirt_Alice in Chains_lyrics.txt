Ay-ah, yay-ah
Ah-ay-ah-ah
Ay-ah, ay-na
Ah-ay-ah-ah, aw

I have never felt such frustration
Or lack of self-control
I want you to kill me and dig me under
I wanna live no more

One who doesn't care is one who shouldn't be
I've tried to hide myself from what is wrong for me
For me

I want to taste dirty, a stinging pistol
In my mouth, on my tongue
I want you to scrape me from the walls
And go crazy like you've made me

One who doesn't care is one who shouldn't be
I've tried to hide myself from what is wrong for me
One who doesn't care is one who shouldn't be
I've tried to hide myself from what is wrong for me
For me, yeah

Yeah

You, you are so special
You have the talent to make me feel like dirt
And you, you use your talent to dig me under
And cover me with dirt

One who doesn't care is one who shouldn't be
I've tried to hide myself from what is wrong for me
One who doesn't care is one who shouldn't be
I've tried to hide myself from what is wrong for me

Ay-ah, ay-ah
Ah-ay-ah-ah
Ay-ah, ay-aw12Embed
