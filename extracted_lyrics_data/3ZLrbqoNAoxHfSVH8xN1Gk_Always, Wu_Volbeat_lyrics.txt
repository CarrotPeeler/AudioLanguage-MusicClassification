5 ContributorsAlways, Wu Lyrics
Sickness hide inside
Eating flesh by time
The saddest news I have in mind
But I know you man
A heart like no one else
Keeps the fire glow my friend

If I lose you, with the smile you do
If I lose you
In the morning, in the final sleep
If I lose you

Only one to know
And I promise you
Nothing change unless you say
But I know you man
A heart like no one else
Keeps the fire glow my friend

If I lose you, with the smile you do
If I lose you
In the morning, in the final sleep
If I lose you
You might also like
Carry on 'cause there's no place to hide
Find the oath and feel
Our love for you is for all endless time
Alone you never be

If I lose you, with the smile you do
If I lose you
In the morning, in the final sleep
If I lose you

In the morning, in the final sleep
If I lose youEmbed
