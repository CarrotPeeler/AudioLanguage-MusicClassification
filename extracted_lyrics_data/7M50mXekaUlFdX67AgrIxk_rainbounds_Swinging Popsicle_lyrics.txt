1 ContributorRainbounds LyricsAllow some orders, orders are orders
You should get ready, you know what I'm sayin'?
I feel your heartbeat, now are you ready?
It's just an order, over the border
I commend your freein' your mind
I commend your darin' to say "Ahh!"
I can see you in the rainbounds!
'Cause that's where we can be in comfort
I'll see you in the rainbounds!
'Cause that's where we can be all day
I'm gonna take you there, how romantic!
I'm gonna save your kiss, my darlin'
I'm gonna save your kiss, my darlin'
Hey, d'you know, I love the way you do!
Allow some orders, orders are orders
You should get ready, you know what I'm sayin'?
Ride on the highway! Please keep on runnin'!
Around the corner, speak up louder!
I commend your freein' your mind
I commend your darin' to say "Ahh!"
I can see you in the rainbounds!
'Cause that's where we can be in comfort
I'll see you in the rainbounds!
'Cause that's where we can be all day
I'm gonna take you there, how romantic!
I'm gonna save your kiss, my darlin'
I'm gonna save your kiss, my darlin'
Hey, d'you know, I love the way you do!
