Come on

This is our moment, will you stand with me?
Hope is not lost, love is not lost
Let the strength of your words be the spark that ignites the flames
Proclaim your freedom, give voice to your liberation

This is my confession
Mark these words, we will rise

Weep no more
(Weep no more)
We will prevail
(We will prevail)
Grieve no more
(Grieve no more)
We will prevail
(We will prevail)

Revoke the needless way of affliction, revoke and abandon
We are the offer, ministers of our faith, we have a solution

This is my confession
Mark these words, we will rise

Weep no more
(Weep no more)
We will prevail
(We will prevail)
Grieve no more
(Grieve no more)
We will prevail
(We will prevail)

Hope is, hope is not lost
Hope is, hope is not lost

Weep no more
(Weep no more)
We will prevail
(We will prevail)
Grieve no more
(Grieve no more)
We will prevail
(We will prevail)
This is our moment, will you stand with me? (Stand with me)
Hope is not lost, hope is not lostEmbed
