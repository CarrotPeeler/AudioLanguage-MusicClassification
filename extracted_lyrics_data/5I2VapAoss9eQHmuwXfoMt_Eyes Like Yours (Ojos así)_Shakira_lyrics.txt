29 ContributorsEyes Like Yours (Ojos Así) Lyrics
Oh, you know I have seen a sky without sun
A man with no nation
Saints captive in chains
A song with no name for lack of imagination

And I have seen darker than ebony
And now it seems, that I
Without your eyes, could never be

My one desire, all I aspire
Is in your eyes forever to live
Traveled all over the seven oceans
There is nothing that I wouldn't give
Came from Bahrein, got to Beirut
Looking for someone comparing to you
Tearing down windows and doors
And I could not find eyes like yours
Came from Bahrein, got to Beirut
Looking for someone comparing to you
Tearing down windows and doors
And I could not find eyes like yours

Oh, you know I seen a woman of means
In rags and begging for pleasure
Crossed a river of salt just after I rode
A ship that's sunk in the desert
See Shakira LiveGet tickets as low as $50You might also like
And I have seen darker than ebony
And now it seems, that I
Without your eyes, could never be

My one desire, all I aspire
Is in your eyes forever to live
Traveled all over the seven oceans
There is nothing that I wouldn't give
Came from Bahrein, got to Beirut
Looking for someone comparing to you
Tearing down windows and doors
And I could not find eyes like yours
Came from Bahrein, got to Beirut
Looking for someone comparing to you
Tearing down windows and doors
And I could not find eyes like yours


رَبُّ السَّماءِ, فيك الرجاءِ
في عينيها أرى حياتي
آتِي إِلَيْكَ مِنْ هَذا الكَوْنِ
أرجوك, رَبِّي, لَبِّي نِدائي
من البحرين إلى بيروت
Looking for someone comparing to you
Tearing down windows and doors
And I could not find eyes like yours
My one desire, all I aspire
Is in your eyes forever to live
Traveled all over the seven oceans
There is nothing that I wouldn't give
Came from Bahrein, got to Beirut
Looking for someone comparing to you
Tearing down windows and doors
And I could not find eyes like yours1Embed
