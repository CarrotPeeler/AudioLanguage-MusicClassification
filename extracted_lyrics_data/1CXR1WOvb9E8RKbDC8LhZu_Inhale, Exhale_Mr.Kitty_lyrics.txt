Rub the salt into my wound
This is what I've done to you
You left because you were not strong
Donâ€™t hold your breath, I won't be long


Inhale exhale poison fumes
Precious cancers inside you
Inhale exhale magic dust
We are strangers you can trust
Inhale exhale poison fumes
Precious cancers inside you
Inhale exhale magic dust
We are strangers you, can, trust

Broken glass beneath my feet
I will not admit defeat
The sun burns deep into my eyes
I will not give into lies

Inhale exhale poison fumes
Precious cancers inside you
Inhale exhale magic dust
We are strangers you can trust
Inhale exhale poison fumes
Precious cancers inside you
Inhale exhale magic dust
We are strangers you, can, trustEmbed
