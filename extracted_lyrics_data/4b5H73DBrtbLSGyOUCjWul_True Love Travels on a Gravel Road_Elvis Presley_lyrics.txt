6 ContributorsTrue Love Travels On A Gravel Road LyricsHow many girls choose cotton dress worlds when they could have satins and lace
And stand by her man, never once letting shame touch her face?
How many hearts could live through all the winters we've known and still not be cold?
True love travels on a gravel road
Love is a stranger and hearts are in danger on smooth streets paved with gold
Oh, true love travels on a gravel road, oh
Down through the years, we've had hard times and tears, but they only helped our love grow
And we'll stay together no matter how strong the wind blows
Not once have I seen your blue eyes filled with envy or stray from the one that you hold
Oh, true love travels on a gravel road
Love is a stranger and hearts are in danger on smooth streets paved with gold
Oh, true love travels on a gravel road
Yeah, true love travels on a gravel road
True love travels on a gravel road, oh, yeah
True love travels on a gravel road
True love travels on a gravel roadYou might also likeEmbed
