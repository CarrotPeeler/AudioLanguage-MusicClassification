2 ContributorsHollywoodâ€™s Message LyricsA little while ago, we want you to know
Just who you've been listening to
Say listen to me now while I tell you how
Who I am and what I do
5' 9" and a half, bow-legged as you ever wanted to see
Just twist off a bottle of booze baby doll, cause he's talkin' about little ol' me
It's Hollywood and I'm so glad that you came on down
So we can spend some time together, maybe even mess around
Said you look so good, you look so fine, you make me shake and shiver
But in the end, when it all comes down you know the Hollywood will deliver
I'm big, bad, powerful, I'm the only one that's original
From the beginning baby, where it stand
Hollywood just your brother man
Comin' to you baby makin' plenty of sense
Gettin' cash money just to pay my rent
So once again baby as a matter of fact
Get back everybody stop smokin' that crack
When you hear the sound of the music
You know it's gonna be fine
And it's me, I'm DJ Hollywood
The only one, mankind
There are only two art forms
One is jazz and one is me
So get back baby, check it out, I'm doing a new joint
To the hip hop, the hip hop
The hibbie hibbie hip hop ya don't stop
Once again, baby doll, in your neighborhood
Who's that? (DJ Hollywood)
Who's that? (DJ Hollywood)
You might also likeWhat's that? (DJ Hollywood)
Everybody else, that you hear, sounds just like me my dear
Say  stop playing, so you can hear everything I'm saying
Get up, c'mon
Hey, I'm not gonna pay a lot for this muffler
Remember it's true, and just because of you, it's me
DJ Hollywood-wood
C'mon, let's go to work
Cause I need money that I can jerk
To the hotel, to the motel
Just toot your horn and ring your bell
See it's up my back, around my neck
Woo-ha! Got your girls in check
Once again, baby doll what-choo lookin' at?
It's me Hollywood (Not smokin' crack)
Get up baby, rock over here, the party is rockin' tonight
And if you listen to the sound, the groove is nice
And everything's out of sight
You see everybody's ready to rock the house in the name of Hollywood
Goddamn right and if you feel the groove
C'mon baby, move like ya should
To the left, right - the right to left
Let's do it til ya do it to death
Then party hearty like everybody
Move every muscle that's in your body
Listen up closely while I'm talking to you
One more thing I want you to do
Get off your boat, get-get on your feet
Rock-rock and roll to the funky beat
Hey you over there, sittin' in your chair
Actin' like a square from Delaware
Get up, baby, let's start the party
Movin' every muscle that's in your body
I'm calling it out like a sergeant in the army
Once again baby, nice and charmy
Wanting you to sit back, relax
And check it out while I cut the facts
Like facts and  with impact
React to the facts, get on track
Don't beat around the bush, be exact
Because the  deal with just the facts
When the  man says it's time to pay your tax
He says "Look at here I want just the facts"
Tell ya something that happened to me
Tried to give my job to a refugee
But that's alright, that's okay
I'm still here rockin' this  today
Comin' at you baby like the old school
Hollywood baby with number two
I got the sound, you got the mix
Everybody in the mornin' gettin' their kicks
Cheerios, popcorn
C'mon, somebody let's get it on
On and on and on and on
Like what? (Ooh!) Popcorn
What? (Ooh!) Popcorn
I'm not gonna pay a lot for this muffler
Bonafide, serenfied and I'm qualified to do
Just anything your heart can stand it all depends on you
See I've never lost a battle yet and I don't never would
Cause it's not how good I make it baby it's how I make it good
I'm listed in the yellow pages all around the world
I got twenty years experience in loving sweet young girls
I'm the king of the woman's world, they tell me from town to town
And when I find a deserving queen, I'm gonna share my crown
But until I meet my match I think I'm gonna have some fun
Gonna keep on bustin' around now baby and staying on the run
Now I don't know but I've been told by a brother that is hipper
64,000 weeping husbands, been calling me Holly the ripper
They say I'm spreading heartbreak just like a stray
But all I'm guilty of is sending you love 
So if your woman is fine my brother, might be a crying shame
Because I might can't control my head and it'll be a  thing
Just word to the wise, wise to the word
C'mon baby girl let's have some nerve
Let's get on the floor, start to shake
C'mon baby, start that earthquake!
Have you rockin' and rollin', rollin' and rockin'
Doin' it baby and never stoppin
Turn that music up for good!
Taste of me, I'm Hollywood
With a hip hop
Hibbie to the hibbie
A hip hop
Hibbie to the hibbie
A hip hop
Hibbie to the hibbie
I didn't  on y'allEmbed
