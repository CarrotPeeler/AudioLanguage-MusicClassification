Yo, Lani, you made this one?

All of our beef gets seasoned (Soul huntin' opp)
How you think us man whacked out High Trees? (Right now)
Fill up the whip, let's do this quietly
Try me, you can meet God Almighty (Can meet him)
Leng one say I look Chinese (Huh?)
Gold or brown, they all wan' pipe me (Huh?)
Rambos twinnin' (Aye), that's hashtag high knees (Aye)
SOS, tell a boy "Come try me"
Bro got first blood, so it's his blade reckoned (Blade, blade)SOS, get the drop done nicely
Bro juiced this kitchen, had it all slimy
Hit the M's with blood on his Nikeys (Yep)
We apply that pressure, it's more than slightly
Pull up and knife G's, cause them crime scenes
My brown one's bougie, why she's so feisty?
'Cause I'm cheatin' again, now, she's there tryna fight me

Think fast and tie them laces (Run)
Yohan Blake when they clocked our faces (Cut)
Wave it, shave it and keep on placin' (Wave it, wave it)
Rambo tucked, let's go do flavours (Ying that)
We made Stompy famous (Us)
We think 'bout him when we're smokin' flavours
Opp block tour, gotta hide our faces
'Cah me, I can't catch no cases (Can't catch none)
S1, he wanted to eat (Mm)
He died on scene, doctors couldn't save him
Jump out gang, who's the fastest? Chase him
Go ask shh how the rambo tasted (Come 'ere)
I used to be cool with the paigons
Now, I'm a paigon, I bet they're mad
Dangerous, tryna make a mill like Meek
Now, I'm attractin' the T with cats and crack
Don't really care about races, black or white, you can still get tanned
I bleached out shanks and purged off flats
That's A-team lurkin' the main road, gang (Now)
They couldn't go to their local shops
You're smokin' rocks if you think they can (They're not allowed, they're not allowed)
I don't mean to brag, but the opps are shit, they don't ride on man (They don't)

All of our beef gets seasoned
How you think us man whacked out High Trees? (Right now)
Fill up the whip, let's do this quietly
Try me, you can meet God Almighty (Can meet him)
Leng one say I look Chinese (Huh?)
Gold or, brown, they all wan' pipe me (Huh?)
Rambos twinnin' (Aye), that's hashtag high knees (Aye)
SOS, tell a boy "Come try me"
Bro got first blood, so it's his blade reckoned (Blade, blade)
SOS, get the drop done nicely
Bro juiced this kitchen, had it all slimy
Takes the M with blood on his Nikeys (Yep)
We apply that pressure, it's more than slightly
Pull up and knife G's, cause them crime scenes
My brown one's bougie, why she's so feisty?
'Cause I'm cheatin' again, now, she's there tryna fight me

I love P Sits 'cah he plays his part (Gang, gang)
My nigga Dripz got so much heart (Free him)
Gang put opps in rizzlers, Sesh did run, only scratchin' arms
Throw up C, you gonna fly with your dawg
Addin' K's on the mandem, mad ting, it's nuttin' to get man rassed
Shh tried run, didn't make it far (Dosed)
Shh tried run, didn't make it far (No), so he left with scars (No)
Tell me a time we got a drop on a top
Gang was live when we went there past (Bap)
Was first to the ride, I never been last (Facts)
It's nuttin' to done man's dance
You can get splashed for runnin' up last
Don't stand there hot if you think you have heart (Right now)
Of course, we're on shavins (Facts)
Pull up to any location
Blatant, it was me tryna back my stainless (Yeah)
He tried run, didn't make it
The gangnem shaved him, made him famous (Haha)
He tried run, didn't make it
The gangnem shaved him, made him famous
Free bro, got him sittin' in cages (Free him)
All of our beef gets seasoned
How you think us man whacked out High Trees? (Right now)
Fill up the whip, let's do this quietly
Try me, you can meet God Almighty (Can meet him)
Leng one say I look Chinese (Huh?)
