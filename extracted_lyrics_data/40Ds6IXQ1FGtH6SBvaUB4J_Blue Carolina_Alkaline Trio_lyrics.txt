It's everything that I can do right now
To not think about you moving further off
With every passing second
And every night of this lonely summertime
I feel it missing from my heart
A part was kidnapped from my soul

Well, I can hardly wait
Until I get the sun and your lips both pressing on my skin
Well, I can hardly wait
Until I feel that thrill in my heart that starts inside your eyes
And a song in my head that burns so good on my tongue

Yes, I will
Yeah
Yeah
Yes, I will

The night is aging as the sun warms your face
Won't you turn around and stay for good?
The air is getting much too cold
I am nervous and anxious, it really counts this time
And you know all my favorite singers
Have stolen all of my best lines
You might also like
Well, I can hardly wait
Until I get the sun and your lips both pressing on my skin
Well, I can hardly wait
Until I feel that thrill in my heart that starts inside your eyes
And a song in my head that burns so good on my tongue

Yes, I will
Yeah
Yeah
Yes, I will
Yeah
Yeah

Someday, I'll burn this bed, only two feet wide
Where I'll hide for the next seventeen days
I will ask myself, "How badly do I want this?"
I really want this

Well, I can hardly wait
Until I get the sun and your lips both pressing on my skin
Well, I can hardly wait
Until I feel that thrill in my heart that starts inside your eyes
And a song in my head that burns so good on my tongue
Yes, I will
Yeah
Yeah
Yes, I will
Yeah
Yeah
Yes, I will1Embed
