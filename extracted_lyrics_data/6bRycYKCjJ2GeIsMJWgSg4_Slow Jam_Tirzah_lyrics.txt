5 ContributorsSlow Jam LyricsI'm frozen, I'm sorry, my son
But you're too old to hold my hand, you must move on
Keep your hair neat, do some hard work
Just call me sometimes, let me know you're OK, you'll find
I know you'll survive
Look me in the eyes
You can take a risk or two
But don't do anything I wouldn't do
I know you'll survive
Look me in the eyes
You can take a risk or two
But don't do anything I wouldn't do
Watched by everyone, tired of the pressure
Under some giant thumb, people trying to stop your fun
Telling you to wait, finding out you're too late
You used to look forward to it, now you're bored of it
I know you'll survive
Look me in the eyes
You can take a risk or two
But don't do anything I wouldn't do
I know you'll survive
Look me in the eyes
You can take a risk or two
But don't do anything I wouldn't do

This is your home, you are not alone
You are not alone, you are not alone
This is your home, you are not aloneEmbed
