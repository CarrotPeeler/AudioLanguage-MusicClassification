A light drains in
Under the door
I tried to sleep away the
Hundreds of days before
But I'm still here

Locked in chains
Under the floor
Cover my lips
Chloroform

A bowl of food
A sponge to clean
Myself of any pride and
Polish humility
I'm here for you

Locked in chains
Under the floor
Cover my lips
Chloroform

[And I fear that I'm never coming home
And I fear that I'm never coming home
I'm never coming home](30819749)

Locked in chains
Under the floor
Cover my lips
Chloroform
Duct taped eyes
Fear no more
It's over now
