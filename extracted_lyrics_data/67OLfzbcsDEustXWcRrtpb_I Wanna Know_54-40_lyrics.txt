1 ContributorI Wanna Know LyricsI'm standing lonely
Just a waiting for a call
Know I'm not the only one at all
Don't like going nowhere
When I stroll along the street
Only take my orders from inside me
I wanna know
I wanna know
I wanna know where to go when I am told
I'm rubbing shoulders with the people I believe
Don't get much to eat
And I know I never ever sleep
I feel like a soldier
Just waiting to be free
Fighting for that something that says
"Hey what's in it for me?"
I wanna know
I wanna know
I wanna know where to go when I am toldYou might also likeEmbed
