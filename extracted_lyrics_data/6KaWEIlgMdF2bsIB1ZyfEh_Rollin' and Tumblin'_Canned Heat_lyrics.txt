Well, I rollin' 'n' tumbled
I cried the whole night long
Oh well, I rollin' 'n' tumbled
I cried the whole night long
Oh well, I had the feelin', baby
Something's goin' on wrong

Oh well, I really love you, baby
Come on and say you'll be mine
Oh well, I really love you, baby
Come on and say you'll be mine
Well, if you don't like my taters
Don't you dig up my vine

Oh well, I cried last night, mama
I cried the night before
Oh well, I cried last night, mama
I cried the night before
Oh well, I had the feelin', baby
You don't love me no more

Well, if the river was whiskey
I was a divin' duck
Well, if the river was whiskey
I was a divin' duck
Well, I would swim to the bottom
Baby, I wouldn't come up

Oh well, I rollin' 'n' tumbled
I cried the whole night long
Oh well, I rollin' 'n' tumbled
I cried the whole night long
Oh well, I had the feelin', baby
Something's goin' on wrongEmbed
