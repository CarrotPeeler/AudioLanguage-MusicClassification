4 ContributorsSoldiers LyricsAround the corner every morning just to see who gets across
The civic fathers divide us up into cats and dogs
The sergeant major of the neighbourhood is weighing up the cost
Of the senior transit lane
While we're standing in the rain
Worried if our head will fall
Alright, right
We'll stay together 'til the kids die just to keep it clean
Buy the weapons with the sales made from garden magazines
Strike up the ladies to bake tea cakes for the council's war machine
And they're digging up the road
And widening it just so
You can suffocate at home
Alright, right
Prince of Wales tea
To keep the garden green
But they don't want to be there
The shit can't be there
You woke me up just to check that I'm alive
We talk to each other as if we're five
Raise open the flag just to see which of us cares
And they're digging up the road
And widening it just so
You can suffocate at home
Alright, right
Alright
Alright
Alright
