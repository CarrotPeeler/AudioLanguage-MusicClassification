Well, now the club's a-rockin' and everyone's feelin' alright (Alright!)
Said on a Wednesday evening there's sure gonna be a fight (Be a fight!)
I say somebody's gonna get their head kicked in tonight
Well, now the band is groovin' and everyone's shoutin' for more (More!)
I say there's gonna be a pool of blood on the dance hall floor (On the floor!)
I say somebody's gonna get their head kicked in tonight (Ha-ha-ha-ha)

We're gonna rip up the chairs (Tear down the walls)
Mess up the place (And really have a ball)
All of us boys gonna beat off all this stress
And the whole dance floor will be a doggone mess

Well, the club's a-rockin' and everyone's feelin' alright
(Alright!)
Said on a Wednesday evening there's sure gonna be a fight (Be a fight!)
I say somebody's gonna get their head kicked in tonight
Put the boot in!


We're gonna rip up the chairs (Tear down the walls)
Smash up the place (Really have a ball)
All of us boys gonna beat off all this stress
And the whole dance floor will be a doggone mess

I say somebody's gonna get their head...
Somebody's gonna get their head... (Hey! Hey! Hey!)
Somebody's gonna get their head kicked in tonightEmbed
