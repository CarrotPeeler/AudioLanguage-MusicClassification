We had security
Anthing she wanted
But she wanted to be free
Thought I had everything in hand
Instead she's taken everything from me
Chorus:
Good smoke and whiskey is all that's left in my life
Good smoke and whiskey
Good smoke and whiskey is all that's left in my life
Good smoke and whiskey
I said I loved her
She just laughted in my face
I thought I had her
But she put me in my place
She got the car and the color t.v
Now she's drivin' me to bankruptcy
Chorus:
Good smoke and whiskey is all that's left in my life
Good smoke and whiskey
Good smoke and whiskey is all that's left in my life
Good smoke and whiskey

I'm gonna be movin' movin' movin'movin'movin' tonight
Nothing left to do
Drink myself a million miles away from you
Ooh yes sir
Good smoke and whiskey
Runnin' around my brain
Good smoke and whiskey
Killin' all that woman pain
With a smile and a twist of the knife
She took my heart and a part of my life
Chorus:
Good smoke and whiskey is all that's left in my life
Good smoke and whiskey
Good smoke and whiskey is all that's left in my life
Good smoke and whiskey
Good smoke and whiskey
Good smoke and whiskey
Good smoke and whiskey
Good smoke and whiskey
Good smoke and whiskey
Oh yeaEmbed
