9 ContributorsTodayâ€™s Lesson Lyrics
Little Janie, she wakes up from a dream
A gun like a jawbone down the waistband of her jeans
Mr Sandman, he can recite today's lesson in his sleep
He says there oughta be some kind of law against me going down the street
And little Janie pipes up and she says
We're gonna have a real good time tonight

Down the back of Janie's jeans she had the jawbone of an ass
Mr Sandman, he runs around the corner, trying to head her off at the pass
He sticks his head over the fence and yells something way too fast
It's today's lesson, yeah, something about the corruption of the working class
Little Janie wakes up on the floor and she says
We're gonna have a real cool time tonight

Janie says we're all such a crush of want half-mad with loss
We are violated in our sleep and we weep and we toss and we turn and we burn
We are hypnotised we are cross-eyed we are pimped we are bitched
We are told such monstrous lies
Janie wakes up and she says
We're gonna have a real good time tonight

Mr Sandman, he has a certain appetite for Janie in repose
He digs her pretty knees and that she is completely naked underneath all her clothes
He likes to congregate around the intersection of Janie's jeans
Mr Sandman the inseminator he opens her up like a love letter and enters her dreams
Little Janie wakes up and she says
We're gonna have a real good time
