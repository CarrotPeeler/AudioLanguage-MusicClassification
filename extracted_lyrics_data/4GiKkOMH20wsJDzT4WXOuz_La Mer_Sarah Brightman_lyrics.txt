1 ContributorLa Mer LyricsAncient unknown mammals
On a stormy sea
Like Buddha in the water
A velvet energy
As the night takes over
The spirits of the deep
Marvel at his majesty
The whale is in his sleep
Oh, la mer
You're shimmering through
Oh, la mer
Magnificent blue
Shimmering through the water
In search of sanctuary
Currents travel faster
In alien territory
Dancing in the distance
In a puff of spray
In a single moment
The dolphin glides away
Oh, la mer
You're shimmering through
Oh, la mer
Magnificent blueSee Sarah Brightman LiveGet tickets as low as $46You might also likeEmbed
