Let's go!

What's the problem?
Why can't you relax?
Inside hating on everything
That makes me mad
Love is scary and love is to blame
Guess I'll lose you and that is a shame
'Cause I'm over you
Over you
Over you
Over you
Over you
Over you
Over you
Let's go!

I'm taking over
I won't be lead astray
Life's doesn't last long
I gotta get away

The solution I try to reveal
But the question is
How can you really be healed?
Hate is scary and hate is to blame
God I need you and that is a shame
'Cause I need you
I need you
I need you
I need you
I need you
I need you
I need you
Let's go!

I'm taking over
I won't be lead astray
Life's doesn't last long
I gotta get away

Let's go!

I'm taking over
I won't be lead astray
Life's doesn't last long
I gotta get away
I'm taking over
I won't be lead astray
Life's doesn't last long
I gotta get away1Embed
