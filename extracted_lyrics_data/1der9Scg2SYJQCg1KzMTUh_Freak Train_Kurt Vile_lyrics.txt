5 ContributorsFreak Train LyricsGo ahead, tell me "hello" or "fuck you"
Whatever introduction suits you
I ain't trying to fight
I'm just trying to ride this train and make it home tonight
Hey, I don't care if you care
Or if you're trying to break my nose
Or just stand around
Stare me down and cough
Where the hell do you get off, anyway?
Freak train
Well, there's people out there who tell you lies
They get off on giving wrong directions
Well, fabrication's my best friend
But I ain't never been so insulted in my whole life
Riding on the freak train
Train, train, train
Riding on the freak train
Train, train, train
Riding on the freak train
Train, train, train
Riding on the freak train, yeah
Well, there's a whole new story there
Well, there's a whole new story there
Well, there's a whole new story there

And drag it everywhere
Whoo!
One day, I'm going to get enough dough
To get me where I want to go comfortably
They say Acela rides a little faster
But for now, it's freaks and how and "Whoa, get off me!"
Cause a man with hands for every finger
Claiming he's a folk singer
And he's raring to bite his nails
Think I'd rather ride the rails
Riding on the freak train
Train, train, train
Riding on the freak train
Train, train, train
Riding on the freak train
Train, train, train
Riding on the freak train, yeah
Well, there's a whole new story there
Well, there's a whole new story there
Well, there's a whole new story there
Let it hang out like you just don't care
And drag it everywhere
Whoo!
Well, there's people out there who tell you lies
They get off on giving wrong directions
Well, fabrication's my best friend
But I ain't never been so insulted in my whole life
Shit!
Riding on the freak train
Train, train, train
Riding on the freak train
Train, train, train
Riding on the freak train
Train, train, train
Riding on the freak train, yeah
Well, there's a whole new story there
Well, there's a whole new story there
Well, there's a whole new story there
Let it hang out like you just don't care
And drag it everywhere
Whoo!Embed
