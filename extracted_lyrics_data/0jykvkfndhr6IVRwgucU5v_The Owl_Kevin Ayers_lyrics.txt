The way you blink it makes me think
Of things to say and things to do
But most of all of loving you

Oh sweet owl, if you leave I'll howl
'Cause you're the one for me and it feels right to be
Together now and forever
Oh what a beautiful owl you are
I'll say it again you are you are
Through crazy weather we've sailed out boat
And I don't know how but we're still afloat

Oh what a beautiful owl you are
The way you blink it makes me think
Of things to say and things to do
But most of all of loving you
