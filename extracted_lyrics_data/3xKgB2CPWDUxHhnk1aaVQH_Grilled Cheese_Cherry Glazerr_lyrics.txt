Grilled cheese
In my mouth
Get on your knees
If you want a bite
Go fly a kite

Got the bread, got the cheese
Make me a grilled cheese, please
Try and steal a bite
We'll get in a fight

Grilled cheese
In my mouth
Get on your knees
If you want a bite
Go fly a kite

It's all about the butter
Make one for your mother
Then I'll make you another
Oh
You might also like
Grilled cheese
In my mouth
Get on your knees
If you want a bite
Go fly a kite

Grilled cheese
In my mouth
Grilled cheese
In my mouth5Embed
