1 ContributorSoul in Isolation LyricsDo you remember the day we met
I remember the innocence in your eyes
Do you remember the words we said
You promised me to be the one to love me eternally
I never lied
I never lied to you
I promised you to be the one to never let you down
I never lied
I never lied to you
Have you never seen, the dark clouds in the sky were hunting me
Can you hold me for the last time
There is no time for me to lose
I feel my soul is lost in isolation
Can you hold me for the last time
My time is running out
Every second I still got
Turns into desperationYou might also likeEmbed
