45 ContributorsHitchinâ€™ a Ride Lyrics

Hey, mister, where you headed?
Are you in a hurry?
Need a lift to happy hour
Say oh no
Do you brake for distilled spirits?
I need a break as well
The well that inebriates the guilt
One, two, one, two, three, four

Cold turkey's gettin' stale
Tonight, I'm eatin' crow
Fermented salmonella, poison oak, no
There's a drought at the fountain of youth
Now I'm dehydrated
My tongue is swellin' up, I say
One, two, one, two, three, four

Troubled times, you know I cannot lie
I'm off the wagon and I'm hitchin' a ride

There's a drought at the fountain of youth
Now I'm dehydrated
My tongue is swellin' up, I said
Shit

Troubled times, you know I cannot lie
I'm off the wagon and I'm hitchin' a ride

(Don't know where I'm goin') Hitchin' a ride
(Don't know where I'm goin') Hitchin' a ride
(Don't know where I'm goin') Hitchin' a ride
(Don't know where I'm goin') Hitchin' a ride
(Don't know where I'm goin') Hitchin' a ride
(Don't know where I'm goin') Hitchin' a ride
(Don't know where I'm goin') Hitchin' a ride
Say birthday boys, hey11Embed
