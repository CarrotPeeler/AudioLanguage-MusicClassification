8 ContributorsMean Man Lyrics
A tattooed madman, I am hell on wheels
Born a wicked child, left alone in the fields
My father was the wind, my mother was fire
Raised by the wolves and I grew up wild
A kamikaze man a-hollerin' "Banzai"
Never crash and burn, never gonna die
Cannibal is me, you squeal and shout
I chew you up and spit you out

Storms a-c-c-coming and it's gonna be me
Here comes Trouble, with a capital "T"

'Cause I'm a mean motherfucking man
I gotta scream, that's what I am
All the way, all all the way
'Cause I'm a mean motherfucking man
Riding the wind and know I'll be damned
All the way, all all the way, all the way

Chewbacca in the rye, the ruler of fire
A terror in the flesh, a killer for hire
California man, I'm white line, "Homer"
The unruly one they call the "Blonde Bomber"
Scooter gypsy, I'm a renegade
An orphan of the road, a live hand grenade
Never gonna quit before my time
When the moon gets high, then I'll be blind
See W.A.S.P. LiveGet tickets as low as $35You might also like
Mad dog, 20-20's king
I drink that stuff and start getting obscene

'Cause I'm a mean motherfucking man
I gotta scream, that's what I am
All the way, all all the way
'Cause I'm a mean motherfucking man
Riding the wind and know I'll be damned
All the way, all all the way, all the way

I'm a motorcycle man, don't never give a damn
I lie when the truth serves better
The Marquis de Sade, I cheat and steal and rob
A heavy metal creature

'Cause I'm a mean motherfucking man
I gotta scream, that's what I am
All the way, all all the way
'Cause I'm a mean motherfucking man
I gotta scream, that's what I am
All the way, all all the way
'Cause I'm a mean motherfucking man
Riding the wind and know I'll be damned
All the way, all all the wayEmbed
