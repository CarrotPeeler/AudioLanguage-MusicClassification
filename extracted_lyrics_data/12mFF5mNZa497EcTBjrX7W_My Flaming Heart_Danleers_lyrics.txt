1 ContributorCan’t Get It Up! Lyrics
She likes!
When im keeping it honest
But right now
Shes tight
But blondie is staring at me
With heart eyes
Theres danger’s flashing above her
But oh girl, the snow thats on her nose
It’s beautiful!

She hates
That i fucked all of her bestfriends
I tell her
Baby, am i with or you or with them
I drive her crazy!
She drives home while im puking
The stopsigns were green
When i saw blondie
Now i feel guilty!
You might also like

Im so drunk that i can't get it up!
Ain't happen that lasdt girl!
Im so drunk that i can't get it up!
She thinks im a fucking asshole
Im so drunk that i can't get it up!
I was happier alone!
Im so drunk that i can't get it up!
Im so drunk that i can't get it up!


I think all of her friends are annoying
They’re fucking vapid
Every parties a performance
They were their best digs
And get it trashed when they’re drinking
They hate it too
Fuck status quo
Take off your clothes

Im so drunk that i can't get it up!
Ain't happen that lasdt girl!
Im so drunk that i can't get it up!
She thinks im a fucking asshole
Im so drunk that i can't get it up!
I was happier alone!
Im so drunk that i can't get it up!
Im so drunk that i can't get it up!


We’re with you friends!  i hate you’re friends
They talk too much, &  i think i bore them
Kissing your lips, they’re chapped but i like it
X on your tongue, now we’re spinning
With your friends, i hate you’re friends
We sneak off & unbuckle my pants
You’re on top an holding my hands
I simmer down you’re dissapointed


Im so drunk that i can't get it up!
Ain't happen that lasdt girl!
Im so drunk that i can't get it up!
She thinks im a fucking asshole
Im so drunk that i can't get it up!
I was happier alone!
Im so drunk that i can't get it up!
Im so drunk that i can't get it up!Embed
