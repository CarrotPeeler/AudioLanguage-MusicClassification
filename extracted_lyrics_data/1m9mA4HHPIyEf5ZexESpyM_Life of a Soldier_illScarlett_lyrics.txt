1 ContributorLife Of A Soldier Lyrics
You're at home, I'm away
And if all I can say
Is that this boy is still the same
It's the man inside that's changed
Front of the line but still behind
Seems like I'm trying way too hard
And like I haven't tried at all
Hard as stone but feeling all the weight
Feeling all the weight that's crushing me
When you come around
You're like a little slice of heaven
When I'm coming down
Lifting me up above the clouds

I'll sleep tonight but the war's far from over
Tomorrow is no guarantee
If I don't return from this life of a soldier
Don't you be crying for me

Throw this all away
Nothing comes for free at least that's what they say
If I had the chance I'd do it all again
If I had the chance I'd do it all again
Racing against the clock trying to relieve the pressure
Pushing you away so we can be together
Carry me today, I'll carry you forever
Let's take a chance and we'll see if this won't last
Hard as a stone but feeling all the weight
Feeling all the weight that's crushing me
When you come around
You're like a little slice of heaven
When I'm coming down
Lifting me up above the clouds
You might also like
I'll sleep tonight but the war's far from over
Tomorrow is no guarantee
If I don't return from this life of a soldier
Don't you be crying for me

There's a car pulling up and the man who's inside
Takes a deep breath as he straightens his tie
It's nothing new cause he's done this before
She knew it as soon as he knocked on the door
Please someone please tell me I must be dreaming
What will I do? Oh, I just can't believe it
Taken away, oh, he's taken away
Someone take me away, someone take me away

I'll sleep tonight but the war's far from over
Tomorrow is no guarantee
If I don't return from this life of a soldier
Don't you be crying for me

Nothing comes for free at least that's what the say
If I had the chance I'd do it all againEmbed
