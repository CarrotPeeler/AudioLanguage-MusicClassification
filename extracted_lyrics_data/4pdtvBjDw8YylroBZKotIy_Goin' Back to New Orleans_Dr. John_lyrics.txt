To the land of the beautiful queen
Goin back to home to my baby
Goin' back to New Orleans
(Spoken:
On the double, here comes the Neville Brothers!)
Seeing na-na, my parin
Couzine and my ma and pa
Want to plant my feet on Rampart Street
Be there for the Mardi Gras
Goin' back home, fe nan e'
And never more will I roam
Goin get me fill of that etoufee
Cus New Orleans is my home
(Spoken:
Is that a jumbo jet?
No, that's Big Al comin' to put a hurt on you)
(Spoken:
On the level, there's Charlie Neville)
Get some crawfish, jambalaya
Red beans and fine pralines
Get some lovin' that gonna satisfy
Home in New Orleans

Home, sweet home

In the land of the Carnival Queen
I'm goin' back home to my baby
