2 ContributorsWhy LyricsI don't think about it anymore
So why do you
I don't remember much
But I'm sure that we were through
I'm looking for your eyes
To search for what they
Might disguise
So why do you
I've got no problem
So why do you
You're blowing on the ashes
That's what I think you do
It's been a secret that never got
That deep inside
So it hurt the spot
At any time
That deep inside
To hurt the spot
At any time
After all this time
Why would I
Turn around for you?
The truth has faded
Into a lie
Among all things that
I could do
I obviously still bother you
Why do I
You might also likeI'm just wishing
You could forgive
It is what we do, to make
Life easier to liveEmbed
