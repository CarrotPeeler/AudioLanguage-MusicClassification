1 ContributorSex Killer LyricsKing Solomon sittin' still
He sits on his grave
The tourists are singing
"Home on the Range"
He wigs out in the Frolic Room
And breaks all the mirrors
And someone starts yelling
"Man, he is weird!"
Sex killer
Sex killer
Sex killer
Now, he is bound to get you!
I used to hate Solo
He hated me the same
I used to hate Solo
Had to see him every day
He turned my wife to the mud
His mass abused my son
He put me on his altar for kicks
Then, he said, "you are sick"
Sex killer
Sex killer
Sex killer
Man, he is bound to get you!

He watches the clock
He's waiting for God
To come out of the box
But, the feminists move it
And break down the doors
He jumps up with a rubber nose
And says, "you're a bore"
Sex killer
Sex killer
Sex killer
Man, he is bound to get you!Embed
