3 ContributorsConfessinâ€™ Midnight LyricsMidnight and the jailer's watching
Thin dime can buy a soul
Midnight come and get me
In time you will start to know
Justified in satisfying
Your every sweet desire
Justified in satisfying
Your every sweet desire
Midnight black cat creeping
Headlights straight up ahead
While I watch the shadows
Sleep tight my sleepy-head
Justified in satisfying
Your every sweet desire
Justified in satisfying
Your every sweet desire
Midnight steam is rising
Got no self-control
Midnight beast is raging
In time you will start to know
You're justified in satisfying
Your every sweet desire
But don't you ever wonder if there could be something higher?
