A.C.A.B, A.C.A.B, A.C.A.B, A.C.A.B!

See them walking down the streets all day - A.C.A.B
See them walking down the streets all night - A.C.A.B
Never heard of human dignity - A.C.A.B
Working for a fascist machinery - A.C.A.B

They say it's law and order but we live in fear
Fuck off cops, get out of here
All cops are bastards
All cops are bastards
All cops are bastards

See them driving with their blue lights on - A.C.A.B
See them holding their tommy-guns - A.C.A.B
Beatin' up people without any reason - A.C.A.B
Supported by the law and the politicans - A.C.A.B

They say it's law and order but we live in fear
Fuck off cops, get out of here
All cops are bastards
All cops are bastards
All cops are bastards

See them walking down the streets all day - A.C.A.B
See them walking down the streets all night - A.C.A.B
Never heard of human dignity - A.C.A.B
Working for a fascist machinery - A.C.A.B

They say it's law and order but we live in fear
Fuck off cops, get out of here
All cops are bastards
All cops are bastards
All cops are bastards
All cops are bastards
All cops are bastards
All cops are bastards
All cops are bastardsEmbed
