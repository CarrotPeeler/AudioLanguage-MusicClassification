It's in your mind, girl
Ooh, I know you wanna love me
But it's life in the empty city
In this place
Love goes astray
In this place
Love lost the way
Ooh, I know you wanna love me
But it's life in the empty city
Love goes astray
So cold, so cold girl
I saw you were cold
In these streets
Oh, girl
You're living in the city
Ooh, I know you wanna love me
But it's life in the empty city
In this place
Love goes astray
In this place
Love goes astray
You might also likeOoh, I know you wanna love me
But that's life in the empty city
Ooh, I know you wanna love me
But it's life in the empty city
So cold in the street
No eye contact in these streets
Streets, in these streets
