1 ContributorSummertime Lyrics
Winter cold, gloves and stockin's
Temperatures droppin'
To and fro through sleet and snow
Can't wait to get home
'Cause when we set it off, the clothes come off
And the cold don't mean nothin'
Its hot like an oven when we get to lovin'
You keep that soft and warm

And it's hot to death
But your body makes me want to do it 'til I'm out of breath
And we soakin' wet
We out the storm up in this room, let's get it on

Just 'cause its cold outside (Cold outside)
And the sun ain't shinin' (Shinin')
That don't mean me and you can't get to sweatin'
Just like it's summertime (Summertime)
It might be cold out there (Cold out there)
It's hot as the Fourth of July up in here
'Cause we change the weather when we get together
Baby, oh, let's make it summertime
You might also like
Makin' love over an hour
Then we lay still, feelin' the chill
Wrapped up in a comfy quilt
Makin' body heat when bodies meet
From front to back, think I better check the thermostat
'Bout to pass out, girl, but I ain't mad
'Cause it's the greatest sex I've ever had

And it's hot to death
But your body makes me want to do it 'til I'm out of breath
And we soakin' wet
We out the storm up in this room let's get it on

Just 'cause its cold outside (Cold outside)
And the sun ain't shinin' (Shinin')
That don't mean me and you can't get to sweatin'
Just like it's summertime (Summertime)
Cold out there (Cold out there)
It's hot like the Fourth of July in here
'Cause we change the weather when we get together
Baby, oh, let's make it summertime

Shiverin' and shakin'
Not from the cold but from the love we're love makin'
It could be December if we keep kissin'
We're gonna need some air condition
Got a fifth of Bacardi, sack of that Marley
Windows are foggy, woah
And we can make summer wherever we go
Just 'cause its cold outside (Cold outside)
And the sun ain't shinin' (Shinin')
That don't mean me and you can't get to sweatin'
Just like it's summertime (Summertime)
It might be cold out there (Cold out there)
It's hot as the Fourth of July up in here
'Cause we change the weather when we get together
Baby, oh, let's make it summertime

La-la-la, la, la (La-la-la, la, la)
Ho, oh, oh (Ho, oh, oh, summertime)
La-la-la, la, la (La-la-la, la, la)
La, ha
La-la-la, la, la (La-la-la, la, la)
H-h-ho, oh, oh (H-h-ho, oh, oh)
La-la-la, la, la (La-la-la, la, la)Embed
