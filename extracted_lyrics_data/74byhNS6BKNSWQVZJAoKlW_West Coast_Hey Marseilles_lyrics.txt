2 ContributorsWest Coast Lyrics
Meet me on the west coast
In the salt air
Breathe slow
Go out to the unknown
We'll make it our own
Meet me on the west coast
We'll make it our own

She said
The new year's sky's a haze
From the back rooms of champagne
That New York city night
The first time your lips found mine
The moment everything had changed
Everything had changed
Everything had changed

Meet me on the west coast
In the salt air
Breathe slow
Go out to the unknown
We'll make it our own
Meet me on the west coast
You might also like
Concrete in red
Through apartment window panes
We find a room to slip away
Curtain holds out the light
With your hands folded in mine
The moment everything had changed
Everything had changed
Everything has changed

Meet me on the west coast
In the salt air
Breathe slow
Go out to the unknown
We'll make it our own
Meet me on the west coast

You can run away
Take a moment to see, a moment to be
All the things you need
This love isn't over yet
I will run away
To the mountains and rain, the sun in L.A
Away for another day
We can begin again
Meet me on the west coast
Meet me on the west coast
Meet me on the west coast
In the salt air
Breathe slow
Go out to the unknown
We'll make it our own
Meet me on the west coast
We'll make it our own
Meet me on the west coast
We'll make it our ownEmbed
