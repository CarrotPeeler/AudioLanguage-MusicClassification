1 ContributorThe Circle LyricsCloudless
Nothing but sky over me
Peacefulness
How in this world could it be
Nameless
Ghostly, you shelter my flame
I am helpless
In the black light it's a shame
I'm in the middle of a dream
I just don't know what it means
I am at war with my fear
And I'm lost in the circle again
Powerless
Only the strong will prevail
Childless
Alone on this ship I will sail
Faceless
You try and reach for my soul
I'm helpless
In the black light down the hole
I'm in the middle of a dream
I just don't know what it means
I am at war with my fear
And I'm lost in the circle again
You might also likeChildless
Alone on this ship I will sail
Lord I'm helpless
I'm lonely and feeling so frail
I'm in the middle of a dream
I just don't know what it means
I am at war with the fear
And it can only appear
And I'm lost in the circle againEmbed
