Well, I'm a stranger here and I just blowed in your town
Just because I'm a stranger everybody wants to dog me around
Well, I'm going back now south, if I have wear ninety nine pair of shoes
Well, I'm going back now south, if I have wear ninety nine pair of shoes
Then I won't be no more stranger, I won't have no more stranger's blues
Well, sometime I wonder, do my good gal know I'm here?
Well, sometime I wonder, do my good gal know I'm here?
Well, if she do, she sure don't seem to care, don't seem to careYou might also likeEmbed
