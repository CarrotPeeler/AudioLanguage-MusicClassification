2 ContributorsA Little Something LyricsThere's some stuff on my shoe
That's got nothing to do
With the places you think that I've been
And the stuff on my breath
Isn't some kiss of death
From the people you think I've been seeing
Could I please be excused? I'm very confused
I think I'd better have a little something
I think I'd like to have a little something
Though you probably forget
There's a place that we met
When we first started lying at night
It was good on the car
You would go pretty far
And you seemed like you wanted a fight
Could I please be excused? I'm very confused
I think I'd better have a little something
I think I'd like to have a little something
I think I'd better have a little something
I think I'd like to have a little something
There's a star in the sky
It's caught my eye
And I'm sure that I've seen it before
It was quite long ago
And we stood on the snow
But I can't recall where anymore

I think I'd better have a little something
I think I'd like to have a little something
I think I'd better have a little something
I think I'd like to have a little somethingEmbed
