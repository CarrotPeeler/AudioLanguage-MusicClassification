1 ContributorAnnaâ€™s Eyes LyricsI got nowhere to turn
I can't escape
Shes in my mind
Got me paralyzed
Its in her eyes
Its in my mind
Someones gonna die tonight
Shes looking at me
Everywhere i turn my head
Looking through my mind
And its driving me insane
Its in her eyes
Its in my mind
Someones gonna die tonight
White knuckles
A knife in my hands i can't help it
I can't understand
I can't escape i gotta kill
Who put the knife in my hand
I know i can't be blamed
Can't run can't look away
I can't escape this thrill
