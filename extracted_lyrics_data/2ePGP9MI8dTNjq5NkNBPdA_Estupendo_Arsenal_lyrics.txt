3 ContributorsEstupendo LyricsI travel around the world
Just to kiss you
Through airport terminals
And neon lights, i sift through
One hundred thousand miles
Of swift motion and devotion
In taxi cabs, i ride
Through traffic and commotion
Touching your perfect face
I fall into you
As our love fills the reaches of space
I dive into you
I'm channeling heat waves
Of electricity
Hitch-hiking on the noise
With melting frequencies
As snow caps tease the sky
I call out your name
And the land begins to fall
Under my waking dreams
No amount of distance can ever come between usYou might also likeEmbed
