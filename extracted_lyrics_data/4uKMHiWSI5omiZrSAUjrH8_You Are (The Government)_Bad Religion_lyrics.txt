15 ContributorsYou Are (The Government) Lyrics
Hey, sit down and listen, and they'll tell ya when you're wrong
Eradicate but vindicate as progress creeps along
Puritan work ethic maintains its subconscious edge
As Old Glory maintains your consciousness

There's a loser in the house, and a puppet on a stool
And a crowded way of life, and a black reflecting pool
And as the people bend, the moral fabric dies
Then country can't pretend to ignore its people's cries

'Cause you are the government
You are jurisprudence
You are the volition
You are jurisdiction
And I make a difference tooYou might also likeEmbed
