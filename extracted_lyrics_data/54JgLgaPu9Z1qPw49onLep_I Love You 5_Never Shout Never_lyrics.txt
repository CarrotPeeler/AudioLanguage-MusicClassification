I love you four, that's more than I can afford
And I can tell someday that I'm gonna say the truth
I love you 5
I've been walkin' around tryin' to figure out
Why I am feelin' all these feelings that I'm feeling now
And I've got more on my mind than I have got on my plate
I love you one, a two, a three shoobeedoo
I love you four, that's more than I can afford
And I can tell someday that I'm gonna say the truth
I love you five times more than any boy from before
Because all they really cared about was whether you put out
And I truly believe
This love could be
And I can count five times off the top off my head where I sucked it in
'cause you were hangin' with him
And I got something to say
I love you all the same
I love you one, a two, a three shoobeedoo
I love you four, that's more than I can afford
And I can tell someday that I'm gonna say the truth
You might also likeI love you one, a two, a three shoobeedoo
I love you four, that's more than I can afford
And I can tell someday that I'm gonna say the truth
I love you 5
