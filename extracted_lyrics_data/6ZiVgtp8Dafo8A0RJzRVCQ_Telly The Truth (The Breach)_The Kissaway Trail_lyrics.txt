1 ContributorImpossible Mission LyricsFirst Verse - Kastaway
I ride up
Slow
With the plot to take everything that motherfucker
Stole
Can’t even believe
That he took all and dreams
Fed it to a machine
Like it made
It on his on/
Now tell me am I wrong
If I want get back what he robbed
And left me with my back on the wall
Climb through window 2nd floor
Bathroom stall
With Duce Duce pack in my drawls
Call the homie Bob
Told him that I made it in/
Give me a minute than I break him in
We got a cool plot
And I hope he really don’t change the plan
This ain’t a crime
This is taking stand
You might also likeGot to door/
Than I got Bob in the spot/
Now we both focus
With our eyes on the opp
Now I really feel that lies going to stop
Kill this machine
Got my eyes on the clock this is our only shot
Second Verse- RP
Got a call from Bobby
Yo we probably gonna die
But we always got to try
Got the homies gonna drive
From the party to the crime
Caught a body on the side
Got a hottie with eye patch chilling in the ride
Im a villain when im high
But I kill em with a smile
Fill it up and live it up a
You giving up a file
A little bug I pick it up
And I hit em up down
Rip it up and zip it up
So you giving up the pound
Still slipping off your crown
While im sipping on the crown
Leave you sitting on the ground
With nothing in your pocket but a copy of account
Put the pedal to the metal
Kind of sloppy but im out
Third Verse -Bob Rok
Data breach the thinking grid
Shadows cast in purple hues
20 digit number codes
Breaking in the server room
Laser guided sensor beams
Henchman throwing judo chops
Swarmed by killer robot bees
Bursting through a gruesome slot
Watch the creature turning coat
Death and duty art and truth
Artist held in high regard
Getting lured into to the soup
Colored smoke in lingered clouds
Pouring out the open vents
Fall into a sudden trance
I'm not really certain when
Wake up in a villains cave
Shackled to a metal slab
Kastaway is to my left
Looking like he got.a plan
Followed by a sudden blast
Grab the bag and leave the mask
There's no goal in going back
Parachutes and open land
Jumpsuits in a distant field
RP in a rented car
Drive a 150 miles
Diner special breakfast bars
Train car with the misses
In a place you've never handed
A living ghost existing
With the Automat in shambles
Chorus
Impossible Mission
Hot on the scene
All the wires are blue
Inside the machine
Escaping the DOOM
Make the getaway clean
Getting cleansed by the sun
Out of mind out of reach
Impossible Mission
Hot on the scene
All the wires are blue
Inside the machine
Escaping the DOOM
Make the getaway clean
Getting cleansed by the sun
Out of mind out of reach
We are nowhere and everybody knows
We are nowhere and everybody knows
We are nowhere and everybody knows
We are nowhere and everybody knows
We are nowhere and everybody knows
We are nowhere and everybody knows
We are nowhere and everybody knows
We are nowhere and everybody knows
We are nowhere and everybody knows
We are nowhere and everybody knows
We are nowhere and everybody knows
We are nowhere and everybody knowsEmbed
