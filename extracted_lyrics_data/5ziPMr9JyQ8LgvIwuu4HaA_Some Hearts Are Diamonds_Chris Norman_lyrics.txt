2 ContributorsSome Hearts Are Diamonds LyricsOpen your heart to all of those years
Baby
You look through a rainbow of tears
You watched your dreams all fadin' away
This time youre right
Oh
You make my day
Years may come
Years may go
I still love you and I want you to know:
Some hearts are diamonds
Some hearts are stone
Some days youre tired of being alone
Some hearts are diamonds
Some hearts are stone
It takes two lovers to be as one
Illusions of love
They'll come and they'll go
Trust in your heart
Maybe your love will grow
Your silent tears so full of pride
Baby
I know that you can't run and hide
You need love like I do
I hope you want me like I know I want you
