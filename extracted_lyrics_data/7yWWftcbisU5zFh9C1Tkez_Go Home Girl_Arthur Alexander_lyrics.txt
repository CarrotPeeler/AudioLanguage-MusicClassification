Well now, me and Frank, we're the best of friends
And our friendship will never end
But it would hurt him so for him to know
That I love his girlfriend
Now, the love of a girl and the love of a friend
Are two things you can't compare
So, my heart will ache but I will let it break
'Cause I know it just ain't fair

Go on home, girl, let's call it a night
Go on home, girl, this just ain't right
But before you go I want you to know
That I love you, yes I do
Though it may break my heart
But darling we must part
'Cause I know Frank loves you too

Well, you say that we can make him see
We have a love that's really real
But I think that he is just like me
And I don't know just how he'd feel
You might also likeBut darling, I do know it would hurt him so
If you told him that it must end
And I could never hold a love I stole
From a man I call my best friend

Go on home, please, I beg of you
You know I love you, how I love you
But he does too
Go on home, please
Please go home
Go on homeEmbed
