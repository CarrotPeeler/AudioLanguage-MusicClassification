With my soul steady grooving, alright
Keep my wheels steady spinning, just fine
If I'm lost in my darkness with my soul on the pavement
Won't you speak with me, spirit?
Babe, we can't let this love run dry

When I'm gone steady going
Just try
To keep your mind on me, baby
Take time

You know my heart's on the pavement
But my soul's steady grooving
Won't you speak with me, spirit?
Babe, we can't let this love run dry
Sweet conversations

Let's keep it rolling on
Sweet conversations, child
Never go put it down
Sweet conversations
You might also like
For my heart's on the pavement
And my soul's steady grooving
Won't you speak with me, spirit?
Baby, don't let this love run dry
Sweet conversations
Sweet conversations
