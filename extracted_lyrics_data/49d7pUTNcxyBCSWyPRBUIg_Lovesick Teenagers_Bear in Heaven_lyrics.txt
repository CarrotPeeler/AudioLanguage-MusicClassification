2 ContributorsLovesick Teenagers Lyrics
Looking to the right
Our turn goes by
But not for too long
Our destination
By our misfortune
We are pulling past
Per the hour
But not for too long
So just embrace it
Our destination

Driving away from the high road
We should find a flock of birds big enough
To pull us up from the low road
Come on
Come with us
We are falling straight down, so turn us up
Loud and clear
Before we crash into the ground

Lovesick teenagers don't ever die
They will live forever
Even when you're too old
And you think you know more
And you know you know more
You'll be
You might also like
Driving away from the high road
We should find a flock of birds big enough
To pull us up from the low road
Come on
Come with us
We are falling straight down, so turn us up
Loud and clear
Before we crash into the ground
Driving away from the high road
We should find a flock of birds big enough
To pull us up from the low road
Come on
Come with us
We are falling straight down, so turn us up
Loud and clear
Before we crash into the ground1Embed
