3 ContributorsWine and Roses LyricsBring on the days of wine and roses
Riot squads and fire hoses (x2)
Two leaders try to speak but they don't make a sound
Autocrats run but they don't move around
Big money mergers but, does that move ya?
X-Ray vision I see right through ya
Do you remember when it was all bleak and black
When the old man move forwards and he never look back
But no one has a job no it's crime and torture
Cocaine epidemic and steel vultures
Stuck inside a fire that is a clearin
Super power contenders no one is daring
One super power left psychotic killer
World wide assault ya it's a thriller
You don't want to be the one who's got to go to jail
If you're lucky I.M.F. will hook you up and you'll make bail
Bring on the days of wine and roses
Riot squads and fire hoses (x2)
Bring on the days of wine and roses
Riot squads and fire hoses (x2)
The menace of success oppress rebellion
The men who play chess with the human weapons
The rally of ideas is the question
The city awaits total annihilation
Living under the muzzle of a gun this is no holiday in the sun
It's disturbing it's subversion
"V" is not for victory but for the vacant homes
