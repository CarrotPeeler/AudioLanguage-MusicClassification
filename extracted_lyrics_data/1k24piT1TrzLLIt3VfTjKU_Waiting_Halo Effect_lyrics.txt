This is what we create
We suffocate as the vultures pull the flesh
Devastation of our world
Turmoil in a place unknown
Don’t try to tell me your parable is right
Ignorance is bliss; out of sight out of mind
There was a light in the dark
But it’s burning out, eaten by the sun
Light the match
I wanna see it burn
Start the fire
There is no return
Searching
For meaning
In this world
That’s bleeding
How much are you willing to give
To find yourself and be free to exist
Tell me, do you trust the words they say?
They will bury you in an unmarked grave

How much are you willing to give
To find yourself and bе free to exist
Tell me, do you trust the words they say?
They will bury you in an unmarked grave
How much more before we learn
To fight against this broken system
That’s destroying you
A product of God’s regret
Now we burn
I see a snake waiting at every turn
Don’t let this be your tombEmbed
