3 ContributorsBlackeye LyricsSo now I got a black eye
Even though I never got smacked
But if I get a retry
Then I will try to give back
You were the one who got jacked
And I hope you will forgive me
For whenever I capsize
I know that you can see it in my eyes
I'm not myself right now
My biggest problem is to compromise
But I'm sure I would know how
I show my tragedy with my black eye
I've been the one to deny
Everything that you do
I said it's all a big lie
Always questioning you
Even though you've been true
And I know that I've been nothing more
Than just a jealous guy
But everybody's talking about you
All the time about things you do
And that's the only time I do realize
That I do love being close to you
And everybody's laughing with you
Guess that's the thing that I just can't stand
I'm selfish more than I am a manSee Millencolin LiveGet tickets as low as $117You might also likeEmbed
