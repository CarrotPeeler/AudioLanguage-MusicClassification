It's so important to make someone happy
Make just one someone happy
Make just one heart to heart you, you sing to
One smile that cheers you
One face that lights when it nears you
One girl you're, you're everything to

Fame, if you win it
Comes and goes in a minutes
Where's the real stuff in life, to cling to?
Love is the answer
Someone to love is the answer
Once you've found her
Build your world around her

Make someone happy
Make just one someone happy
And you will be happy too
(And you will be happy too)You might also likeEmbed
