2 ContributorsSince Youâ€™ve Been Gone LyricsI get the same old dream, same time every night
Fall to the ground and I wake up
So I get out of bed, put on my shoes and in my head
Thoughts fly back to the break-up
These four walls are closing in
Look at the fix you've put me in
Since you've been gone, since you've been gone
I'm outta my head, can't take it
Could I be wrong? But since you've been gone
You've cast the spell, so break it
Oh, oh, oh, since you've been gone
So in the night I stand beneath the backstreet light
I read the words that you sent to me
I can take the afternoon but night-time comes around too soon
You can't know what you mean to me
Your telegram
Just goes to show you don't give a damn
Since you've been gone, since you've been gone
I'm outta my head, can't take it
Could I be wrong? But since you've been gone
You've cast the spell, so break it
Oh, oh, oh, since you've been gone
You might also likeNow if you will come back
Baby, then you'll never do wrong
Since you've been gone, since you've been gone
I'm outta my head, can't take it
Could I be wrong? But since you've been gone
You've cast the spell, so break it
Oh, oh, oh, oh, ever since you've been gone
Oh, oh, oh, oh, ever since you've been goneEmbed
