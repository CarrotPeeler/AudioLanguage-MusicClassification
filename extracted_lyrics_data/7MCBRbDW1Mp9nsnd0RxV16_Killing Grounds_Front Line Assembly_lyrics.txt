You, do it again
You, yes you
You, do it again
Whispers in my ear, perverted thoughts I hear
Bondage and isolation, final destination
Depth charge
Depth charge
Depth charge
You, yes you
You, do it again
You, yes you
You, do it again
Weapons of pleasure, weapons of pain
A torment scarfication, a conscious of shame
You, yes you
You, do it again
You, yes you
You, do it again
Depth charge
