2 ContributorsPerception (Infekktion Mix) LyricsNothing ever stays the way that you want
It's falling apart, in doubt, I've lost my way
A focal point to project these words of silence gone insane
Spiritual defect, my system rejects your emotional display
Nothing stays the same (let me out)
Don't talk to me of psychic ability
You can't see my future when you hide underneath a sky so bright
It's blinding me to open up my eyes
And if these lies were true, why would it matter to you?
Don't believe in anything that you can't see
Extrasensory, in your pеrception of me
Nothing evеr stays the way that you want
It's falling apart, in doubt, I've lost my way
A focal point to project these words of silence gone insane
Spiritual defect, my system rejects your emotional display
Nothing stays the same (let me out)
Let me out
Don't talk to me of psychic ability
You can't see my future when you hide underneath a sky so bright
It's blinding me to open up my eyes
And if these lies were true, why would it matter to you?
Don't believe in anything that you can't see
Extrasensory, in your perception of me
