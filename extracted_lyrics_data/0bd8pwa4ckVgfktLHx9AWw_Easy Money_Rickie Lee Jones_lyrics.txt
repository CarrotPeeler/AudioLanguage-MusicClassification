4 ContributorsEasy Money Lyrics
There was a Joe
Oh, leanin' on the back door
A couple Jills
That had their eyes on a couple bills
Their eyes was statin', they was waitin'
To get their hands on some easy money

They flipped a dime
One says, "Well, I'll take heads this time"
One stepped up, one stepped back
One loosened her shoulder strap
She couldn't speak, her knees got weak
Oh, she could almost taste it, easy money

There was this old black cat
Who was sittin' in a old black Cadillac
And the Joe smelled sweet
So she curls up at her boyfriend's feet
She says, "I got a plan, listen, Sam
How'd ya like to make some of that easy money?"

Oh, he say, "Yes! Oh, yes!
Just tell me what you want me to do"
She says, "Baby, you can trust me
Oh baby, but you must be
Hidin' in my room at a quarter to two"

Well, the cat told the boy
"Come up to the room and play with my toys, honey"
But the Jill set the bait
And she wasn't gonna sit around and wait
But this guy was wise to all of the lies
And he flies out the door with the easy money

Oh, because there ain't no man
Who got the money in his hand
Who got any of that bread
By bein' slow in the head
The easier it looks, the hotter it hooks
There ain't no such thing as easy money

We say, "Yes! Oh, yes!"

Ooh, Saturday night
There was a terrible, terrible fight
Between two dames
Who was losin' the same game
It wasn't clear but I hear
That somebody was lookin' for some easy money, yeahEmbed
