4 ContributorsBlack Hole LyricsDrinking Coca-Cola all night
Ooh, baby, I wanna get in a fight
Breaking glass bottles is oh so fun
Let's go and kill someone
Living in the city I get so bored
I wanna choke myself on a telephone cord
I guess we could go drive around
But what's the point in this town?
Always going back and forth
Ooh I'm living in a black hole
Sick of all the same lame faces
Ooh I'm stuck in a black hole
Always going back and forth
Ooh I'm living in a black hole
Tired and there's nowhere to go
Ooh I'm stuck in this black hole
Staying up till six in the morning
Trying to find something that's not boring
We can go party down the street
Let's beat those kids to the beat
Eating pizza is really great
So is destroying everything you hate
I just wanna lose all control
Blow up this giant fucking hell holeYou might also likeEmbed
