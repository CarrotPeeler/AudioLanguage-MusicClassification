11 ContributorsThe Other Side Lyrics
Come on down to the other side
Come with us through the gates of hell
We will drag you from where you are
To where you belong
Come on down to the other side
Come with us through the gates of hell
We will drag you from where you are
To where you belong

There's nothing to fear
Your saviors are here
This ship is coming down
This ship is coming down
This ship is coming down
Coming down, coming down
You, you are so precious
A diamond in the rough
And when you try to escape
I'll be holding on
(Holding on, holding on, holding on...)

But I can't sleep until this is done
They're in my head, they're in my soul

Come on down to the other side
Come with us through the gates of hell
We will drag you from where you are
To where you belong
Come on down to the other side
Come with us through the gates of hell
We will drag you from where you are
To where you belong

We are in your spirit
We're everywhere you turn
From the cover to the cover
The cover to the cover
Your lover (to your brother)
To your mother (the others)
You, you are so precious (precious)
But now you've gone away
And I am falling apart
Under the waves
(The waves, the waves, the waves...)

But I can't sleep until this is done
They're in my head, they're in my soul
Through the gates of hell
We know you
This ship is coming down
This ship is coming down
Coming down
Coming down
Coming down
Coming down
Coming down
Coming down
Coming down

Down to the other side
Come with us through the gates of hell
We will drag you from where you are
To where you belong
Come on down to the other side
Come with us through the gates of hell
We will drag you from where you are
To where you belong2Embed
