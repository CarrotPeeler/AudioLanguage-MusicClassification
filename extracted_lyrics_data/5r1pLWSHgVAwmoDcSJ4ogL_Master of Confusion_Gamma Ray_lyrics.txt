3 ContributorsMaster of Confusion Lyrics
You try to call me, I'm not at home
My mobile's off, can't leave a message
And now you're waiting; still, I won't show
You won't believe what happened to me

And now I'm running like the wind (oh-oh-oh)
But I won't have much time, I'm sorry once again

No matter where I'm going
Or anywhere I roam
I am the Master of Confusion
Maybe you'll see me coming
Or maybe I just don't
I am the Master of...
Confusion

The label's calling: "Boys, are you done?
The deadline's past, time to deliver"
"I am so sorry, we're running late
Some unexpected ghost in the machinery"
You might also like
Again, I'm running like the wind (ooh-oh-oh)
Now all the made-up plans are running out of hand

No matter where I'm going
Or anywhere I roam
I am the Master of Confusion
Maybe you'll see me coming
Or maybe I just don't
I am the Master of...
Confusion
(Confusion)

I am chaos, I'm disaster, I am pain
Sweet disorder, anarchy, go insane
(Go insane)


Whenever I am closing in (oh-oh-oh)
Your peaceful life goes in the bin
Let chaos begin
No matter where we're going
Or anywhere we roam
We are the Masters of Confusion
We'll take your life apart
And we don't give a damn
We are the Masters of...

No matter where we're going
Or anywhere we roam
We are the Masters of Confusion
We're like an open fire, a raging thunderstorm
We are the Masters of Confusion
Masters of Confusion

Masters of Confusion
Masters of Confusion
Masters of Confusion
Masters of Confusion
Masters of... Masters of...
Masters of Confusion
(Confusion, Confusion, Confusion...)
Confusing youEmbed
