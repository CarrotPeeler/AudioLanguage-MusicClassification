8 ContributorsLong Black Limousine Lyrics
There's a long line of mourners driving down our little street, their fancy cars are such a sight to see, oh, yeah
They're all of your rich friends who knew you in the city and now they've finally brought you, brought you home to me

When you left, you know you told me that someday you'd be returning in a fancy car all the town to see, oh, yeah
Well, now everyone is watching you, you finally had your dream, yeah, and you're riding in a long black limousine

You know the papers told of how you lost your life, oh, yeah
The party, the party and the fatal crash that night
Well, the race upon the highway, oh, the curve you didn't see
Well, you're riding in that long black limousine

Through tear filled eyes, I watch as you ride by, oh, yeah
A chauffeur, a chauffeur at the wheel dressed up so fine
Well, I'll never, I'll never love another, oh, my heart, all my dreams
Yeah, they're with you in that long black limousine

Yeah, yeah, they're with you in that long black limousine
Yeah, yeah, yeah, they're with you in that long black limousine
Yeah, yeah, they're with you in that long black limousine
Yeah, yeah, yeah, they're with you in that long black limousine
Oh, yeah, they're with you in that long black limousineYou might also likeEmbed
