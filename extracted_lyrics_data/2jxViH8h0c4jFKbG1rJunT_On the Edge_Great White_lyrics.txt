3 ContributorsOn the Edge LyricsI been hanging my life on a frayed tight wire
I been walking thin ice with my heels on fire
I keep racing my heart so the beat won't miss me
I'm still wanting a night when the stars will kiss me
I got too much time
I don't know who's alive
I'm never satisfied
Living on the edge, the edge of time
Waiting for a perfect crime
On the edge, the edge of time
Living
Everyone I see has got the cool cold shoulder
Just hanging around getting slow and older
Like a little girl sucking chemical cola
She's strung out on lies that the TV sold her
I got too much time
I don't know who's alive
I'm never satisfied
Living on the edge, the edge of time
Waiting for a perfect crime
On the edge, the edge of time
Living on the edge, the edge of time
Waiting for a perfect crime
On the edge, the edge of time
Living on the edge

I don't know who's alive
I'm never satisfied
Living on the edge, the edge of time
Waiting for a perfect crime
On the edge, the edge of time
Living on the edge, the edge of time
Waiting for a perfect crime
On the edge, the edge of time
Living on the edgeEmbed
