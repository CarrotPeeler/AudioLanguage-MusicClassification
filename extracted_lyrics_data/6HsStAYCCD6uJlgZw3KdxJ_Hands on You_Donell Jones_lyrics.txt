2 ContributorsHands On You Lyrics
You been lookin', so damn good and, sexy, girl, you know it (Know it)
Ain't no tellin', what's gonna happen, if you let me on it (On it)
I can feel you, girl, I feel you, if you get to know me (Know me)
Ain't no talkin', I'm bout knockin', I know that you're bout it, too
Baby, it's bout good

Can I put my hands on you? (OH!)
And you put your hands on me (Put your hands on me)
Despite the fact that we just met, I know I can make you believe
If I put my hands on you (OH!)
And you put your hands on me
I see myself getting up under your dress
And then they gon' ask us to leave
Leave, leave, leave
Can I put my hands on you? (You touch me)
I know what you wanna do (Do with me)
If I put my hands on you
I can make you sweat
Touch me while you sweat for me

Cameras watchin', while I'm touchin', everybody's starin' (Starin')
You undressin', got those dressin', and I'm not even carin', (Carin')
You can't tell me, you don't feel me
It's not what your body's sayin' (Sayin')
One more drink and, you'll be thinking
Come on, babe, stop playin', put it on me
You might also like
Can I put my hands on you? (OH!)
And you put your hands on me (Put it on me)
Despite the fact that we just met, I know I can make you believe
If I put my hands on you (OH!)
And you put your hands on me (On me)
I see myself getting up under your dress
And then they gon' ask us to leave
Leave, leave, leave (Oh baby)
Can I put my hands on you? (You touch me)
I know what you wanna do (Do with me)
If I put my hands on you, oh (OH!)

I bet you I can make you call me, baby (Can I put my hands on you?)
Lean you up against the wall and drive you crazy
(And you put your hands on me)
I wonder if the way you dance, is like the way you are in bed
'Cause if so, I know I got to get that fast, get that fast, oh

Can I put my hands on you? (OH!)
And you put your hands on me (Put 'em on me)
Despite the fact that we just met, I know I can make you believe
If I put my hands on you (OH!)
And you put your hands on me
I see myself getting up under your dress
And then they gon' ask us to leave
Leave, leave, leave
Can I put my hands on you? (You touch me)
I know what you wanna do (Do with me)
If I put my hands on you, ohEmbed
