1 ContributorFlag LyricsTake that noise out in the street
This rubble out from under my feet
No rest for the weary in here
And make a fuss, you're a volunteer
These days, they lord above me
Growing mean as they grow shorter
Like a flag on a closing border now...
Closing right behind you
In a crowd down off the hill
Full of bloodlust and good will
We carried pride above our heads
Like a flag we could cheer to wake the dead
And when we could go no further
And were drowning on a desert
We raised our flag to follow the breath of God...
But it was blowing every which way
I loved you long before I knew
Love is something one decides to do
My vanity and fear conspired belief
That love's just a mirror for a thief
So when you held me tight against you
And I mistook your heart for thunder
And like a flag, hid behind and under you...
Who could blame me?
You might also like(When you held me tight against you
And I mistook your heart for thunder
Like a flag, I hid behind it
Like a flag, Iâ€™m hiding under you)
Now I hang my clothes out to dry
Like waves of surrender, they fly
The whore of this world looks old and played
Still she peeks from the alley
Like a waiting bride's maid
Laugh or bleed as you need to
Who of us doesn't know already?
Every flag flies like confetti now...Embed
