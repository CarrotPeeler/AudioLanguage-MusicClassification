3 ContributorsPrettiest Boy LyricsOut of my window I see such a sight
I am watching someone who might see me
He might look at me with those eyes
And then look in once more
Beauty like nothing that I've seen before
He looks like a girl but I know he's a boy
Pretty long eyelashes
I have a pineapple crush on a boy, I don't know
Where he came from or how he got skin just like snow
He's the angel I asked for in my prayers last night
He's the only one who can make my wrong life right
'Cause I know he was sent here
Just for me
Beautiful vision is stuck in my heart
I wish I could tell him but don't know where to start
I will remember that face in my mind
Not like another that I will ever find
Watching him drink from his bottle
I'll keep that bottle forever
Pineapple crush and a boy, I don't know
Where he came from or how come his angel eyes glow
He's the vision that I saw in my dream last night
He's the only one who can make my wrong life right
I know that he sat there
Just for me
I know that he sat there
Just to be with meYou might also like1Embed
