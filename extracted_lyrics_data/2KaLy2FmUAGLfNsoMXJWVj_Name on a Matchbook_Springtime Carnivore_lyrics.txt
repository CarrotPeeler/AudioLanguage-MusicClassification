3 ContributorsName on a Matchbook Lyrics

So long, so long
Until you prove me wrong
So long, so long
Until you prove me wrong

Stranger to me now, coming too close
Coming too close for comfort
When the sun went down
Midnight pass on the air
I sounded so sure, maybe in another life
Maybe at another time
Have you met me somewhere before
I wonder as I shut the door

So long, so long
Until you prove me wrong
So long, so long
Until you prove me wrong
I got your name on a matchbook
I'll leave your things in the past
So long, so long
Until you prove me wrong
You might also like
I leave your books unread
Your mouth un-kissed
Your bed can stay unmade
I've stepped too easily
Into a possibility
Is it wrong that I want more?
I wonder as I shut the door

So long, so long
Until you prove me wrong
So long, so long
Until you prove me wrong
I got your name on a matchbook
I'll leave your things in the past
So long, so long
Until you prove me wrong



So long, so long
Until you prove me wrong
So long, so long
Until you prove me wrong
I got your name on a matchbook
I'll leave your things in the past
So long, so long
Until you prove me wrong
