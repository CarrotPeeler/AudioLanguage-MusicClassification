6 ContributorsThe Flat Earth Lyrics(Hold me, baby)
(Love me, darling)
(Believe me, darling)
The Earth can be any shape you want it
Any shape at all
Dark and cold or bright and warm
Long or thin or small
But it's home (home, baby) and all I ever had
And maybe why for me the Earth is flat
Friends have often asked me why
I'm sensitive about my height
I will look around and say
Hmm, I thought I was immune
All my life I have waited
To be given any word
It was screaming to be heard
Please remember
(Hold me, baby)
(Love me, darling)
(Believe me, darling)
The Earth can be any shape you want it
Any shape at all
Dark and cold or bright and warm
Long or thin or small
But it's home (home, baby) and all I ever had
And maybe why for me the Earth is flat

Ooh, turn it
Then when they spill the demon seed
Turn and face into the wind
All along you still believed
Believed you were immune
And if love is all you're missing
Look into your heart
Is anybody home?
Please remember
(Hold me, baby)
(Love me, darling)
(Believe me, darling)
The Earth can be any shape you want it
Any in the world
But don't you point that ray gun at me
I might just explode
There are stones (home, baby) buried in your soul
And only a fool would blame the death of rock and roll
And in time (time, baby) you'll come to understand
This flat old Earth is in your gentle hands1Embed
