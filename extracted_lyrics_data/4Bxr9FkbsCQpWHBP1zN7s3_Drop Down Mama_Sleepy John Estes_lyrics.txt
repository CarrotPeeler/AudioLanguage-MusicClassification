2 ContributorsDrop Down Mama LyricsNow, drop down, baby, let your daddy be
I know just what you're tryin’ to pull on me
Well my mama, she don't allow me to fool 'round all night long
Now I may look like I’m crazy, poor John do know right from wrong
Go 'way from my window quit scratchin' on my screen
You's a dirty mistreater I know just what you mean
Well my mama, she don't allow me to fool 'round all night long
Now I may look like I'm crazy, poor John do know right from wrong
Some of these women sure do make me tired
Got a, a handful of "Gimme", a mouthful of "Much obliged"
Well my mama, she don't allow me to fool ’round all night long
Now I may look like I’m crazy, poor John do know right from wrong
Woman I'm lovin’, one teeth solid gold
That's the onliest woman a mortgage on my soul
Well my mama, she don't allow me to fool 'round all night long
Now I may look like I’m crazy, poor John do know right from wrong
See me comin' put your man outdoors
You know I ain't no stranger I done been here before
Well my mama, she don't allow me to fool 'round all night long
Now I may look like I'm crazy, poor John do know right from wrongYou might also likeEmbed
