2 ContributorsRain LyricsDust and wind and heat
Since 14 days in the murdering sun of the Sierra Nevada
No rain, no water, no food
We are prisoners in the melting pot of hell
Oh God, help us!
Rain, rain, rain
Sierra Nevada
Sierra Nevada
Sierra Nevada
We're standing here and give our lives in your hand
For just one drop of rain we beg you to send
Why don't you hear our prayer
Should it be all over now?
No longer we can stay
Not more that we can say
The monotonous storm only blows
Rain, rain, rain - Sierra Nevada
Sierra Nevada
Rain, rain, rain - Sierra Nevada
Sierra Nevada
Rain, rain, rain
Sierra Nevada
Sierra Nevada
Sierra Nevada
Sierra Nevada

A million stars in the sky
The fire we sit all around will surely die
The hopes and the dreams will finally been gone with the wind
Another day of fear
Another night of tears
I close my eyes and start to dream
Rain, rain, rain - Sierra Nevada
Sierra Nevada...
Rain
