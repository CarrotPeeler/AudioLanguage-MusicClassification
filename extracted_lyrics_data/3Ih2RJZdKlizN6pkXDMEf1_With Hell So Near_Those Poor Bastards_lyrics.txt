1 ContributorWith Hell So Near LyricsGot nothin' to say for myself
I'm just a poor bastard like everyone else
Sittin' in the garage with gasoline
Huffin' fumes with my
Friends off the street
Well this here cliff looks mighty steep
Bet I could find a home
Among the ragged rocks beneath
And it’s a long way down
I've got the time
With hell so near
I'm desperate tonight
Fightin' with some guy
Who's twice my size
He's got the look of murder
In his beady empty eyes
Luckily for me I brought my knife
I stab him once
Then he smashes in my face
Well no one tries to stop my fall
I look to them
As they stand there and applaud
And it's a long way down
I’ve got the time
With hell so near
I'm desperate tonight
You might also likeEverything's divided black or white
There's good and evil
There's wrong and there’s right
I guess I know what side I'm on
When I try to do right
Others tell me I done wrong
Well this here river looks wide and deep
Bet I could find a home
Among the bones and weeds beneath
And it's a long way down
I've got the time
With hell so near
I'm desperate tonightEmbed
