If there's one thing worse than a murderer, it's a dirty, rotten, stinking grass. And that goes for litterbugs as well. Ta-ra...

We'll get ya, ya, ya
We'll get ya, ya, ya
I am Michael Caine

He's walking – where? I'm afraid I don't know
I see the firemen jumping from the windows
There's panic and I hear somebody scream (Aah!)

He picks up useless paper and puts it in my pocket
I'm trying very hard to keep my fingers clean
I can't remember, tell me – what's his name?
My name is Michael Caine

And all I wanted was a word
Or photograph to keep at home
And all I wanted was a word
Or photograph to keep

The sun is laughing, it's another broken morning
I see a shadow and call out to try and warn him
He didn't seem to hear, just turned away
You might also like
The quiet fellow follows, points his fingers straight at you
He had to sacrifice his pride, yes
Throw it all away

I am Michael Caine

And all I wanted was a word
Or photograph to keep at home
And all I wanted was a word
Or photograph to keep

His days are numbered, he walks round and round in circles
There is no place he can ever call his own
He seems to jump at the sound of the phone

Staring out the window, there's nothing he can now do
All he wanted was to remain sane
He can't remember his own name
My name is Michael Caine

And all I wanted was a word
Or photograph to keep at home
And all I wanted was a word
Or photograph to keep
And all I wanted was a word
Or photograph to keep at home
And all I wanted was a word
Or photograph to keep
And all I wanted was a word
Or photograph to keep at home
And all I wanted was a word
Or photograph to keep
And all I wanted was a word
Or photograph to keep at home
And all I wanted was a word
I think we got it there, don't you?Embed
