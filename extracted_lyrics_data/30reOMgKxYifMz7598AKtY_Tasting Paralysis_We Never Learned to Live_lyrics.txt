1 ContributorTasting Paralysis LyricsYou and I were made to need oxygen
Apnea projections out of reach
You and I were made to need oxygen
Paranoid conscience replaced you with machine
Punctures in the sky are twitching and fading away
Satellites hypnotised you into a daydream
Made to need oxygen, we're all afraid to sleep
And I said "Don’t hold your breath
Don't get comfortable, we're all afraid to sleep."
Emptying translucency temporarily as
It seems to cloak the anxieties beneath
I’ve been muting these twisted lucid dreams and
I tried to paint the worlds pale
Don't get comfortable
We're barely here
We're all afraid to sleepYou might also likeEmbed
