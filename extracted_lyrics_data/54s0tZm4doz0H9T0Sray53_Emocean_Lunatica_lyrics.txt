The tide is like the heartbeat of eternity
I feel warm and safe as I'm diving deeper
Into the heart of the ocean, I have no fear

Beauty and wisdom are surrounding me here
Aren't we the ones who try to ignore?

Why I've never felt like this before?
Oh, I cannot say!
It is pulling me deeper
It feels like going home to my fathers
I feel like a child in this deep blue wilderness
♪ 
What I used to be is not important
I feel that something has changed inside myself
I breathe easily inside this liquid life
A total synthesis, immortality

Forever free is what I could be if I stayed here
With no idea of human greed I would play my part
I escape from everything that I know
As I'm drifting within this flow
Let me go to where I belong!
Listen to the waves—they're singing our song
