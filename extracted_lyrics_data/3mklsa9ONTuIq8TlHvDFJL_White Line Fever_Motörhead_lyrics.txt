Will you move along now
While the going's good
But  you wouldn't come with me, baby
Even if you could

White line fever made me a believer now
White line fever, yeah
Take me away from you

Just come to me babe
We can stay right here
But you don't remember me, honey
'Cause I won't be back this year

White line fever, we're gonna make you a dreamer
White line fever, yeah
It's a slow death

Hey

Bye, bye, bye baby
'Cause there I come
Won't go to sleep tonight
Because the white line turns me on
You might also like
White line fever made me a believer
White line fever, yeah
It hasn't killed my yet
