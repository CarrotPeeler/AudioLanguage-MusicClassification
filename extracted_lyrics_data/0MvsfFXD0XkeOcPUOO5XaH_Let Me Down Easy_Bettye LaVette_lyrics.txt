4 ContributorsLet Me Down Easy LyricsLet me down easy though your love for me is gone
Let me down easy since you feel to stay is wrong
I know it's all over but the last goodbye
Let me down easy
When you pass me by, say hello once in a while
When you pass me by, baby, does it hurt so much to smile?
We promised that we'd still be friends till the very end
I'm begging you, baby, please, let me down easy
I remember at the start, it was so nice
I never thought we'd have to part
But it's all over but the last goodbye
Let me down easy, baby
Hum hum hum hum, let me down so easy baby
Let me down so easy baby
Let me down down down down, let me down so easy baby, oh oh oh
I don't want anyone of your love, baby, let me down down, let me down so easy
Baby, oh oh, let me down so easyYou might also likeEmbed
