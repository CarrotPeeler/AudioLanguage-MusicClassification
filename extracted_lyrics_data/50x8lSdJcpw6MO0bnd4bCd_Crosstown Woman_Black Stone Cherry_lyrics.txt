2 ContributorsCrosstown Woman LyricsI am just a man of blood and bone
And simple means
That old bossman works my body long and hard
But on the weekends you know I'm free
Got me a crosstown woman
Got me under her spell
Got me a crosstown woman
She's like my heaven with a whole lot of hell
I have seen the girls of New York City
And the Frisco bay
But there ain't no woman on this earth, make me
Feel her voodoo
Quite the same
Got me a crosstown woman
Got me under her spell
Got me a crosstown woman
She's like my heaven with a whole lot of hell
Woo ooh woo ooh
Woo ooh woo ooh woman
Woo ooh woo ooh
Woo ooh crosstown woman
You might also likeGot me a crosstown woman
Got me under her spell
Got me a crosstown woman
She's like my heaven with a whole lot of hell
She's my Crosstown WomanEmbed
