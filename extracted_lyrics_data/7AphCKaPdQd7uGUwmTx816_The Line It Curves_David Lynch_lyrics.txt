3 ContributorsThe Line It Curves LyricsGoin' out
Get in my car
The way you've been treatin' me baby
Ain't comin' back your way
Savin' my money
For a rainy day
It's rainy, baby
The line it curves
A certain way
Bend back to the start
'cause you're the woman
Who broke my heart
I just won't be comin' home today
Or tomorrow either, baby
Goin' out
In my car
The way you've been treatin' me baby
Ain't comin' back your way
The line it curves
A certain way
Bend back to the start
'cause you're the woman
Who broke my heart
'cause you're the only one
That can mend this heart
You might also likeThe line it curves
A certain way
Bend back to the start
'cause you're the woman
Who broke my heart
'cause you're the only one
That can mend this heart
'cause you're the only one
That can mend this heartEmbed
