7 ContributorsPersistence (Demo) Lyrics
Settle down, stop trying so hard
Push back what you think is impossible
You're only undecided
Because you chose to be

Settle down, don't take it personal
Rearrange how you see things
You're only undecided
Because you were told to be
Because you were told to be

Go ahead and find yourself
Undeniably different
Go ahead and clear the way
Your only thought is persistence
Your only thought is persistence

Take your time, stop thinking so much
Always searching for answers
You're only uninspired
Because you chose to be

Take your time, don't try and force it out
Your opinions can sometimes be self doubt
You're only uninspired
Because of what you've seen
Because of what you've seen

Go ahead and find yourself
Undeniably different
Go ahead and clear the way
Your only thought is persistence
Go ahead and find yourself
Undeniably different
Go ahead and clear the way
Your only thought is persistence
Your only thought is persistence

And maybe it's not your fault at all
Anyone can make mistakes
But can all wrongs be erased?
Your only thought is persistence
Go ahead and find yourself
Undeniably different
Go ahead and clear the way
Your only thought is persistence
Your only thought is persistence
Your only thought is persistenceEmbed
