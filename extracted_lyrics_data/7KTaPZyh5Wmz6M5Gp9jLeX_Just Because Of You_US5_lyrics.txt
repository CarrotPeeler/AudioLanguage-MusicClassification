7 ContributorsJust Because Of You Lyrics
Just because of you, I'm cryin in sadness
Just because of us, I feel like I'm dyin
So I'm beggin you, wantin you, callin you

I never believed our love would die
It's funny how time just passed us by
I couldn't imagine you'd walk out my life
And all of the girls that I once knew
They all disappeared when I met you
You're all that I ever wanted in my life

I'll find a way to make you stay, I still believe in our love
I see the truth, because of you, the key to our lasting love
(I don’t want mess in love, oh babe)

Just because of you, I'm cryin in sadness
Give it one more try, and I'll do the same
Just because of us, I feel like I'm dyin
So I'm beggin' you, wantin' you, callin' you

I never believed a man should cry
Until you got up, and said goodbye
I pray for the day, you'll come back in my life
I'd do anything to make this right
If only I had you by my side
I'm thinking about you baby day and night
You might also like
I'll find a way to make you stay, I still believe in our love
I see the truth, because of you, the key to our lasting love
(I don’t want mess in love, oh babe)

Just because of you, I'm cryin in sadness
Give it one more try, and I'll do the same
Just because of us, I feel like I'm dyin
So I'm beggin' you, wantin' you, callin' you
Just because of you, I'm cryin in sadness
Give it one more try, and I'll do the same
Just because of us, I feel like I'm dyin
So I'm beggin' you, wantin' you, callin' you

Just because of you
Just because of us

Just because of you, I'm cryin in sadness
Give it one more try, and I'll do the same
Just because of us, I feel like I'm dyin
So I'm beggin' you, wantin' you, callin' youEmbed
