"Freedom," this cry of all slaves will be heard
And the tyrants will feel the steel of the sword
The chains will be broken by all slaves on the earth
Forever to be free from their load

Time has run out for all you tyrants on earth
Your slaves are heedin' the call
Makin' an end to all this terror and pain
An end to your lies and your law

Takin' away all your gold and your money
'Cause dead men don't need it anymore
Much too long, we felt the slash of your whips
So now you will feel our swords

"Freedom," the eternal cry will echo high in the sky
The day will come when all power has been broken
Your blood will flow down to the gates of hell
Satan will wait for your souls
Pray to your god, he won't help you; he's dead
He won't fool our minds and our souls... anymore
