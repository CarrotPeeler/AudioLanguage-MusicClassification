2 ContributorsCut-Throat Urges LyricsNot so long ago, on a cold december day
You let my father die in solitude and pain
Once he was your son, and baptised in your name
If this is now you treat him, then violence is my way
Cut-throat urges
I need to spill some holy blood
Beautiful words, but hollow promises
The goodness of god is a fucking joke
Get out of your heavenly palace
And show your real face
How can people believe in this shit
How can they be so naive
Not so long ago, on a cold december day
You took all hope in my life away
Once I had respect, and hallowed was your name
If this is how you treat me, then violence is my wayYou might also likeEmbed
