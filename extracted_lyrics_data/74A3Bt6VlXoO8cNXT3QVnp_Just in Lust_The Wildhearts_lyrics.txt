2 ContributorsJust In Lust LyricsHow you been? It's been a while
I heard you found someone to make you smile
Stick around, you got a pen?
It's just so great to see your face again
And take a chair, pull up a glass
Do you remember when I saw you last?
Things have changed with no regret
I'm glad we've got to share a little etiquette
One of these days in a classical way I was
Just in lust with you
Shutting out fire where the flame of two lie I was
Just in lust with you
And in the passion that plays in a chemical haze I was
Just in lust with you
I know you felt it too
Because I miss you, but not that much
We only shared a little human touch
Nothing wrong or impolite
You're acting like pleasure's got a copyright
S-s-s-s-so backtrack, get the record straight
We only had a day to intimate
No one signed on the dotted line
We never said there'd ever be a second time
You might also likeOne of these days in a classical way I was
Just in lust with you
Shutting out fire where the flame of two lie I was
Just in lust with you
And in the passion that plays in a chemical haze I was
Just in lust with you
You know I felt it too
So why the worry? So why the guilt?
So why deny a night under the quilt?
So we were lonely, so we agree
We only did it for the company
Things is wrong and things is right
Things got a way of changing overnight
What's so wrong in turning on?
Instead of being alone when the chances are gone
'Cause it was one of these days in a classical way I was
Just in lust with you
Shutting out fire where the flame of two lie I was
Just in lust with you
And in the passion that plays in a chemical haze I was
Just in lust with you
You know, 'cause you
You felt it too1Embed
