11 ContributorsLiarâ€™s Love LyricsLosing trust in human touch
It's honest like a liar's love
Disappear as hands draw near
Avoid the longing sense of being one you trust
Don't count on me
I'm not what you need
Ostracized, a loss of pride
There's only shadows on my side
Lessons learned: no one's concern
Lends itself to wounds that won't
Repair with time
Don't count on me
I'm not what you need
Temporary but can't be erased
Pushed away to a darker placeYou might also like3Embed
