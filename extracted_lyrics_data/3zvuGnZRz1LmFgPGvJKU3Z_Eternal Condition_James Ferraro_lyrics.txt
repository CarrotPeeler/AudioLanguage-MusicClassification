Did you wish yourself away
And you know you had your play
And you know your self away
Time is only standing, standing still
Made yourself knowing that you'll break
Did you wish yourself, don't know where
Time is slow, time is slow
Bet you know, bet you know
Let her know, let her know
Time is slow, and I felt
Time is slow, and now I know
Yeah, yeah
Did you notice anyway
Did yourself a lonely way
Time is looping on anyway
Time is moving on anyway
Time to lose yourself away
La da da da, la da da da
La da da da, la da da da
