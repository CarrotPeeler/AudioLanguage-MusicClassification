5 ContributorsStreets of Arklow Lyrics
And as we walked through the streets of Arklow
Oh, the color of the day wore on
And our heads were filled with poetry
In the morning a-comin' on to dawn

And as we walked through the streets of Arklow
In gay profusion in God's green land
And the gypsies rode with their hearts on fire
They say, "We love to wander
Lord, we love, Lord, we love to roam"

And as we walked through the streets of Arklow
In its raging beauty, yeah, rollin' back to the day
And I saw your eyes, they was shinin', sparklin' crystal clear
And our souls were clean and the grass did grow
And our souls were clean and the grass did grow
And our souls were clean and the grass did grow

And as we walked through the streets of ArklowYou might also likeEmbed
