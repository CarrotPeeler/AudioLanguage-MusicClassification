1 ContributorQuiet and Small LyricsShe's very quiet and very small
In fact, she's hardly there at all
That's what she is
And what she is
And what she is
I watched her climbing up a tree
And at the top she waved to me
That's what she did
And what she did
And what she did
La da da da da da da da
La da da da da da da da da
Tonight before I fell asleep
I gave her all my songs to keep
That's what I did
And what I did
And what I did
I dreamed of climbing up a tree
And at the top she waved to me
That's how she is
And how she is
And how she is

La da da da da da da da da
She's the smallest of all persons
Mentioned in the records of littleness
All but one
She's the smallest but one;
She's only wee
La da da da da da da da
La da da da da da da da daEmbed
