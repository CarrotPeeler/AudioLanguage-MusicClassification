Trouble sleeping (trouble)
Dreaming of you
Trouble speaking (trouble)
Thinking of you
Something strange has happened
I just can't get myself, together
No kind of way, for you

Must have put a spell on my mind
You must have put a spell on my mind
And turned me around

Trouble seeing (trouble)
Visions of you
Trouble thinking (trouble)
Control my will to
Take a bow if you want to, I still can't
Get myself together
No kind of way, for you

Must have put a spell on my mind, (oh spell)
Must have put a spell on my mind
You might also like
You made a new man of me, now I feel heavenly for you

Must have a put a spell on my mind (Must have put a spell on my mind)
(I'm under your power baby, oh, spell)
Must have a put a spell on my mind (Must have put a spell on my mind)
(I'm under your power baby, oh, spell)
Must have a put a spell on my mind (Must have put a spell on my mind)

You see, I gave you everything I had
But you just pushed me away
I tried so hard to break loose
But you gained control everyday (Spell on my mind)
I watched you take my whole world from me
And there was nothing I could do
A secret word, a hidden touch
And I belonged to you
Spell

Must have a put a spell on my mind (I'm under your power baby, oh, spell)
Must have a put a spell on my mind (I'm under your power baby, oh, spell)
Must have a put a spell on my mind
Must have a put a spell on my mind (I'm under your power baby, oh, spell)
You must have a put a spell on my mindEmbed
