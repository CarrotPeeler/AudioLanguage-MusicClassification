1 ContributorFalse Affection, False Creation LyricsVicious words and false belief
Chains around my wrists
A sad sensation
The craving for life is gone
Intoxicate me in the draught of life
A yelling laugh decays my dream
A laugh to fear my deed
A false affection, a false creation
Suspicious eyes enslaved within
Imprisoned - shame and guilt
But still a child
Confessing all my sins
Elaborated, but still out of reach
My hands still shiver
My eyes don't move
A deed you can't neglect
A false affection, a false creationYou might also likeEmbed
