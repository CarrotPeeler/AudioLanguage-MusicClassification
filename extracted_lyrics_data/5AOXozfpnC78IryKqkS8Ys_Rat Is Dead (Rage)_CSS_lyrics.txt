6 ContributorsRat Is Dead (Rage) LyricsUp the stairs
Behind the door
She was sitting there crying
She smashed all the glasses on the mirror
Which was shattered all across the room
She screamed so loud
Until she was laughing
Well now there's no more reasons for her to cry
It was so late it was 4AM
I know, I know, I know, I know
He will never hurt you again
I know, I know, I know, I know
He will never hurt you again
Up the stairs
By the bed
There was a dead man waiting
Waiting for someone to find him out
And bury him deep down the ground
He looked so scared
But not regretful
In the other side of town a car drives fast
Hard to tell fear from happiness
I know, I know, I know, I know
He will never hurt you again
I know, I know, I know, I know
He will never hurt you again

The rat is dead
The rat is dead
The rat is dead
Up the stairs
Behind the door
She was sitting there crying
She smashed all the glasses on the mirror
Which was shattered all across the room
She screamed so loud
Until she was laughing
Well now there's no more reasons for her to cry
It was so late it was 4AM
I know, I know, I know, I know
He will never hurt you again
I know, I know, I know, I know
He will never hurt you again
I know, I know, I know, I know
He will never hurt you again
I know, I know, I know, I know
He will never hurt you againEmbed
