Celebrate - never run away
Celebrate - wake up it's not a dream
Celebrate - this life is for free
Don't give up, stay alive
Let's celebrate
Don't give up, all your dreams come true
Let's celebrate
Can you see all this people walking through the streets of life
Without a smile in their faces how can they survive ?
It's a dangerous world they are living in
Between imagination and expectations
On their way to the point of no return
They only live once and they have to learn
Your life is too brief to waste your time for hate
It's never too late to celebrate
Celebrate - every night and day
Celebrate - never run away
Celebrate - wake up it's not a dream
Celebrate - this life is for free
When you've got the key to reality
Let's celebrate
All the dreams come true just for me and you
Let's celebrate

Reality - is what they're looking for
Love - is what they all adore
Feel like a bird in a cage
Covered by your curtain, flying into a rage
Reaching the point of no return let it burn, let it burn
They only live once and they have to learn
Your life is too brief to waste your time for hate
It's never too late to celebrate
Celebrate - every night and day
Celebrate - never run away
Celebrate - wake up it's not a dream
Celebrate - this life is for free
When you've got the key to reality
Let's celebrate
All the dreams come true just for me and you
Let's celebrate
Be yourself and you'll see
The best things in your life are free
Don't give up, stay alive
Honesty can make you survive
Celebrate, celebrate
Celebrate - every night and day
Celebrate - never run away
Celebrate - wake up it's not a dream
Celebrate - this life is for free
When you've got the key to reality
Let's celebrate
All the dreams come true just for me and you
