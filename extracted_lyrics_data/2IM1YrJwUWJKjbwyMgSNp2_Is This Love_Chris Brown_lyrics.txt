8 ContributorsIs This Love? Lyrics
Seventeen, tight jeans and she 'bout it
Wife beater tee, pretty teeth, yeah, she got 'em
Her body commands your attention
She keeps it so gutta, man
Can I take you out? I'll pay for it
Girl, I got enough, so enjoy it
I'm hoping that your momma don't mind
'Cause girl, I gotta make you mine, yeah
Ooh, girl, give me a chance, I'ma take it
Ooh, yeah, I know I'm young but I'll take it (Ooh)
I just gotta know, yeah

Is this love?
'Cause I gotta know, is this real?
Girl, I gotta know
Is it you taking over my heart?
If it's love
Then all my girls and them, I gotta give them up (If it's love)
My playing days is over, I gotta hang it up
I gotta know, I gotta know, yeah
Is this love?

If she gotta man, I don't care 'cause I need her
I got a girl, but if she want, I'ma leave her
She can be the girl that I'm putting on
We keep it so gutta, man
Ooh, I'ma be that ***** that'll change her
Ooh, make that other dude like a stranger (Ooh)
I just gotta know, tell me

I ain't been doing much sleeping, just daydreaming
'Cause she's all up in my head and I can't take it
I ain't never, ever felt like this
