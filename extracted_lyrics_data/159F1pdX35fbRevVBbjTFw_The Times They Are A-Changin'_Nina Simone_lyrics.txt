7 ContributorsThe Times They Are A-Changinâ€™ LyricsCome gather 'round people
Wherever you roam
And admit that the waters
Above you have grown
And accept it that soon
You'll be drenched to the bone
If your time to you
Is worth savin'
Then you better start swimmin'
Or you'll sink like a stone
For the times they are a-changin', changin'
Come writers and critics
Who prophesize with your pen
And keep your eyes wide
The chance won't come again
And don't speak too soon
For the wheel's still in spin
And there's no tellin' who that will be namin'
For the loser now
Will be later to win
For the times they are a-changin', changin'
Come senators and congressmen
Please heed the call
Don't stand in the doorway
Don't block up the hall
For he that gets hurt
Will be he who has stalled
There's a battle outside and it is ragin'
For wind'll soon shake your windows and rattle your walls
For the times they are a-changin', they are a-changin', Hey
You might also likeCome mothers and fathers
Throughout the land
And don't criticize
What you can't understand
For your sons and your daughters
Are beyond your command
Your old road is rapidly agin'
Please get out of the window
If you can't lend your hand
Oh the times they are a-changin', they are a-changin'
The line it is drawn
And the curse it is cast
And the slow one now
Will later be fast
As the present now
Will later be past
The order is rapidly fadin'
For the first one now
Will later be last
For the times they are a-changin', changin'Embed
