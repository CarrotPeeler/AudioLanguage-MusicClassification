9 ContributorsKiller of Giants Lyrics
If none of us believe in war
Then can you tell me what the weapon's for?
Listen to me, everyone
If the button is pushed, there'll be nowhere to run

Giant sleeping, giants winning wars within their dreams
Till they wake when it's too late and in God's name blaspheme

Killer of giants, threatens us all
Mountains of madness, standing so tall
Marches of protest, not stopping the war
Or the killer of giants, the killer of giants

Mother nature, people, state your case without its worth
Your seas run dry, your sleepless eyes are turning red alert

Killer of giants, threatens us all
Mountains of madness, standing so tall
Marches of protest, not stopping the war
This the killer of giants, this killer of giants
You might also like
Killer of giants, threatens us all
Mountains of madness, standing so tall
Marches of protest, not stopping the war
Or the killer of giants, or killer of giants
Killer of giants
Killer of giantsEmbed
