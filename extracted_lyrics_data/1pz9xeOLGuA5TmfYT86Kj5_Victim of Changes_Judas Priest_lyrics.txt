20 ContributorsVictim of Changes Lyrics
Whiskey woman don't you know that you are driving me insane
The liquor you give stems your will to live and gets right to my brain
Don't you know you're driving me insane
You're trying to find your way through life
You're trying to get some new direction
Another woman's got her man
She won't find no new connection

Takes another drink or two
Things look better when she's through

Take another look around, you're not going anywhere
You've realised you're getting old and no one seems to care
You're trying to find your way again
You're trying to get some new...
Another woman's got her man
But she won't get a new...

Takes another drink or two
Things look better when she's through

You've been foolin' with some hot guy
I want to know why is it why
Get up, get out, you know you really blew it
I've had enough, I've had enough, good god pluck me

Once she was wonderful
Once she was fine
Once she was beautiful
Once she was mine... (She was mine)
Now change has come over her body
She doesn't see me anymore
Now change has come over her body
She doesn't see me anymore
