5 ContributorsStormy Weather Lyrics
Don't know why there's no sun up in the sky stormy weather
Since my gal and I ain't together keeps raining all the time
Life is bare gloom and misery everywhere stormy weather

Just can't get my poor self together I'm weary all the time all the time
When she went away the blues walked in and met me
If she stays away old rocking chair will get me
All I do is pray the Lord above will let me walk in the sun once more
