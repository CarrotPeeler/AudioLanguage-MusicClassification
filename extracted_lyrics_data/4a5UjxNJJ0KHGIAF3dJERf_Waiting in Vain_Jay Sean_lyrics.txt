2 ContributorsWaiting In Vain LyricsFrom the very first time I rest my eyes on you boy
My heart said follow through
But I know now that I'm way down on your line
But the waiting feeling's fine
So don't treat me like a puppet on a string
Cause I know how to do my thing
Don't talk to me as if you think I'm dumb
I wanna know when your gonna come
I don't wanna wait in vain for your love
I don't wanna wait in vain for your love
I don't wanna wait in vain for your love
I don't wanna wait in vain for your love
Summer is here, I'm still waiting there
Winter is here and I'm still waiting there
Like I said
It's been three years since I've been knocking at your door
And I still can knock some more
Ooh boy, ooh boy
Is it crazy love?
For i do knock some more
You see in life I know
There's lots of grief
But your love is my relief, yeah
Tears in my eyes burn
Tears in my eyes burn
While I'm waiting, while I'm waiting for my turn, oh
I don't want to wait in vain for your love
I don't want to wait in vain for your love
I don't want to wait in vain for your love
I don't want to wait in vain for your love
You know i
You know i
I don't wanna wait in vain
No no no i you know i
I don't wanna wait in vain
It's your love that I'm waiting oh
It's my love that your running from
It's your love that I'm waiting oh
It's my love that your running from
I don't want to wait in vain for your love
I don't want to wait in vain for your love
I don't want to wait in vain for your love
I don't want to wait in vain for your loveSee Jay Sean LiveGet tickets as low as $300You might also likeEmbed
