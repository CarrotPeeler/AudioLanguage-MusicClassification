3 ContributorsThe Mycelium Resistance Lyrics
Where did it go?
Took by a man who commands on his throne
And the one thing I know
We were replaced, a disgrace to our home, so
Don't feel like it's almost over
Gotta put your
Hope into the man who can grow ya

So maybe if you join the resistance
They'll keep their distance
But we'll move along to face the district
They'll use their assistance
But we've got persistence
We will fight for our land
Make it right by demand
The resistance
Thе resistance
Move along to facе the district
The resistance
The resistance
Move along to face the district
[Verse 2}
Harvest the mycelium
It's not grass it's premium
Mooshroom there to feed us
A bowl of stew is what we trust
Make another pile or two
With the mycelium, it's what we have to do
You might also like
So maybe if you join the resistance
They'll keep their distance
But we'll move along to face the district
They'll use their assistance
But we've got persistence
We will fight for our land
Make it right by demand
The resistance
The resistance
Move along to face the district
The resistance
The resistance
Move along to face the district
The resistance
They'll keep their distance
But we'll move along to face the district
They'll use their assistance
But we've got persistence
We will fight for our land
Make it right by demand
Resistance
The resistance
Move along to face the district
The resistance
The resistance
Move along to face the districtEmbed
