Tell the truth
You know you can make me do what you want me to
Tell the truth
Tell the truth
You know you can make me do what you want me to
Loving you, feelings started
But, I'm goin' to stop it
If I could, I surely would
I would roll up around you
If I thought it would do any good
Tell the truth
Tell the truth
Well you know you can make me do what you want me to
Loving you, feelings started
But, I'm goin' to stop it
If I could, I surely would
I would roll up around you
If I thought it would do any good
