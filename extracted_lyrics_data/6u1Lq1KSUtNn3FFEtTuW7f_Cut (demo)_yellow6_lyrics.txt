13 ContributorsPLANET BEAM Lyrics

If I say I'ma ride, then they with me
Safety first, but the strap is a glizzy
We gon' circle the block and get busy (*Gunshot*)
What you talkin' 'bout? Niggas get risky
And you pussy, no, bro, he a sissy
Got hoes textin' my phone, say they miss me
Fuckers feel like we back in the sixties (*Gunshot*)

(Six)
If I say I'ma ride, then they with me
Safety first, but the strap is a glizzy
We gon' circle the block and get busy (*Gunshot*)
What you talkin' 'bout? Niggas get risky
And you pussy, no, bro, he a sissy
Niggas lyin', they say that they Richie
Got hoes textin' my phone, say they miss me (*Gunshot*)
Fuck is free like we back in the sixties
Bitches do anything for a check
I ain't tip her, man, now she upset
Tell these hoes to get sponsored by Nike (*Gunshot*)
Trust me, I know these niggas don't like me
And it's only enough when I'm dinin'
I'm a savage, we swappin', no swappin'
Swear I'm cuttin' off niggas, they dyin' (*Gunshot*)

Skip got that bounce, it go crazy

Done see you, Spanish town
Born a Saint Andrew, but I'm not a saint
Mozart inna di paint, Noah's Ark inna di rain
Come from the sky, crash down, plane

'Nuff man mi know sell Mary Jane
'Nuff man mi know able fi kill Cain
Head shot, Kurt
Cobain, follow money train
Gi' yuh gyal mi cocky, mek har levitate, David Blaine
Seems like di man tun, seems like mi brotha tun
Insane, God's name in vain
Codeine, cocaine, fuck likkle, I been Wayne
In veins, bloodstream, lion piss, domain
Seen pain, kill pain, ordained prophet
Detain, in chains, mek har ride di riddim, right brain
Get the logic from har left brain
Touch mi gyal, brush dem off
Cut dem off, against the grain
I'm a demon in a can dem cyaan contain
Front page Gleaner, Tyshane or BEAM
Or no name, pimp get yuh gyal
Put har pon street, public domain
Steady win di race, Usain Bolt
Sustain, slow bill
Slow kill, Quentin Tarantino
Did the tool inna bloody paint
Pussy look like him see a duppy when mi tek it out di case
When mi see a rat wi nuh chase
Set him up then wi skate, set him up wid a bait

And I talk 'bout Medusa, I love it
Treat that head like a turkey, I stuff it (Stuff it)
All ah di gyaldem waan fi gimme boss dome
Tek mi sword, stop eh cold
Santa know, yuh badda than a box of cigarette
Got a big choppa, heart-stopper
No manners, Big Poppa
Don Dadda in Americana
Still a wear di green and yellow, black banner
Inna uptown, have a clean face
Like di cake soap, drive down, downtown
Touch out at di party, dem a bruk down
Leave mi out di pasa, pasa, pasa
Pon di river, then mi gone, dawg
With some Rastas, with some Christians
Smokin' ganja, still Lord Jesus is my chiropractor
When mi need di healing, He my doctor, back to Earth
Call me Peter when I'm choppin' ears off
Call me Toppo, I've been sellin' pow-pow-pows
He's got a tunnel vision with no cap and gown
Me and Jeremy took it over million
This is for my jit, I put in a college fund
I'ma get that jit more than the sky and sun
Make a toast to all the assholes
Not in my prime, but I'm still in the Amazon
Body sumo wrestler, hit 'em out of bounds
When I pull up, hit to lick, Indiana Jones
She want give me kitty, baby, keep the boom
Got a wifey takin' care of tippy-tippy
Got a ballerina, always count 'em toes
I just try this first, she got me out the zone
Melody hypnotic, temptation harmonic singin' hypertonic, yeah
Back to the topic, no more pointers, I need dollars
Got a shawty, she gon' pop it, she a star like Madonna
Africana khaki, Hotel Rwanda, anaconda
Lord, forgive me, I'ma fuck the digits
No adultery, but I let the patna kiss the one that wrist is in it
I ain't do no phonics, but it's so ironic, I'm the hottest topic
My mama drop me (Mama), sicky in the heady, crack baby
Nigga psychotic, nigga Steve Jobs, nigga symphonatic
"I am such a motherfucker
But I will go fuck your mother"
Yeah, shee, yuh kiddo
Stay pon street wid God and di peace in di street
Touch road weh mi see, all di robber dem a pree
All di bees and di trees and di coolin' breeze
From creation, God in it
Life really come wid di negative and positive
Yuh see the yin-yang bling bling, chargin' it
The enemy pennin' me with the apple remedy
Yuh nuh see mi step pon di snake and get dark in it
Call fi mi, God, I'm the one, Samuel
Prophet dawg, money bag, residual, baby mom
Tek a Addy, make it go weh
Pon Addall mi cyaan fall
Now yuh pissed, get out di stall
Oh, oof, oh, oof, oh, ts, oh, ts, oh
Diligent, talkin' deals, in a Hebrew code, synagogue
Chosen one, is he real? Israel, ask God
I'm located in the sky, get off me
And my wrist, this type of life is costing me
One, zero, and below, they get frosty
They try to lock me up then make them copy
I don't need a presidential
I ain't snitchin', gettin' out like Bob D
I can pick up in the presidential car
No content, I ain't content, no, not at all
Like glue, Sean Paul, yuh see it?
She shoot di cocky, but this a nuh soca, this is dancehall, yuh see it?
Mi come from di light, run inna di dark like a marathon, yuh see it?
Poland man, colder dan di land
Cyaan fuck wid disrespect (Not at all)
Bring yuh mathematics when it come to trigonometry
Nigga, don't try it (Not at all)
Not a gyallis, but di gyal dem a blow up mi phone like, "Can you take a call?" (Not at all)
Rather have an exotic than a goddamn Honda Accord (Not at all)Embed
