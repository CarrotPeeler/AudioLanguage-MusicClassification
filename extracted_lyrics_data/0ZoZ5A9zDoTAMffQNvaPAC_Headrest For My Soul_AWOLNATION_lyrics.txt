(Go)

There's a leak in this boat
Someone toss me a rope
And a headrest for my, headrest for my soul

There's a leak in this boat
How the hell will I float
With this headrest for my, headrest for my soul?
I got a headrest for my, headrest for my soul, uh

Let the whispers unfold
And darlin', do what you're told
Headrest for my, headrest for my soul

If the hospital burns
If it's really my turn, yeah
How the hell will I, how the hell should I learn?

There's a leak in this boat
Someone toss me a rope
And a headrest for my, headrest for my soul
You might also like
Give me that headrest for my, headrest for my soul
You know I got a headrest for my, headrest for my soul5Embed
