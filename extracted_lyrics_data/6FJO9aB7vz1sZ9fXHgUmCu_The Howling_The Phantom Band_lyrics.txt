1 ContributorThe Howling LyricsTimely certain darkness come
Lay your finger down
Close my eyes and still my tongue
Make me dust again
Something nameless
A creeping unrest
Hard as we tried to be blessed
Always we ended up with less
Than we started with
Will there be a ghost on the day I die?
Following, fallen, dust I tried
To live beyond my lust and lie
It's all that I was
Well carry my body on the reckoning wind
Howling, howling
Fate shall brightly descend to love
Then take flight, then take flight
To bide away in an eerie hive
Between the day and night
But on earth when use
Timely our troops
Set your fingers under the noose
You held my legs and you cut me loose
And sent me through the gate
Well carry my body on the reckoning wind
What was flesh is dust again
Leave my spirit 'cause lust and sin
Is all that I was
Will there be a ghost on the day we die?
Howling, howling
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh
Will there be a ghost on the day I die?
Following, fallen, dust I tried
To live beyond my lust and lie
It's all that I was
Well carry my body on the reckoning wind
Howling, howling
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh
Carry my body on the reckoning wind
What was flesh is dust again
Leave my spirit 'cause lust and sin
Is all that I was
Will there be a ghost on the day we die?
Howling, howling
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh, ohh
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh, ohh
Ah, ah, ah, ah-ah
Oh, oh, oh, ohhYou might also likeEmbed
