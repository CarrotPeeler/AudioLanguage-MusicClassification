1 ContributorThe Eggs Inside Pandoras Box Lyrics( intro)
*hits blunt* " And I'm just thinking out loud."
Soul told me the chicken came before the egg
( verse 1 )
Mankind, is woman man kinda ?/
What kinda Mandela effected and protect their sexes?/
Texas/
Guess I'm awake of all mistakes of mans imperfections/
Mentality, menstrual, mineral ,monumental
Mentors who play menace /men torn the apprentice/
History books don't print this/
Finger prints(prince) at the princess/
Cause she will only die(Diana) and a king will be born/
Mother nature cries but redeem with every storm/
The beard isn't the key for mansion to be worn/
The queen is the key to command this very swarm/
But you don't see the keyword, command. There we torn/
( hook )
The man on the moon was the man for the plot/
Stand on the mantle the plan for the plot
Focus on the chicken, but the plan was forgot/
Niggas stuck they Niggas like Pandora's box/
( verse 2 )
We see hell, female the bombs miss,iles/
This I'll, in store for the Christians , Krishna/
Cause Indian (in the end) god can be heard... Word/
They never heard god. It's the heavenly father/
I'm bugging./
The praying mantis ,can stay in the praying stances , patient/
Plan a date of a dancing, she stay in the way of  emancipatin/
This is romantic/
Romance in many ways/
A lot of mans to mentions/
This is the man dimension/
And they're telling her to sign up. She must get a membership/
Invade all her membranes, and now she don't remember shit/
But I'm passed that,  this assist/
The only thing we got is life../You might also likeEmbed
