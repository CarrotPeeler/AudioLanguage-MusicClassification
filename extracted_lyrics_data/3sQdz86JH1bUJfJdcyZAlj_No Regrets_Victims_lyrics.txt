1 ContributorTribes of the Future LyricsWe are dust - We are rain
The choice that no one
Has the courage to make
We are the people of the urban attrition
Generation of the virtual emotions
Born aside the collapse of your system
No regrets No remorse Not your victims
Tribes of the future tribes of tomorrow
Sons of collapsing time
Wireless survivors
Tribes of the future tribes of tomorrow
Sons of collapsing time
We are life - We are mess
The deeper calling of your inner excess
We are the people of the urban attriction
We are the miracle of human affliction
Generation of arsenical essence
Resurrection of a tribal resistance
Born aside the collapse of your system
No regrets No remorse Not your victims

Tribes of the future tribes of tomorrow
Sons of collapsing time
Wireless survivors
We are the tribes of the future
React now before it's too late
RE-ACT-NOW!
Tribes of the future tribes of tomorrow
Sons of collapsing time
Wireless survivors
Tribes of the future tribes of tomorrow
Sons of collapsing timeEmbed
