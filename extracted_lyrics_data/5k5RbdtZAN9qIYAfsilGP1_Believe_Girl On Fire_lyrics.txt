‘Till the morning sun
Up waiting until I’m home
You let your mind run
To places that I won’t go
I know you think you’ve got dirt on me
But baby I ain’t no hoe
I stay consistent
Tick like a metronome
Don’t you know?
Honey I
I need your love baby don’t let go of your hold on me (hold on me)
Because you’re my
My pretty mama but you can’t keep on controlling me (controlling me)
Pre-Hook 1
How many times did I say it ain’t what it seems
This ain’t the time or the place so don’t make a scene
I told you over and over, you dont believe me
Girl, I’m on fire and you are my gasoline

Verse 2
Like a fire on stage I’m Jimi
Make sure they catch my vibe
Call me young voodoo chile
It might get dangerous
If you can make that thing go wild
I can play it like Ziggy Stardust
I’ll make you feel good inside
So don’t you hide

Bridge
What’s this spell that I’m under?
Can you make it last longer?
Like it hot?
I’m ice cold
Give me like five more
(I need five more minute with you)
Because your crystal eyes always tell me your prediction
Will tonight be different baby?
