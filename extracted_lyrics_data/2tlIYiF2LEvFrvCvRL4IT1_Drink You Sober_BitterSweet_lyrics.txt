2 ContributorsDrink You Sober LyricsOh dear, look what you've done
You've made a mess of me and
I don't want to clean up
I'm dangerously high
You've seemed to quench my appetite
I want to drink you sober
I want to feel you
Oh my, where does the time go
It's after midnight, our clothes are strewn on the kitchen floor
You're tasty as a cake
A recipe I long to taint
I want to drink you sober
I want to feel you
Want you to be my lover
Be my lover
Oh no make no mistake
For I am just a cat, dressed up as a hungry snake
A delicate reprieve
A victim to my every need
I want to drink you sober
I want to feel you
Want you to be my lover
Be my lover
Need you to be my lover
Why don't you be my lover ?
Be my loverYou might also likeEmbed
