5 ContributorsRegorge in the Morgue Lyrics
Regorge

Trapped in cold steel
Nurture your body by your own skin
Panically painful, pharynx swollen from infected meat

Cannibalistic solution
Masticating bile
Phlegm and gastric juice
Putrid mucus
Arteries bursting
Nervous system collapse
Intestinal canal
Filled with your own flesh

Regorge in the morgue
Chewing, dribbling gluttony
Congested spews regurgitated
Regorge in the morgue
Visceral nutritious mush
Die with a purulent smile
Blegh

Decompose, canker
Already swallowed vomits
Anthropophagite, gluttonize
In your own festering flesh

Regorge in the morgue
Chewing, dribbling gluttony
Congested spews regurgitated
Regorge in the morgue
Visceral nutritious mush
Die with a purulent smileEmbed
