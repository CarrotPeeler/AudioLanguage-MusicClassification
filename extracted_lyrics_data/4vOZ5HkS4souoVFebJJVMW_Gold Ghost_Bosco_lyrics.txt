6 ContributorsGold Ghost Lyrics
Every day a new escape
I awake
Looking for the sun
Hoping that I never break
On the edge
Wanting me to trip and fall
Feeling every eye on me
 ignore
Got the feeling like they wanting more
Just wanna breathe

Cut me open wide, I won't hide
This memory won't know
Nothing comes easy, so I apologize
For what I've become, oh, but I don't belong
Sky falls, hide the night, burn to flames
Sky falls, and turns to dust, and there it remains
Sky falls, spark the night, burn to flames

Feels like I’m all used up
Numb
Drunk
Playing games I could never win
Saved by the sin
I’m at the bitter end
I place my bid
Bet on the score
Dice on the board (yeah)
You might also like
Cut me open wide, I won't hide
This memory won't know
Nothing comes easy, so I apologize
For what I've become, oh, but I don't belong
Sky falls, hide the night, burn to flames
Sky falls, and turns to dust, and there it remains
Sky falls, spark the night, burn to flames

Freefall from rays are cancelled out
Feel like flying till I hit the ground
Dancing in a dream full of dark
But I don't belong

Sky fall, sky fall, sky fall
Hide the night
Burn the place up, turn to dust
Spark the nightEmbed
