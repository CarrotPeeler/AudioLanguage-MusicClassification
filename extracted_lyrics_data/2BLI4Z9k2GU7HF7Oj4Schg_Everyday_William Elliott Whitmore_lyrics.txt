I could not help but think of you
The feeling shoots through me like a bullet
When I think of all the pain I put you through
Every day I can see that I'm a part of you
And you're a part of me
It all used to make so much more sense
And I'd have it all again if I could choose
I've lost some things over the years
But the memory I will not lose
As the sun goes down over that western field
I still can't help but think of you
Wherever you are I hope your wounds have healed
And you forgive me for the pain I put you through
Everyday it tortures me
I guess the apple fell too far from the treeYou might also likeEmbed
