3 ContributorsFine and Mellow LyricsMy man, he don't love me
He treats me, oh, so mean
My man, he don't love me
He treats me, oh, so mean
He's the meanest man that I've ever seen
My baby wears high peg pants, stripes are really yellow
Baby wears high peg pants, stripes are-a really yellow
When he starts into love me, he's so fine and mellow
Love will make you drink and gamble make you stay out all night long
Love will make you drink and gamble make you stay out all night long
Love will make you do things that you know is wrong
Do right, baby, if you stay home every day
I'll do right, baby, if you stay home every day
You're so mean and evil
I know you're gonna drive me away
Why did he leave me, why did he have to go
Why did he leave me, why did he have to go
Went off and left me, baby, I loved him so
I'll be a good wife to you
If it means anything to you
I'll stay home every night and I'll love you
And kiss you every night and one of these days
If you're good to me, honey, one of these days
If God is good to me, I'll bring you a little burny

'Cause without your loving I swear I'm gonna lose my mindEmbed
