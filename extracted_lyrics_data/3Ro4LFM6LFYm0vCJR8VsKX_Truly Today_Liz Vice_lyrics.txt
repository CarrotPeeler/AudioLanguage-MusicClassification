3 ContributorsTruly Today Lyrics
We are the ones who sinned
Enslaved from within
But You save, hallelu
Redemption in Your hands
And faith from blood that ran
Oh Jesus, You're truth

Simply put Your life for us
I sin upon You broke Your heart
Oh, You saw the pain through
We enjoy, how can it be?
Accepted, a fountain be
Yes Jesus, Ruakh

The beginning and the end of faith
We are come to love and obey
So remember us, oh Lord
When we come into Your Kingdom
May we hear You say
"Truly today You are mine, now and always"

In You we can begin
Find forgiveness and life within
Holy Spirit, You are true
Into Your hands we commit our lives
Into Your heart we will abide
Yes, You save, hallelu
You might also like
Simply put Your life for us
I sin upon You broke Your heart
Oh, You saw the pain through
We enjoy, how can it be?
Accepted, a fountain be
Yes Jesus, Ruakh

The beginning and the end of faith
We are come to love and obey
So remember us, oh Lord
When we come into Your Kingdom
May we hear You say
"Truly today we are Your's, now and always"

Hey, hey
Now and always, yeah
Now and always
Now and alwaysEmbed
