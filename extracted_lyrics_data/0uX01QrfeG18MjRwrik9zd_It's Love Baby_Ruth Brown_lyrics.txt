1 ContributorIt’s Love Baby (24 Hours Of The Day) LyricsBaby, I don't know why I love you
I don't know why I feel this way
Baby, I don't know why I love you
I don't know why I feel this way
But I think about you, baby
Twenty-four hours of the day
Well, honey, my days and nights are lonely
I need your lovin' through the day
Well, honey, my days and nights are lonely
I need your lovin' through the day
And I'd go home to my darlin'
Twenty-four hours of the day
From five o'clock in the early evenin'
Till six o'clock in the early mornin'
I could squeeze you with all of my might
If I can love ya til the broad daylight
Well, I'd come home to my darlin'
Twenty-four hours of the day

Oh from five o'clock in the early evenin'
Well, it's six o'clock in the early mornin'
I could squeeze you with all of my might
If I can love ya til thе broad daylight
Well, I'd come home to my darlin'
Twеnty-four hours of the dayYou might also likeEmbed
