1 ContributorMietziâ€™s Song Lyrics
You showed me, colours I'd never seen
There was so much we used to share
You took me places, that I never been

I close my eyes again and think of you

I hear your voice with every passing day
I see my sister's laughing face
I think about the things we used to say

I close my eyes again and think of you
I close my eyes again and think of you

I see myself in you
In all those little things you do
Took you in bed at night
Knowin' that everything's allright
Time slips away so fast
Sunny skies get overcast
I know, I know
I know, I know
I can't be there, there beside you
I can't be there, there to guide you
I can't be there, there to hold you know
You might also like
Close my eyes and think of you
Yeah yeah
Yeah yeah
I close my eyes and think of you
Yeah yeah
Yeah yeah
I close my eyes and think of you
Yeah yeah
Oh-uh-oh
I close my eyes and think of youEmbed
