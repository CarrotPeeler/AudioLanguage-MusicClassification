2 ContributorsTrouble Is Near LyricsAnd sorrow sinks into my
Breaking heart of coal
Disaster approaches as
Men lead us to the grave
And that fire
In their eyes
Waves of light
Burn so bright
My shell is scorched and scarred
Destiny manifests
Slash and burn, trudge and burrow
Men turn us into dust
And that fire
In their eyes
Waves of light
Burn so bright
The sixth extinction hollows me
All those who've passed
The kingdom is dying
A future of death
Destruction embraces me
I am sick
Stricken with rage and sadness
The future must change
You might also likeI have to bring them home
The strata of their birth
Disaster approaches and
Men will march to the grave
And that fire
In their eyes
Waves of light
Burn so bright
Plague infects, sink into me
Drought starves, sink into me
Continents divide, sink into me
Oceans rise, sink into meEmbed
