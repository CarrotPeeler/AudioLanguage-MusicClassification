3 ContributorsYou Should Have Gone To School Lyrics(You fool)
(You want it, you work for it)

I don't want to go
All the way to Mexico
Cause there's creatures in the air
And they watch you with a cold stare
And the preacher said  kid
But I'm lovin' it
I'm lovin' it

And you don't want to come up
All the way from San Antone
You're addicted to the sound
And you want to blow your brains out
Is it easy
When we're both like this
But I'm lovin' it
I'm lovin' it

You know what to do
You should have gone to school
(you want it, you work for it)
You fool
(you want it, you work for it)
You might also like
Find me at the station
With a whole new take on God
One who isn't on the run
As forgiving as a cold sun
The conductor said "Get on now, kid"
And I'm lovin' it
I'm lovin' it

You know what to do
You should have gone to school
(you want it, you work for it)
You fool
(you want it, you work for it)

Why does it feel like I'm perfectly still
When I'm flying through the glass of my automobile
And the more that I feel like I'm fallin'
I want to do it again
(That's no way to treat a friend)
(you want it you work for it)
You fool
(you want it you work for it)
You foolEmbed
