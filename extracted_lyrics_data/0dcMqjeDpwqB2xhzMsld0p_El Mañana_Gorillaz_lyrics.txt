Summer don't know me no more
He got mad, tiresome
Summer don't know me
He'd just let me low in myself

'Cause I do know love
From you then
Just dying

I saw that day
Lost my mind
Lord, I'm fine
Maybe in time
You'll want to be mine

Don't stop the bud when it comes
It's the dawn, you'll see
Money won't get there
Ten years passed tonight, you'll flee

If you do that
I'll be sworn
To find you
You might also like
I saw that day
Lost my mind
Lord, I'm fine
Maybe in time
You'll want to be mine

I saw that day
Lost my mind
Lord, I'm fine
Maybe in time
You'll want to be mine

Maybe in time
You'll want to be mine
Maybe in time
You'll want to be mine
Maybe in time
You'll want to be mine
Maybe in time
You'll want to be mine28Embed
