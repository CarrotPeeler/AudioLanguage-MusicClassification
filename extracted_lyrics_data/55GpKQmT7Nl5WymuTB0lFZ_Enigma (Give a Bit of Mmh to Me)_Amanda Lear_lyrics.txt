2 ContributorsEnigma (Give a Bit of Mmh to Me) LyricsGive a bit of mmh to me
And I'll give a bit of mmh to you
Give a bit of mmh to me
And I'll give a bit of mmh to you
And your eyes like a laser
Every time cut me deeper
Give a bit of mmh to me (you're a mystery)
And I'll give a bit of mmh to you (it's so confusing)
Give a bit of mmh to me (you're a mystery)
And I'll give a bit of mmh to you (it's so confusing)
For me, you are an enigma
For me, you really are a mystery
A mystery (a mystery)
For you, I break all the rules
And for you, I'll go to the moon
'Cause you're the one
There's no one else
There's no one else
Give a bit of mmh to me (you're a mystery)
And I'll give a bit of mmh to you (it's so confusing)
Give a bit of mmh to me (you're a mystery)
And I'll give a bit of mmh to you (it's so confusing)

Are you question or answer?
Are you real, or am I dreaming?
Give a bit of mmh to me (you're a mystery)
And I'll give a bit of mmh to you (it's so confusing)
Give a bit of mmh to me (you're a mystery)
And I'll give a bit of mmh to you (it's so confusing)Embed
