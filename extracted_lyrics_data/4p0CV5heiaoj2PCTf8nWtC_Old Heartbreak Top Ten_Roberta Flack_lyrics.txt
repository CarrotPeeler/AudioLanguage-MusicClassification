3 ContributorsOld Heartbreak Top Ten LyricsThey played our song again today
And my heart broke all over again
There's just no way to run away
From the old heart break top ten
Well there must be millions
Whom seem that old heartbreak top ten
Yeah
I would be so grateful
If I never had to sing it again
I tried another love you see
And you seek, and you seek
I thought that my poor heart would heal
Oh but you the only love for me
And that's how I know our love was real
Don't play that song again
Makes me remember when
When you were loving me
We were so happyYou might also likeEmbed
