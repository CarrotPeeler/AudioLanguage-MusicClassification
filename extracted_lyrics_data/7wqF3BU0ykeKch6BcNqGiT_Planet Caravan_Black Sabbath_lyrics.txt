48 ContributorsPlanet Caravan Lyrics
We sail through endless skies
Stars shine like eyes
The black night sighs
The moon in silver trees
Falls down in tears, light of the night
The Earth, a purple blaze
Of sapphire haze
In orbit always

While down below the trees
Bathed in cool breeze
Silver starlight breaks down from night
And so, we pass on by the crimson eye
Of great god Mars
As we travel the universe
