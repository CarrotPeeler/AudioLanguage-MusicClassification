5 ContributorsMelting Ice Lyrics
Sailing to a distant port
To meet your reflection on some desert shore
Running up the coast
I walk through a mirror and out of your ghost

Hide you, not seek you or flee here I must
Before you can melt down my iceberg of trust

Passing clouds hold on to shadows
Melting ice leaves nowhere to go

Sailing to a distant port
To meet your reflection on some desert shore
Tried to keep your heart
Burning down bridges to break from the past

Hide you, not seek you or flee here I must
Before you can melt down my iceberg of trust

Passing clouds hold on to shadows
Pouring light on ancient shipwrecks
Passing clouds hold on to shadows
Melting ice leaves nowhere to go
You might also like
Driving through the rain
I sold all my wishes to play the odd game

Hide you, not seek you or flee here I must
Before you can melt down my iceberg of trust

Passing clouds hold on to shadows
Melting ice leaves nowhere to go


Passing clouds hold on to shadows
Pouring light on ancient shipwrecks
Passing clouds hold on to shadows
Pouring light on ancient shipwrecks

Passing clouds hold on to shadows
Melting ice leaves nowhere to goEmbed
