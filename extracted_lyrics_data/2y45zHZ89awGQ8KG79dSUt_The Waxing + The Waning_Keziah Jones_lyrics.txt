1 ContributorThe Waxing + The Waning LyricsI'll stay
If you confess today
I'll know
If moonshine
Or sunshine's the name
For this
Crimson colored kisses
I'll die
Let the Hellstones rain down
On my
Head
Crimson in ma head
Head
You're the eye of the storm
Chorus
The waxing + the waning of the moon
Has got me realising why
The motion of the ocean's
Deep inside my mind
My mind
"The waxing and the waning"
I'll go
I just thought you should know
I'll go
Witches don't scare me
I know
Witches don't hear me
We're alive !
We're alive !
We're alive !
We're alive !
You're the eye of the stormYou might also likeEmbed
