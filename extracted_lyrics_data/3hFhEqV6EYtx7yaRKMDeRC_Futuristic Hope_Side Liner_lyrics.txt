2 ContributorsRemind Body Lyrics
Please push, double time
Letting luck never interface workplace
Stepping unsure, here is a thick waste
Into a limp crawl
I'll beckon not through the sloth, making that call
Allow rest for a shallow guess
But watch out for some half-truth
Consider active roots up on radio
Living groove sliced in half, or bilabial class undefined
Remind body one, speak with raw power
Confident steps never arch Leon into powerless discord
A thirty six hour stroll through a rhyme path
In many lines, they hoard the clout
It's like thе baddest assumptions, packed off and produced
Bе getting loose, like the heel in my head
Overused, but reclined
Remind body two, you're dead if you cannot move with force

"Put my foot down, and begin to stroll"
"God (god), bless my soul"
"Put my foot down, and begin to stroll"
(scratches)
"Put my foot down, and begin to stroll"
"God (god), bless my soul"
"Put my foot down, and begin to stroll"
You might also like
Of course now is a quick flash
We Doublespeek first
For Yan, here's a prototype
And everlast, when effect clogs the bars
The jaw hurts
A pinch of a pinch of periods
Allows me, to analyze
The key for a real phenomenon
Which consists on violence
Smoking-ism, cream(?) cataclysm, catechism
Sex, fun and murderous intentions
Not to mention, the system
You know, the psychological parasite that exists mutually with ignorance
Hence these misconceptions
Cloud of perceptions, these interjections
Essential to a well-balanced break
Fast my flag, hangs at half mass
Imprisoned in the past with hope, of a futuristic blast
To break through, all of this congestion
Inhibiting the progression
And natural state of social flux
These kids are looped like old chucks, on the telephone
Why, why are you running in place, with this potential?
A new kinetic, you tell me not to sweat it
Just forget it, let it slide
But I side in cynicism, or foot-upper-ism
(Put my foot down and begin to stroll) The nature of the paradox (Put my foot down and begin to stroll)
"God (god), bless my soul"
"Put my foot down and begin to stroll"
(scratches)
"Put my foot down and begin to stroll"
"Put my foot down"
"God (god), bless my soul"
"Put my foot down and begin to stroll"

Remind body three, of the natural progression
Remind body four, of the musical impression
Maintain to preserve the urge of the first step
To form, into second
Points on parallel paths, become runways for soulcrafts
Kinetically in sync for a split sec

Set it down with graphs and clips
We object to apply the best of all lines and tune
Extra legs are required to retract the room
Push fire out of cold breath
A burning rubber is the measure of death, for no soul
And you do not burn, you churn space until every move is less than whole

"Put my foot down and begin to stroll"
"Put my foot down and begin to stroll"
"Put my foot down and begin to stroll"
(scratches)
"Put my foot down"
(scratches)
"Put my foot down"Embed
