3 ContributorsCome On LyricsAnd finally the silence
Looking out
Looking back across the sky
Trying to find a meaning
Knowing that I just left it all behind
Still I smell a lingering softness
Where did she go
How did she go
I wanna
I wanna know
I wanna know that she'll be coming
Here to me
Come on
Without you
I'll never feel the love inside of me
Come On, you know that we belong
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Thinking back before her
I never knew the meaning of alone
Still the flag is feeling foreign
I live the day to escape into a phone
Speaking of a world not real then
Where did she go
How did she go
I wanna
I wanna know
I wanna know that she'll be coming
Here to me

Without you
I'll never feel the love inside of me
Come On, you know that we belong
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Cause each of her kisses and my heart misses . . 
She's coming
She's coming here to me
I'm needing
Desiring to kiss her now
I'm living for her
Breathing for her
Singing for her fairytale
Come on
Without you
I'll never feel the love inside of me
Come On, you know that we belong
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on
Without you
I'll never feel the love inside of me
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Come onEmbed
