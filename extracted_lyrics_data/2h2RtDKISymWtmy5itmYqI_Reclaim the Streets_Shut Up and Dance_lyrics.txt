2 ContributorsRevolutionary Step Lyrics
Do the revolutionary step
You know there's a dance
Do the dance, do the dance
Do the revolutionary step
Do the dance
Do the revolutionary step

Now let the troop introduce the latest dance
Guaranteed to rip through your favourite pants
Originated by who? The ladies' man
Promoe rock the mike with a stable hand
Forward ever, backward never
All my revolutionary steppers and wall wreckers
It takes a nation of million of cops to get us
Cosmic here to break up all the government setups
Stay one step ahead, move your dancing feet
We gon' let the dead groove to this bouncin' beat
Already a smash hit, 'cause it sound so sweet
Already a classic, 'cause it sound so street
Now you better blast this to stress the system
And you better flash this to impress the sistren
The hottest fashion, tonight in the club
Supreme's hated with a passion by the government thugs
You might also like
Do the revolutionary step
A dance you will never forget
Do the revolutionary step
Step forward my sisters, step forward
Do the revolutionary step
A dance you will never forget
Do the revolutionary step
Step forward brother, forward

Now forget about poppin' pills, still
Forget about standin' still, there's still a few hours 'til
They gon' close the place up, but who gives a fuck
Reclaim the streets tonight, watch me how I step it up
Watch us how we steppin' out, shake them shakers
Eliminate negativity, too late to hate us
Outrageous footwork, no more running man
Come on and celebrate, 'cause we free and we love it man
This shit a blow up the system like it blows up your sound system
Move somethin', jump up and down twistin'
While cops twistin' your arm, pump your fist 'til you're warm
My people resisting with charm
Resistin' arrest, if you're pissed and oppressed
Rely on Looptroop to put out hits to the death
You feel no pain when it hits in your chest
They might be blind, now they wish they were deaf
Do the revolutionary step
A dance you will never forget
Do the revolutionary step
Step forward my sisters, step forward
Do the revolutionary step
A dance you will never forget
Do the revolutionary step
All my brothers, step forward, forward

Do the dance
You know there's a dance
Do the dance
Do the dance

Yo, when our true fanbase do the new dance craze
We stomp and earthquake and shake the landscape
This giant step is like a smilin' threat
I see violent femmes looking wild and wet
And the style is fresh, feel alive and blessed
My girls holdin' it down, no matter how trife it gets
Yo, liberate yourself from mental entrapment
Keep them both feet movin' and them hands clappin'
Traffic blocking, barricade the streets
Cops clockin' clockin', when they hear us sing
But Looptroop rockin', never face defeat
No stoppin' stoppin', yo, serious thing
You had enough? Then put your foot down, march and sing along
Show 'em how the troop sounds when we 10000 strong
It's a 10000 miles long marathon
Movin' out of Babylon and we're singin' this song
Do the revolutionary step
A dance you will never forget
Do the revolutionary step
Step up, step up
Do the revolutionary step
A dance you will never forget
Do the revolutionary step
Forward fi ever

Do the dance
You know there's a dance
Do the dance
You know there's a dance
Do the dance
Do the danceEmbed
