3 ContributorsThe Pantheon (Ainâ€™t Gonna Catch You) Lyrics
Gods ain't gonna help you, son
You'll be sorry for what you done
Them gods gonna hurt you, son
When you play with a loaded gun
When you play with a loaded gun

They ain't gonna catch you when you fall
You'll be pleading while you're bleeding

They ain't gonna hear ya son
Don't care about what you done
They ain't gonna help you son
You'll be sorry for what you done
Be sorry for what you done

Old Pyth, cranky old bull
Make you sorry for what you done
Hense, in a black veil
Gonna prick you for what you done
Roathus got you empty
Got you weeping for what you done
I say mother, lonely old gal
Tear your heart out for what you done
Tear your heart out for what you done
You might also like
They ain't gonna catch you when you fall
You'll be pleading while you're bleeding

Them gods gonna hurt you son
You'll be sorry for what you done
You'll be sorry for what you doneEmbed
