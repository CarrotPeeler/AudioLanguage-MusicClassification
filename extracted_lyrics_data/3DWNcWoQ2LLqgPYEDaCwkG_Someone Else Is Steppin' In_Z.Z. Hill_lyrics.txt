2 ContributorsSomeone Else Is Steppinâ€™ In Lyrics
I came home this morning
And oh, what a shock
When I found out my key
No longer fit my lock

She said, "Oh baby
You can go back where you've been, oh Lord
See, you've been steppin' out
Now someone else is steppin' in"

Since I was a fool
That you could count on
One that you could call
When no one else was at home

Oh baby
Remember how you treated me then
See, you've been steppin' out
Now someone else is steppin' in

So cry your heart out
You won't get through to me
I'm a brand new woman
And everyone can see
A new way of walkin' (New way of walkin')
Is long overdue (Long overdue)
My broken heart is mending
And I'm finally over you
You might also like
She said I got a new way of wearin' my hair
Got a smile on my face
And you didn't put it there

Oh baby
I done found myself a new friend
See, you've been steppin' out
Now someone else is steppin' in

So cry your heart out
But you won't get through to me
I'm a brand new woman
And everyone can see
A new way of walkin' (New way of walkin')
Is long overdue (Long overdue)
My broken heart is mending
And I'm finally over you

She say I got a new way of wearin' my hair
Got a smile on my face
And you didn't put it there
Oh baby
I done found myself a new friend, oh Lord
See, you've been steppin' out
Now someone else is steppin' in

She say you've been steppin' out
Now someone else is steppin' in, oh baby
She say you've been steppin' out, baby
Someone else is steppin' in
She said, you've been steppin' out, yeah
And someone else is steppin' inEmbed
