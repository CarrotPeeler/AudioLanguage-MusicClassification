1 ContributorWhat I Do LyricsDaddy did you see me ride my bike?
I said yeah son
I have been watching you
And daddy did you see me fly that kite?
I said yes little man
I have been watching you
Chorus:
Cuz that's what I do
It's my job to watch you grow up
To be there to help you know
What is right and what is wrong
It's what I do
I'll protect you from the bad guys
And dry those little sad eyes for as long as you want me to
It's what I do
Dad did you see me drive that car?
I said yeah son
I have been watching you
So can I take her to the graduation ball?
I said yeah son
But ill keep my eye on you
Chorus:
Cuz that's what I do
It's my job to watch you grow up
To be there to help you know
What is right and what is wrong
It's what I do
I still protect you from the bad guys
Be your buddy; be your alibi for as long as you want me to
It's what I do
You might also likeAnd when the time comes
I must leave you
Just know that I'll never be far from you
Chorus:
It's what I do
It's my job to watch you grow up
To be there to help you know
What is right and what is wrong
It's what I do
When you have a child you'll know just what I've been doing
All these years for you
It's what I do
It's what I doEmbed
