3 ContributorsLeave A Scar LyricsThe old man was a good man, he raised his children right
Taught us how to work hard and showed us how to fight
Told me about the good Lord and when to use a gun
Made me very proud of where it is that I come from
When I die, put my bones in the Dixie dirt
Look down on me smilin', I don't want no feelins' hurt
All I leave behind me is a ragged old guitar
I may not change the world but I'm gonna leave a scar
Years they rolled on by, the old man turned me loose
Way 'cross town I learned about them sad old country blues
Taught me how to pour out my heart and try to make it rhyme
Told me not to ever break but one law at a time
When I die, put my bones in the Dixie dirt
Look down on me smilin', I don't want no feelins' hurt
All I leave behind me is a ragged old guitar
I may not change the world but I'm gonna leave a scar
I hope you wear me on your memory like a faded old tattoo
I might not make no history book but I'll burn a page or two
When I die, put my bones in the Dixie dirt
Look down on me smilin', I don't want no feelins' hurt
All I leave behind me is a ragged old guitar
I may not change the world but I'm gonna leave a scarSee Blackberry Smoke LiveGet tickets as low as $38You might also likeEmbed
