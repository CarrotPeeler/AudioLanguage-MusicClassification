Did your wants of sin
Crumble at your feet?
Does the blood on your face
And in your hands taste too sweet?

And in my mind
You were looking fine
Well isolation
Well and inside, you ain't fine to me
Well isolation, desolation

Don't wait for me
Well at the edge of the world
Yeah, don't come to me at all
The way you look and think of me
Well it's much
Much
Much
Much too small

And in my mind
You were looking fine
Well isolation
Well and inside, you ain't fine to me
Well isolation, desolation
You might also like
Don't wait for me
Well at the edge of the world
Yeah, don't come to me at all yeah
The way you look and think of me
Well it's much
Much
Much
Much too small

And in my mind
You were looking fine
Well isolation
Well and inside, you ain't fine to me
Well isolation, desolationEmbed
