3 ContributorsHigh Rising Lyrics
I was in the city right
Yeah
Walking a dog
Bumped into a nigga
I ain’t seen in many moons ago
So I checked his pedigree
Just to see what he know
Whats really going on
Where did you get your info
He started talking in a stutter
Cris crossing his numbers
Fidgetting with his fingers
He’s was up to something
So I looked around
See what’s going down
Life is hot in crack town
And I’m the ODD MAN OUT

We sitting high rising
Watching the city lights
But we ain’t high signin’
We trump tight
Every nights a black knight
Whether wrong or right
Love must go through hell just to come out right
NIGGA
We sitting high rising
Watching the city lights
But we ain’t high signin’
We trump tight
Every nights a black knight
Whether wrong or right
Love must go through hell just to come out right

Angels with dirty faces -YEAH-
The bad news bears
Counterfeit jinx money and they don’t play fair
Never trust a gambler
In a gambling house
Mr Smith will go to Washington He’ll snitch and sell you out
About your house across the street drug ring and pent house
So they underworld the edge of the city is where I hide out
But first I hit Angel’s alley in the New Jersey drive
I Get a G-ride
Gone in 60 seconds
Mr. Three Strikes
The bride came C.O.D
That’s how Bonnie met Clyde
Murder on a  honeymoon we the fugitive kind
The town
The bank job badlands
In the summer time
The outlaw
I’m the prince valiant
Fastest gun alive
It’s a dangerous profession in the heat of the night
I killed the beast of the city
And the beast with five fingers
Public enemy number 1
Guess who’s coming to dinner
I killed the beast of the city
And the beast with five fingers
Public enemy number 1
Guess who’s coming to dinner
Wassup wassup man …..i ain't seen you in a long time
What’s good what’s good…nah where you get that shit from
Nigga why you talking like that…nigga why you actin like that
Whats up!!! oh shit!!!!! damn

We sitting high rising
Watching the city lights
But we ain’t high signin’
We trump tight
Every nights a black knight
Whether wrong or right
Love must go through hell just to come out right
NIGGA
We sitting high rising
Watching the city lights
But we ain’t high signin’
We trump tight
Every nights a black knight
Whether wrong or right
Love must go through hell just to come out right

I do it for the unfortunate
The one with no parents but the streets are their Orphanage
Against all odds
So we heating like torches bitch
Feel so much pain in the hood
That some lost in it
Long beach were police frame niggas like portraits
Two or more blacks in the car
They bringing reinforcements in
Home of the early coffins all the shit we go against
Just to succeed
They wonder why the greed is so intense
In the fast lane ain't no lames living off of this
Catch u face to face you fake snake you coming off your shit
Everything of value how you think
That you exploiting us
Never brought a dollar back
Now it's no avoiding us
I do it for those raised in the struggle
By any means to bubble so they stay up in some trouble
These ghetto situations will turn a saint into a rebel
We hustle to see the light at the end of the tunnel
Black Knight whether wrong or right
Watchin the city lights

Raised in the struggle
We hustle to see the light at the end of the tunnelEmbed
