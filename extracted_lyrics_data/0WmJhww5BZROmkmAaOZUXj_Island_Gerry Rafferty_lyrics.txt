4 ContributorsIsland LyricsWake up, my love
The sun is shinin' out there, blue sky up above
It's a brand new day
Let's walk outside and let that breeze blow all our cares away
You know that way back there in that city life, we've been strangers for so long
Now that I feel like I know you again, I wanna stay
So long ago, yeah
We had a love so warm and bright when we had just begun
That was my last dream
Since then, I've watched the rest crumble one by one
Since we've been runnin' silent, yeah, it's felt so right
It's gettin' closer now every day
Now that I feel like I know you again, I wanna stay
Sha la la, sha la la
Sha la la, sha la la
Sha la la, sha la la
Sha la la, sha la la
Sha la la, sha la la
Sha la la, sha la la
Sha la la, sha la la
Sha la la

I need someone who needs me
I only know that wherever you are, I wanna be
But from now on, we won't worry 'bout a thing
Yeah, the past is gone
This is our last day, yeah
We're gonna make sweet love before we sail away
Sha la la, sha la la
Sha la la, sha la la
Sha la la, sha la la
Sha la la, sha la la
Sha la la, sha la la
Sha la la, sha la la
Sha la la, sha la la
Sha la la, sha la la
Sha la la, sha la la
Sha la la, sha la la
Sha la la, sha la la
Sha la la, sha la la
