You need to stop running
Every time I'm there
Your heart starts rushing
Think that I don't know
You certainly feel something
I've seen that look before
You need to stop running
You see my face again
You see my face again
You need to stop running
Every time I'm there
Your heart starts rushing
Think that I don't know
You certainly feel something
I've seen that look before
You need to stop running...
(You need to stop running)
(Your heart starts rushing)
(You certainly feel something)
(You need to stop running)
You see my face again
You need to stop running
Every time I'm there
Your heart starts rushing
Think that I don't know
You certainly feel something
I've seen that look before
You need to stop running...
