10 ContributorsCaravan Lyrics
And the caravan is on it's way
I can hear the merry gypsies play
Mama, mama look at Emma Rose
She's a-playin' with the radio

La, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la

And the caravan has all my friends
It will stay with me until the end
Gypsy Robin and sweet Emma Rose
Tell me everything I need to know

La, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la

Turn up your radio
And let me hear the song
Switch on your electric light
Then we can get down to what is really wrong
I long to hold you tight
So I can feel you
Sweet lady of the night
I shall reveal you
If you will, turn it up, turn it up, little bit higher, radio
Turn it up, turn it up, so you know, radio
You might also like
La, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la

And the caravan is painted red and white
That means everybody's staying overnight
Yeah, the barefoot gypsy player round the campfire sing and play
And a woman tells us of her ways

La, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la

Turn up your radio
And a-let a-me hear the song
Switch on your electric light
Then we can get down to what is really wrong
I long just to hold you tight
So, baby, I can feel you
Sweet lady of the night
I shall reveal you
If you will, turn it up, turn it up, little bit higher, radio
Turn it up, that's enough, so you know it's got soul
Radio, radio, turn it up, hmm
La, la, la, la-la, la, la,  la-la, la-la-la, la, la-la-la
La, la-la-la, la-la-la, la, la, la-la, la, la-la-la
La, la-la-la, la-la-la, la, la-la-la, la, la-la-la
La, la-la-la, la-la-la, la, la-la-la, la, la-la-la
La, la-la-la, la-la-la, la, la-la-la, la, la-la-la
La, la-la-la, la-la-la, la, la-la-la, la, la-la-la
La, la-la-la, la-la-la, la, la-la-la, la, la-la-la
La, la-la-la, la-la-la, la, la-la-la, la, la-la-la1Embed
