Lived with crazy paving all your life
Something in her eyes just tells you no
Hoping conversation starts to flow
Stuck inside a wheel inside a wheel
Wondering everyday is it all for real?
Aching every time a cold wind blows
My love don't fear the mighty rose
Tangerine, Tangerine
What you gonna do when the old man bleeds you dry
Step down from the plane and pluck the eye
Slide in deeper closer to the bone
Don't you just wish your heart was made of stone
Waxing like an old cracked forty-five
Counting out the ways you can stay alive
Placed in body bags and filled with stones
My love won't bleed her waves are foam
And when you think it's all over
It's not over, it's not over
Who killed Tangerine? Prettiest girl I've ever seen

It's not over, it's not overEmbed
