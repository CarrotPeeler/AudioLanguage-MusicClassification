But now my roaming days have gone
Too many irons in the fire is worse than not having any
I've had my share and from now on..
I'm puttin' all my eggs in one basket
I'm betting everything I've got on you
I'm giving all my love to one baby
Heaven help me if my baby don't come true
I've got a great big amount saved up in my love account
Honey, and I've decided love divided in two won't do
So I'm putting all my egs in one basket
I'm betting everything I've got on you
I'm puttin' all my eggs in one basket
I'm betting everything I've got on you
I'm giving all my love to one baby
Heaven help me if my baby don't come true
I've tried to love more than one, finding it just can't be done
Honey, there's one I lied to when I tried to be true to two
So I'm putting all my eggs in one basket
I'm betting everything I've got on youYou might also likeEmbed
