3 ContributorsNails LyricsI'm never going to change, I'm never going to change a thing and
What is there to gain pretending you're something when you're not
And there's nothing left of how things used to be

To nail the blame
To nail the blame of your mistakes
To anyone but you

I'm cutting the cord
I'm cutting the cord that keeps me
I'm cutting the ties
I'm cutting the ties that bind my feet to the ground

It's getting harder to stay true
When we were younger but that's not to say we should give in

To nail the blame
To nail the blame of your mistakes
To anyone but you

I'm cutting the cord
I'm cutting the cord that keeps me
I'm cutting the ties
I'm cutting the ties that bind my feet to the ground
My head in the sand

And when did the doors start to
Close and why did we just turn away?
In favour of some passing
Trend that lets us down everyday
And do we believe in the words?
Do we believe in the words that we say
When we're screaming in each other's faces
Just like the good old days?Embed
