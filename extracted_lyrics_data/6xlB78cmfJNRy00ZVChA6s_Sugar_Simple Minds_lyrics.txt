I still can't get enough
Lover, I got sugar on the brain
These sun sets so fine, drink the heavy wine
Lover never did the sugar thing
So shout it out
Tell me it now
I need to know you wanna do those things
Hope you can stay on
Hope you lead me on
Hope we can produce that special thing
Take me away from this place
Take me up into the space
Moonshine, sunshine
Brother I got sugar on the brain
Shout, shout aloud
I still can't get enough
I wonder what relieves me from this pain
Shine, shine your love
I hope you lead me on
Lover, we got sugar on the brain
The sun sets so fine
If you drink your heavy wine
Lover never did the sugar thing
Take me away from this place
Take me up into the space
Sugar
It tastes like sugar
Moonshine, sunshine
Any place you want count me in
Moonshine, anytime
Lover I got you, come here
It tastes like sugar
It tastes like sugar
It tastes like sugar
