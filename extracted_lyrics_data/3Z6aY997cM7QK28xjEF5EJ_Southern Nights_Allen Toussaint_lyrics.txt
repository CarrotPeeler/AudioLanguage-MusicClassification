10 ContributorsSouthern Nights Lyrics
Southern nights
Have you ever felt a southern night?
Free as a breeze
Not to mention the trees
Whistling tunes that you know and love so

Southern skies
Just as good even when closed your eyes
I apologize
To anyone who can truly say
That he has found a better way

Feel so good
Feel so good, it's frightenin'
Wish I could
Stop this world from fighting
La da da da da da la da da da da da da da da

Southern skies
Have you ever noticed southern skies?
Its precious beauty lies deep beyond the eye
Goes running through your soul
Like the stories told of old
You might also like
Old man
He and his dog they walked the old land
Every flower touched his cold hand
As he slowly walked by
The weeping willow would cry for joy

Mysteries
Like this and many others in the trees
Blow in the night
In the southern skies

La da da da da da la da da da da da
Da da da da da da da da da da daEmbed
