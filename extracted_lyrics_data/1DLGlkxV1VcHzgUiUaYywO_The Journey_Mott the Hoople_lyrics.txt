3 ContributorsThe Journey LyricsAll the changes, they will take their time
In the morning dust, they'll begin to ride
Halfway to a borderline
Well, I can see the end for the very first time
Well, I know I lost just a little bit on the journey
When my mind's been split by little things that didn't fit on the way
Oh, I know I lost just a little bit on the journey
'Cause I'm trying so hard to get home
There's a man on a bridge called suicide
And he hides his head while the coast is dark
And the river drags and the water sways
Oh, his rags have seen better days
Oh, I guess he lost just a little bit on the journey
For his mind was split by little things that didn't fit on the way
Oh yes, I know he lost just a little bit on the journey
For every gift he had to give
For every life, yeah, he had to live
Well, they meant nothing without her to guide him on his way
Well, he told her he was a leader of a well-respected load
But when he tried to leave her, well, she looked right down her nose
Yeah, many times he tried to make her believe in herself
But she wouldn't listen to a word he said
You might also likeWell, he followed her though the darkness, all the chances I take
He followed her though the wilderness, her mystery to break
Many times, he tried to make her believe in herself
But she wouldn't listen to a word he said
So for forty days and for forty nights
Well, they tied my hands, made me see the light
And the angel screamed in my nightmare ride
And the changes left, yeah, but they will take their time
And I guess I lost just a little bit on the journey
Yes, I know I lost just a little bit on the way
I know I lost just a little bit on the journey
Oh I know I lost just a little bit on the journey
Yes, I guess I lost just a little bit on the way
Yes, I know I lost just a little bit on the journey
