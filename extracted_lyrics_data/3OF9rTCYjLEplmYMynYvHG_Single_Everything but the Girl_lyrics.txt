7 ContributorsSingle Lyrics
I called you from the hotel phone
I haven't dialed this code before
I'm sleeping later, waking later
I'm eating less and thinking more
And how am I without you?
Am I more myself or less myself?
I feel younger, louder
Like I don't always connect
Like I don't ever connect

And do you like being single?
Do you want me back?
Do you want me back?
Do I like being single?
Am I coming back?
Am I coming back?

I'll put my suitcase here for now
I'll turn the TV to the bed
But if no one calls and I don't speak all day
Do I disappear?
And look at me without you
I'm quite proud of myself
I feel reckless, clumsy
Like I'm making a mistake
A really big mistake
You might also like
And do you like being single?
Do you want me back?
Do you want me back?
Do I like being single?
Am I coming back?
Am I coming back?
Do you want me back?
Do you want me back?
Do you want me back?
Do you want me back?
Do you want me back?
Do you want me back?

And now I know
Each time I go
I don't really know
What I think I know
And now I know
Each time I go
I don't really know
What I think I know

Do you want me back?
Do you want me back?
Do you want me back?
Do you want me back?Embed
