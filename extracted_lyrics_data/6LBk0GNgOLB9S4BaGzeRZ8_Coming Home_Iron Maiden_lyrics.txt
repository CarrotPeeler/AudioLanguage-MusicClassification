15 ContributorsComing Home Lyrics
When I stand before you shining
In the early morning sun
When I feel the engines roar
And I think of what we've done
Oh, the bittersweet reflection
As we kiss the earth goodbye
As the waves and echoes of the towns
Become the ghosts of time

Over borders that divide
The earthbound tribes
No creed and no religion
Just a hundred winged souls
We will ride this Thunderbird
Silver shadows on the earth
A thousand leagues away
Our land of birth

To Albion's land
Coming home when I see
The runway lights
In the misty dawn, the night is fading fast
Coming home, far away
As the vapour trails alight
Where I've been tonight
You know I will not stay

Curving on the edge of daylight
Till it slips into the void
Waited in the long night, dreaming
Till the sun is born again
Stretch the fingers of my hand
Cover countries with my span
Just a lonely satellite
A speck of dust in cosmic sand

Over borders that divide
The earthbound tribes
Flown the dark Atlantic
Over mariners' stormy graves
We will ride this Thunderbird
Silver shadows on the earth
A thousand leagues away
Our land of birth

To Albion's land
Coming home when I see
The runway lights
In the misty dawn, the night is fading fast
Coming home, far away
As their vapour trails alight
Where I've been tonight
You know I will not stay

To Albion's land
Coming home when I see
The runway lights
In the misty dawn, the night is fading fast
Coming home, far away
As their vapour trails alight
Where I've been tonight
You know I will not stay
To Albion's land
Coming home when I see
The runway lights
In the misty dawn, the night is fading fast
Coming home, far away
As their vapour trails alight
Where I've been tonight
You know I will not stayEmbed
