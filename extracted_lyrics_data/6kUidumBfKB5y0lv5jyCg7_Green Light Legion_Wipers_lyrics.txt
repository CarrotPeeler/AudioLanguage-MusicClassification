1 ContributorGreen Light Legion LyricsMy sixth sense tells me something's wronge here
I'm used to steering straight
You look at something standing
It's crumbling away
You leave me sometimes wheelings
All by myself
If you keep on changing signal
It stops somewhere else
It's only madness
It's alright now
The signals turning
Won't be stuck anymore here
All by myself
Can't live a life of competing
With somebody else
The light's green - I won't stop
The green light's come and all is clear here
I need you to change form red
If you look for their promises
They will stop you dead

It's alright now
We won't be stopping
Can't turn around
The light's green - I won't stopEmbed
