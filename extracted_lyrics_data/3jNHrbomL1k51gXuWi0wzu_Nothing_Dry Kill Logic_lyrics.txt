2 ContributorsNothing Lyrics
Do you want to step to this?
Wanna mess with this?
Wanna piss on this?
You're on my shit list
Did you lie to me?
Are you blind to see?
I never ever gave a fuck of what you thought of me
How can I trust you when I know you?
Nothing meant more to me than you
You took, I gave, your breath - please save

Now I see clearly
You'll pay for this dearly
Everything that I thought we had was a lie
What goes around comes around
Once lost now I am found
All of this hatred I focus on you

I have nothing
You've given me nothing
And I thought we had something
To believe in
Deceiving
I have nothing
You've given me nothing
And I
Thought we had something
To believe in
Deceiving
Stop!
You might also like
My point of view you don't seem to like
It seems to me that you don't like
To smile but you don't want to be my friend
'Cuz we are on again, then we're off again, then we're on again Let's not pretend
That this could ever be
It can't - you see?

Now I see clearly
You'll pay for this dearly
Everything that I thought we had was a lie
What goes around comes around
Once lost now I am found
All of this hatred I focus on you

I have nothing
You've given me nothing
And I thought we had something
To believe in
Deceiving
I have nothing
You've given me nothing
And I thought we had something
To believe in
Deceiving
I have nothing
You've given me nothing
And I thought we had something
To believe in
Deceiving
I have nothing
You've given me nothing
And I thought we had something
To believe in
Deceiving
I have nothing
You've given me nothing
And I thought we had something
To believe in
Deceiving
I have nothing
You've given me nothing
And I thought we had something
To believe in
Deceiving

Nothing
Nothing
Nothing
Nothing
