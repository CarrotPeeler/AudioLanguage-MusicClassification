People get together
Make a joyful sound
Play that funky music 'til the sun come up
People get down
Can't get enough
Whenever they hear this song
Get up
Drive down
Start singing along
Deep down in Mississippi
South of Tennessee
In the back woods
Under the sycamore tree
Just like a bee
Make the honey drip
Chompin at the bit
Little Mizzip
Pull the wagon over and
Let me be the mule
Let me pay my tithe
Before I play the fool
Milk that cow
Plow that hoe
Plant that seed
Part it with the hoe
Deep down in Mississippi
South of Tennessee
In the back woods
Under the sycamore tree
There's a girl I know
Who can shake her hips
Got me chompin at the bit
Little Mizzip
Deep down in Mississippi
South of Tennessee
In the back woods
Where you gonna find me
Take her hips
Make the honey drip
Right on the tip
Little Mizzip
She's a trip
Little Mississipp
She can shake her hips
Little Mizzip
Make the honey drip
Little Mississipp
??
Little Mizzip
No more ship?
Little Mississipp
Lose my grip
Little Mizzup
Deep down in Mississippi
South of Tennessee
In the back woods
Under the sycamore tree
Just like a bee
Make the honey drip
Chompin at the bit
Little Mizzip
Deep down in Mississippi
South of Tennessee
In the back woods
Under the sycamore tree
There's a girl I know
Who can shake her hips
Got me chompin at the bit
Little Mizzip
Deep down in Mississippi
South of Tennessee
In the back woods
Where you gonna find me
Take her hips
Make the honey drip
Right on the lips
Little Mizzip
