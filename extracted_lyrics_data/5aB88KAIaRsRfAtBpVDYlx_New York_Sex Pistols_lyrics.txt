33 ContributorsNew York Lyrics
An imitation from New York
You're made in Japan from cheese and chalk
You're hippie tarts hero 'cause you put on bad show
You put on bad show, oh, don't let it show

Still out on those pills
Oh, do you remember?

Think it's swell playing Max's Kansas
You're looking bored and you're acting flash
With nothing in your gut, you better keep your mouth shut
You better keep your mouth shut, you're in a rut

Still out on those pills
Do the sambo

Four years on, you still look the same
I think about time you changed your brain
You're just a pile of shit, coming to this
You poor little faggot
You're sealed with a kiss
Kiss me
You might also like

Think it's swell playing in Japan
When everybody knows Japan is a dishpan
You're just a pile of shit, you're coming to this
You poor little faggot, you're sealed with a kiss

Still out on those pills
Cheap thrills, Anadins, Aspros, anything
You're condemned to eternal bullshit
You're sealed with a kiss
Kiss me

A kiss, a kiss, you're sealed with a kiss
Looking for a kiss and coming to this
Oh, a kiss
You do just about anything
Well, kiss this
