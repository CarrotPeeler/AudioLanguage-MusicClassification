1 ContributorWine LyricsWhat is it to praise?
Make yourself particles
What is it to know something of God?
Burn inside that presence
Burn up
Copper melts in the healing elixir
So melt yourself in the mixture that sustains existence
You tighten your two hands together
Determined not to give up
Saying “I” and “we"
This tightening blocks you
No more wine for me
I'm past delighting in the thick red and the clear white
I'm thirsty for my own blood
As it moves into a field of action
Draw the keenеst blade you have and strike
Until thе head circles about the body
Make a mountain of skulls like that
Split me apart
Don't stop at the mouth
Don't listen to anything I say
I must enter the center of the fire
Fire is my child
But I must be consumed and become fire
Why is there crackling and smoke?
Because the firewood and the flames are still talking
In the blackness these two friends keep arguing
Like a wanderer with no face
Like the most powerful bird in existence
Sitting on its perch, refusing to move
What can I say to someone so curled up with wanting
So constricted in his love?
Break your pitcher against a rock
We don’t need any longer to haul pieces of the ocean around
We must drown, away from heroism
And descriptions of heroism
Like a pure spirit lying down, pulling its body over it
Like a bride pulling her husband
For a cover to keep her warm
Learn to light the candle
Rise with the sun
Turn away from the cave of your sleeping
That way, a thorn expands to a rose
A particular glows with the universal

Make yourself particles
What is it to know something of God?
Burn inside that presence
Burn up
Copper melts in the healing elixir
So melt yourself in the mixture that sustains existence
You tighten your two hands together
Determined not to give up
Saying “I” and “we"
This tightening blocks you
No more wine for me
I'm past delighting in the thick red and the clear white
I'm thirsty for my own blood
As it moves into a field of action

Until the head circles about the body
Make a mountain of skulls like that

Don't listen to anything I say

Fire is my child
But I must be consumed and become fire
Why is there crackling and smoke?
Because the firewood and the flames are still talking
In the blackness these two friends keep arguing
Like a wanderer with no face
Like the most powerful bird in existence
Sitting on its perch, refusing to move
What can I say to someone so curled up with wanting
So constricted in his love?
Break your pitcher against a rock
We don’t need any longer to haul pieces of the ocean around
We must drown, away from heroism
And descriptions of heroism
Like a pure spirit lying down, pulling its body over it
Here is a letter to everyone
You open it
It says, "Live"
Now I see something in my listeners
That won’t let me continue this way
The ocean flows back in and puts up a foam barrier
And then withdraws
What is it to praise?
Make yourself particles
What is it to know something of God?
Burn inside that presence
Burn up
Copper melts in the healing elixir
So melt yourself in the mixture that sustains existence
You tighten your two hands together
Determined not to give up
Saying “I” and “we”
This tightening blocks you
No more wine for meEmbed
