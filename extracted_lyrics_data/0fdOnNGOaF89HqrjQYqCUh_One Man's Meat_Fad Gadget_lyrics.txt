I felt like dropping down
Sick in the street
I could hardly care about walking
Dragged along with no force in my feet
And all the bones in me knocking

Worn down by caution
Make numb with restraint
In all of my sweetness
I retch and I faint

One man's meat
But I could not taste the poison
I'm so beat
That I feel like dropping down
One man's meat
Now my life is not worth living
I'll just walk the street
'Till I feel like dropping down

I could be steeped in the washing and weeping
Or burn up in frenzy or fire
A wistful wish for the having and keeping
A desperate deed led by desire
You might also like
Wrapped in the moment
Weighed by thought
I stretch on the pavement
And feel myself caught

One man's meat
But I could not taste the poison
I'm so beat
That I feel like dropping down
One man's meat
Now my life is not worth living
I'll just walk the street
'Till I feel like dropping down

One man's meat
I'm so beat
One man's meat
I'll just walk the street
One man's meat
I'm so beat
One man's meat
I'll just walk the street
Wrapped in the moment
Weighed by thought
I stretch on the pavement
And feel myself caught

One man's meat
But I could not taste the poison
I'm so beat
That I feel like dropping down
One man's meat
Now my life is not worth living
I'll just walk the street
'Till I feel like dropping down

One man's meat
But I could not taste the poison
I'm so beat
That I feel like dropping down
One man's meat
Now my life is not worth living
I'll just walk the street
'Till I feel like dropping down
One man's meat
I'm so beat
One man's meat
I'll just walk the street

One man's meat
But I could not taste the poison
I'm so beat
That I feel like dropping down
One man's meat
Now my life is not worth living
I'll just walk the street
'Till I feel like dropping down

One man's meat
I'm so beatEmbed
