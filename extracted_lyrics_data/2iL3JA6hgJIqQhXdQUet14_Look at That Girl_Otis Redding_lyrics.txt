5 ContributorsLook At That Girl Lyrics
I saw her dancing, dancing
In some old smokey place
I bet I was the only one there
To watch her face
All night, I never saw her smile there
'Cause she didn't even try
You know for just a little while there
I saw a tear in her eye

(Got to go back) Come on
(And watch that little girl dance)
Come on, baby, I love to see you, now
(Got to go back) Ooh-wee
(And watch that little girl dance)
One more time, baby, watch me swingin', huh

I sit and watch her on the floor
I said, baby, baby, baby
Come on, baby, just dance some more
I wonder how it is to love her?
I toss and turn in my bed
The way she dance to the music
She's got me going out of my head
You might also like
(Got to go back) Come on
(And watch that little girl dance)
One more time, you fine, foxy thing, you
(Got to go back) Huh, yeah
(And watch that little girl dance)
One more time, this is what she'd do

She'd do this, mmm
She'd walk the mellow-man a little bit
Then she'd skate a little bit
Then she'd boogaloo a little bit
Then she'd twist a little bit, I gotta

(Got to go back) One more time
(And watch that little girl dance)
I got to see her on the floor, now, now
(Got to go back) Gotta, gotta
(And watch that little girl dance)
I gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta see her now, now

(Got to go back) One more time
(And watch that little girl dance)
Sweet little thing, sweet little thing
You sweet little thing, you sweet little thing
(Got to go back) Come on, watch that
(And watch that little girl dance)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, baby, now, now...Embed
