4 ContributorsCondolences Lyrics
If I could replay, if I could replay, that whole scene again
Oh, well, I took a fool's way out, oh yeah
Without one good reason why

I shouldn’t be around y'all niggas
Matter fact, I should down y'all niggas
Can’t stand y'all niggas
(I don't know, sometimes, I don't think it's worth it)
Gave you water, should've drowned y'all niggas
.40 knock a couple pounds off niggas
(And I'm really feeling-)
This a sound-off, nigga
Salute to the real
Where I’m from, you’ll shoot or you get killed
This is really how it is
(I don't know, sometimes, I don’t think it's worth it)
All facts, no fictions
No marks is allowed on my missions
(And I'm really feeling-)
Can't handle my business
I’m tryna buy me a house
These fuck niggas wanna die for some clout
Better try another route
(I don't know, sometimes, I don't think it's worth it)
You'll miss the gold on yo' neck fat
All Money In, and the culture gon' respect that
(And I'm really feeling-)
It's never gon' be another like Cuh
Fly Crip but he was bright like a light bulb
A young 2Pac for this generation
(-feeling kind of bad)
You raised a nation on motivation, face it
Hater took your life, wit' no hesitation
Y'all seen his gangsta, we seen his greatness
(I don't know, sometimes, I don't think it's worth it)
(His greatness)
This whole world really full of fakeness
When I say, "Fuck 'em all", bitch, I'm bein' gracious
(And I'm really feeling-)
Hatred
So I gotta keep a strap
How a king get killed by a rat
Boy, I swear this shit a trap
(I don't know, sometimes, I don't think it's worth it)
Especially when you young and you Black
Two choices: keep a gun, or get smacked
(And I'm really feeling-)
Nigga, these is facts
I put my pain in the bottle
Kill oue leaders they'd rather niggas follow
Hollow tip shells, and you know I'm finna shoot it
How we let 'em get Nip and ain't do shit? (how we let 'em do it)
True shit
But you know legends never die
Nipsey chunkin' big Ns in the sky (big Ns in the sky)
And you wonder why, you never seen a real nigga cry
I stay away, I don't feel niggas' vibes
Keep the steel in the ride
I give a fuck 'bout new cases
Aye, Cuh, we still off that "Blue Laces"
"Dedication" (dedication)
(I don't know, sometimes, I don't think it's worth it)
We still bangin' "Double Up"
Never let a hard time humble us
(And I'm really feeling-)
Blessings happen right after the trouble come
Sunshine right after the thunder done
(I don't know, sometimes, I don't think it's worth it)
(After the trouble come)
Yo, Nip, you was really one of one
You had the Cuban, all my niggas wanted one (really wanted one)
I'm 'bout change, give a fuck what niggas 'bout
Hey, dear God, I know Hussle in ya House (I know Hussle in the House)
I'm 'bout change, give a fuck what niggas 'bout
Hey, dear God, I know Hussle in ya House
You might also like
Yeah, I send my condolences, to his family, with love, love
Has Nipsey died in vain? Not on no hater's name
God makes His choices, we can never explain
It's still our money, still runnin' this marathon
Rest in peace, Mr. Hussle
I'll see you on the other side, on the other side1Embed
