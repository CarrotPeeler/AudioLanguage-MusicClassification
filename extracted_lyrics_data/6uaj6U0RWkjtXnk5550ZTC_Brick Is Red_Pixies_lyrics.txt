20 ContributorsBrick Is Red Lyrics

A fish is fast and Jimmy's cast
Hang me!
A white moon's hot, the other side's not
Hang me!

It's not time for me to go
It's not time for me to go

My eyes have turned just the color of diamond
Just the color, the pretty color of ice
Diamond, just the color
The pretty color of iceSee Pixies LiveGet tickets as low as $45You might also like4Embed
