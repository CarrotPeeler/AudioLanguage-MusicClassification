4 ContributorsYou Win, I Lose Lyrics
You win, and I lose
I beg, and you choose
You're so cool, and I'm confused
Well I'm me, and you're you
You're so loose, and I'm uptight
You're day, and I'm night

Like two ships in the night in foggy weather
Just a-waitin' for fresh winds to blow
Maybe we're losin' one another
I could be wrong I don't know

You get the best, I get the rest
You passed the test, I'm just a mess
You got it made, I'm in the shade

Like two ships in the night in foggy weather
Just a-waitin' for fresh winds to blow
Maybe we're losin' one another
I could be wrong I don't know
Like two dopes in the boat, without a paddle
Just a-wonderin' why it don't go
We could be losin' one another
I could be wrong I don't know
You might also like
I know you're tryin' to phase me
It's gonna drive me crazy
Now I can't wait for the day when

I win, and you lose
You beg and I choose
You're in the shade, I'm on parade

Like two ships in the night in foggy weather
Just a-waitin' for fresh winds to blow
Maybe we're losin' one another
I could be wrong I don't know
Like two dopes in the boat, without a paddle
Just a-wonderin' why it don't go
We could be losin' one another
I could be wrong I don't know

Like two ships in the night in foggy weather
Just a-waitin' for fresh winds to blow
Maybe we're losin' one another
I could be wrong I don't know
Like two dopes in the boat, without a paddle
Just a-wonderin' why it don't go
We could be losin' one another
I could be wrong I don't know
Like two ships in the night in foggy weather
Just a-waitin' for fresh winds to blow
Maybe we're losin' one another
I could be wrong I don't know
Like two dopes in the boat, without a paddle
Just a-wonderin' why it don't go
We could be losin' one another
I could be wrong I don't know

Like two ships in the night in foggy weather
Just a-waitin' for fresh winds to blow
Maybe we're losin' one another
I could be wrong I don't know...Embed
