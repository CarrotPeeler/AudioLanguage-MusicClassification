1 ContributorHot Shot Love LyricsPeverett - Riff Bros. Music - ASCAP
Your love is lifting me higher and higher
You're so warm you set my soul on fire
Fan the flame, I feel my temperature rise
All that I need, your love satisfies
You're so fine, you know how to please me
Take me higher, then you let me down easy
Making love, how sweet it can be
I can't believe, what you're doin' to me
Girl I want you so bad
You're driving me mad
Let your love run free
It feels so good to me
Love, I'm talkin' 'bout your love
I'm talkin' 'bout your love
Your hot shot love
{Rod - Slide Solo}
Your love is lifting me higher and higher
You're so warm you set my soul on fire
Making love, how sweet it can be
Oh baby, what you're doing to me
