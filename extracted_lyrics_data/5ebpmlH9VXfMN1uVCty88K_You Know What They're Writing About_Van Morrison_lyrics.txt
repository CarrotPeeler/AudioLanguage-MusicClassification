4 ContributorsYou Know What They’re Writing About Lyrics
You know, yeah, you, you know what they're writing about
Baby you, you know what they're talking about
Baby you, you know what they're writing about
Baby you know, you know what they're talking about
It's a thing called love down through the ages
It makes you wanna cry sometimes
It makes you feel like you wanna lay down and die sometimes
It makes you high sometimes
But when you really get in, in, in, in, it lifts you right up

You know what they're, you know what
You know what they're talking about
Baby you, you, you, you, you, you, you
You know what, what they're writing about
It's a thing, it's a thing, it's love baby
Ain't it a wonderful game?
Ain't it a wonderful, marvelous game? (Yeah)
Ain't it a wonderful, ain't it a wonderful, ain't it a wonderful game?
And when there's no more words to say about love I go
Nnnh, nnnh

You know what they're talking about
Meet me down, yeah, meet me down
Meet me down by the river, baby
Meet me down, meet me down by the river
Meet me down, meet me down
Meet me by, by the water
Meet me down by the water
Baby you know, I said you know what they're
You know what they're talking about
I want you to meet me, meet me down by the pylons
Meet me down by the pylons
Meet me down by the pylons
Meet me down by the pylons
Meet me, oh, oh, said meet me
I got something I wanna give you
I got something I wanna give you
