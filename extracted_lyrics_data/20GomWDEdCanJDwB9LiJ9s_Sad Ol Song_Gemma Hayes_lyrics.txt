1 ContributorSad Olâ€™ Song LyricsIt's a wave from a car as it exits the driveway
It's that silent awkward motion
The goodbye that you didn't say
It's that sad song on the line
That cuts right through your rib cage and gets stuck inside
As the wheels kick dust in your view
You know the longer you look
The further she'll get from you
Where's the light now you've only got the shade?
Well she took all the colour
Now it's back to black and white days
That sad song stings your eyes
Singing "I wonder do I ever cross your mind?"
Such a sad ol' song
Such a sad ol' song
Such a sad ol' songYou might also likeEmbed
