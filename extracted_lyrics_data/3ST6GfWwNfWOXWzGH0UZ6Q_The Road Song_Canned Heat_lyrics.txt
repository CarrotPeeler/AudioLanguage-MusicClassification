Dark road all by myself
Well, dontcha hear me cryin'?

Flag that train
That's the train my baby's on
Well, dontcha hear me cryin'?
Yo-oh, hoo

Asked her for water
She gave me gasoline
Well, dontcha hear me cryin'?
Yo-oh, hoo
Yo-oh, hoo-ooh

Yo-oh
How long, how long
Has that fearin' train been gone?
Well, dontcha hear me cryin'?
Yo-oh, hoo
