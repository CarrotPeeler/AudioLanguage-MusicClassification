2 ContributorsSurge Of Pity Lyrics
A lie hurts more than the truth
My favorite scary colour, peered
Into the darkness these small uncertain moves
Is there any truth in their words?
Misfortune never come singly
They went over to my enemies
Fighting against heavy odds
Shameless lie uncontrolled figures

Bow to the inevitable
Life playing such games
Can you really answer these
Harmless questions of life?

Audience of the madness
Remnants of my mind
Invading my thoughts
Conjure up the spirit of the dead
Of the dead

Audience of the madness
Remnants of my mind
Invading my thoughts
Conjure up the spirit of the dead
Of the dead

Deeds speak louder than words
Harsh actions a suspicious look
The pricking of thorns
The sting of remorse
The stimulus of praise
Listening to this dead march
Under a maze of pity
A surge of pity
The pricking of thorns
The stimulus of praise

Deeds speak louder than words
Harsh actions a suspicious look
The pricking of thorns
The sting of remorse
The stimulus of praise
Listening to this dead march
Under a maze of pity
A surge of pity
The pricking of thorns
The stimulus of praiseEmbed
