Wanna do the  in a  piece of man
This world outside  we stand
When I know in my heart
That is supposed to play apart
But just can’t even  in that two

I Don’t care  bout’ your reaction
I Don’t care that I don’t care
I don’t need  attention
And I don’t care I'm coming back to say
That I don’t care , I don’t care
I don’t care , I don’t care

 to sleep through the winter begin
I couldn’t bring myself  talk to my friends
When I know in my heart
That is supposed to play apart
But just can’t even  in that two

I don’t care  bout’ your reaction
I don’t care that I don’t care
I don’t need  attention
And I don’t care I'm coming back to say
That I don’t care , I don’t care
I don’t care,  I don’t care
I don’t care,  I don’t care
I don’t care,  I don’t careEmbed
