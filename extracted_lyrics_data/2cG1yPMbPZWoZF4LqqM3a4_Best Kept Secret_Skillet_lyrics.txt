8 ContributorsBest Kept Secret Lyrics
Shrouded in proof, You're the mystery
You're the truth that lives within the world we see
You're the hand that holds destiny

And I can't pretend I don't know
And I can't leave it alone (yeah, yeah)

You're the best kept secret in my generation
The best kept secret of all time
You're the best kept secret in my generation
And I found you out

You're the hope over the centuries
You're the cosmic force that rules the galaxies
You're the evidence that demands our belief

And I cannot live for myself
I cannot keep this all to myself (yeah, yeah)

You're the best kept secret in my generation
The best kept secret of all time
You're the best kept secret in my generation
And I found you out
