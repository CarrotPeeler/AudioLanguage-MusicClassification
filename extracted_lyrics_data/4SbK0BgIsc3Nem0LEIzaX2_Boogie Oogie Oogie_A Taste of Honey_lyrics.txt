If you're thinkin' you're too cool to boogie
Boy, oh, boy, have I got news for you
Everybody here tonight must boogie
Let me tell ya, you are no exception to the rule

Get on up on the floor
'Cause we're gonna boogie-oogie-oogie
'Til you just can't boogie no more (No more boogie)
Boogie no more (No more boogie)
You can't boogie no more (No more boogie)
Boogie no more (No more boogie)
Listen to the music


There's no time to waste (Ooh)
Let's get the show on the road
Listen to the music and let your body flow
The sooner we begin, the longer we've got to groove! (Ooh)
Listen to the music and let yo' body move (Music feelin' good)

Now get on up on the floor
'Cause we're gonna boogie-oogie-oogie
'Til you just can't boogie no more (No more boogie)
Boogie no more (No more boogie)
You can't boogie no more (No more boogie)
Boogie no more (No more boogie)
Listen to my bass here
