I want it all the time, sex is on my mind
I want it all the time, sex is on my mind
Want it-want it all the time, sex is on my mind
I want it all the time, sex is on my mind
I want it all the time, sex is on my mind
Want it-want it all the time, sex is on my mind

Steppin' on the gas and blowin' all my stash with a bad chick who love to map, I'm talkin' cash
O.G., I'ma finna ash
So you ain't even gotta ask if you know
She fuckin' with a G
I keeps it one thousand and my whip stay swingin'
So we just keep callin'
But she beggin' me to change
Don't make the rules, I play the game (You know)
Pull up to the crib
I know she gon' deliver, got a number eight figure
Booty like a stripper but I got a girl at home
Should leave this pimpin' life alone (You know)

But I seem to keep choosin'
See a dime and I-I-I can't keep it movin'
Why I tell her I'ma change? (I'm gon' change)
Plenty women on the brain (Plenty women on the brain)
You know (You know)
Man, I'm full of excuses (Full of excuses, call it out)
Fuck around and my girl gon' give me the deuces (She give me the deuces)
Why I tell her I'ma change? (Why I tell her I'm gonna change?)
Plenty women on the brain (Ooh oh)
You know (You know)
You might also like
I want it all the time, (Sex) sex is on my mind (On my mind)
I want it all the time, (Sex) sex is on my mind (On my mind)
Want it-want it all the time, (Sex) sex is on my mind (On my mind)
Want it all the time-want it all the time (You know)

I treat her like a lady, love it when I spoil her
Take her down then we go high up like sequoias
Take her back to where she live
Oh, yeah, she know just what it is (You know)
Got them VVS stones, oh now she lieks them
She's like, "Daddy, you somethin'"
Oh, girl, it's nothin'
Triple shots of this Patr√≥n
And I'll be turnin' off my phone (You know)
I love my baby, don't get it confused
My favorite place in the world is next to you
Keep the cobra in the pants, try to be a better man
You know (You know)

But I seem to keep choosin' (Choosin')
See a dime and I-I-I can't keep it movin' (I can't keep it movin')
Why I tell her I'ma change? (Change)
Plenty women on the brain (Plenty women on the brain)
You know (You know)
Man, I'm full of excuses (Excuses)
Fuck around and my girl gon' give me the deuces
Why I tell her I'ma change? (Change)
Plenty women on the brain (Plenty women, they can't get enough, oh)
You know (You know)
I want it all the time, (Sex) sex is on my mind (On my mind)
I want it all the time, (Sex) sex is on my mind (On my mind)

Want it all the time-want it all the time (You know)
I want it all the time, (Sex) sex is on my mind (On my mind)
I want it all the time, (Sex) sex is on my mind (On my mind)
Want it-want it all the time, (Sex) sex is on my mind (On my mind)
Want it all the time-want it all the time (You know)

But I seem to keep choosin' (Choosin')
See a dime and I-I-I can't keep it movin' (I can't keep it movin')
Why I tell her I'ma change? (Tell her, I'm gonna)
Plenty women on the brain
You know (Ooh, girl, you know)
Man, I'm full of excuses
Fuck around and my girl gon' give me the deuces (My girl gon' give me the deuces)
Why I tell her I'ma change? (Change)
Plenty women on the brain (Plenty women on the brain)
You know (You know)

I want it all the time, sex is on my mind (Can't keep choosin', baby)
I want it all the time (I'm wit'chu), sex is on my mind
Want it-want it (Yeah) all the time, sex is on my mind
Want it all the time-want it all the time
I want it all the time, sex is on my mind

Want it-want it all the time, sex is on my mind
Want it all the time-want it all the timeEmbed
