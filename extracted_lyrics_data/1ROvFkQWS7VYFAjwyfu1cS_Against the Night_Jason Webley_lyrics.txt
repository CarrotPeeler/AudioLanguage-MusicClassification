1 ContributorAgainst the Night LyricsHold on to these words
I'd like to think that they may offer some protection
Against the night
Against the night
Your life can feel transparent, a reflection
A trick of light
So when sleep just won't come
And you've got no occupation
But nibbling at the fruit of the melancholy tree
Just hold on to these words, hold on to me
Just hold on to these words
They're the best I've got to offer at the moment
As a lullaby
As a lullaby
You can lay down by the tracks
And feel the world slip by
So when sleep just won't come
And you've got no occupation
But nibbling at the fruit of the melancholy tree
Just hold on to these words, hold on to meYou might also likeEmbed
