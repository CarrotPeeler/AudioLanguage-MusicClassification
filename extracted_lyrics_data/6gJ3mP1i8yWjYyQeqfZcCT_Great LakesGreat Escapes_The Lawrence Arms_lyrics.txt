6 ContributorsGreat Lakes/Great Escapes Lyrics
I scratched my name into the table
The knife and phone just fucking lay there
I orchestrate a day of routine elements
These letters are so old and faded

And in the end we'll burn in history
I'll take a chance and fall in love tonight
I'm lost and found. So lost again
I wonder as I'm wandering

I used to paint myself with sentiment
But all my colors always turn to gray
I spent the night out on the wire again
But I wasn't looking for a savior

And in the end we'll burn in history
I'll take a chance and fall in love tonight
I'm lost and found. So lost again
I don't worry when I'm wandering

Great Lake - I don't need a Great Escape
Tonight, I've got this city on my side
See The Lawrence Arms LiveGet tickets as low as $65You might also like
And in the end we'll burn in history
Yeah, I could fall in love with her tonight
I'm lost and found. So lost again
Nothing to do but keep on wandering

We can live with our mistakes
All my friends are going out tonight
And I can't sit here just waiting for another day to die
Fuck all this ancient history (x3)Embed
