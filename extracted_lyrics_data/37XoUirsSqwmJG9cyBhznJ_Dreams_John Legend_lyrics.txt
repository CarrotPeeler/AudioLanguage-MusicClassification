14 ContributorsDreams Lyrics

Baby, it seems the time is never right
You're goin' left and I'm goin' right
Its crazy
But I'm still waiting

If I play my cards right
My lucks gonna strike
Until then there's a night
All I wanna do

Is dream, dream, dream, dream
Dream, dream, dream, dream
Like lovers do
And it might come true

If I dream, dream, dream, dream
Dream, dream, dream, dream
It just might be the only time that I'm with you
When I dream, dream, dream
Dream, dream, dream
Oh, I dream
Yes, I dream
Dream, dream
Dream, dream
They say that dreams they sometimes do come true

Your star shines so bright
You're the queen of my night
In the daytime not quite
But I'm so glad that I

Can dream, dream, dream
Dream, dream, dream, dream
Like lovers do
And it might come true

If I dream, dream, dream
Dream, dream, dream, dream
It just might be the only time that I'm with you
When I dream, dream, dream
Dream, dream, dream
Of you7Embed
