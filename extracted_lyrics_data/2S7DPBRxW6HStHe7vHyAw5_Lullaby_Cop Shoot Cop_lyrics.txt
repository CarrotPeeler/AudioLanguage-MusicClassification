2 ContributorsLullaby LyricsHere I am
Putty in your hands
The rain is coming down
And I am coming down
Feel so small
Back against the wall
And I think of her
I feel like furniture
But her echo's slowly fading from my brain
Like a stranger's face seen from a passing train
Out of time
There ain't no perfect crime
And nobody to sing your lullaby
Feel so bad
Worst night I ever had
I walk the bridge of sighs
The tombs avert their eyes
All alone
Sinew on a bone
I watch the cars go by
Sounds like a lullaby
You might also likeWhen I nail my broken spirit to the ground
I can see your picture floating upside down
Out of time
There ain't no perfect crime
And nobody to sing your lullaby
I am a liar
I set it all on fire
And nobody will sing my lullaby
