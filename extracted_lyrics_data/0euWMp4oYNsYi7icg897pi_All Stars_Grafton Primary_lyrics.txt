2 ContributorsAll Stars LyricsIn the silence
Watching faces brighten
We are islands
Your heart is the sea
And the sound of music
The truth will move you
We are climbing
Out of the past the past the past
We are alive and living life
Inside the human heart is fire
And when you burn you burn to shine
Ignite the future take us higher
We are alive and living life
Inside the human heart is fire
And when you burn you burn to shine
Ignite the future take us higher
You remind me
Of someone I might be
You can find me
In the mirror when you see
In the spaces
A million faces
One mind to take us
Further than ever before before

Inside the human heart is fire
And when you burn you burn to shine
Ignite the future take us higher
We are alive and living life
Inside the human heart is fire
And when you burn you burn to shine
Ignite the future take us higher
Doesn’t matter who you are
You were all stars
And you will have your time to shine
You’re living yours I'm living mine
It doesn't matter who you are
You were all stars
And you will have your time to shine
You’re living yours I'm living mine
You’re living yours I'm living mine
You’re living yours I'm living mine
You’re living yours I'm living mine
You’re living yours I'm living mine
You’re living yours I'm living mine
