1 ContributorPersonal Stereo LyricsI'm coming back to play
But I don't know the rules
And I'm nobody's fool but myself
Just should I stay, or should I walk away? - I’ll stay
I'm coming back to play
But I don't know the rules
And I don't know the name of this game
Should you want it any other way – then it's OK
This one goes out to the one I love
This one goes out to the one I love
This one goes out to the one I love
Coming to you, on your personal stereo
I'm coming back to play
But I don't know the rules
And I'm nobody's fool but myself
Should you want it any other way – I’ll stay
I coming back to play
But there are still things to learn
About religion and science and love
I'm an amateur and you're a pro
This one goes out to the one I love
This one goes out to the one I love
This one goes out to the one I love
Coming to you, on your personal stereoYou might also likeEmbed
