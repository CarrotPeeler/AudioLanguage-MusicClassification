3 ContributorsLife In Motion LyricsYou can call me dreamer - You can call me plain
A tiny bit of sunshine in between the driving rains
You can call me father - You can cal me son
A little bit of yesterday & future wrapped in one
I am the provider - I'm the president
I am the forgiver here - thru time and time again
We are life in motion - with our chunk of time
Trembling in our hands - we wait for miracles
I am just a schoolboy - I am innocense
I am just a lonely kid behind that garden fence
I'm the voice of reason - I'm the scared soul
I'm eternal fire and your shelter from the cold
We are life in motion - with our chunk of time
Trembling in our hands we wait for miracles
We are life in motion - with our chunk of time
This years model blue eyed son - just waiting down the line
Sailing the high ways of the sun - we are waiting for the harvest
I am right beside you when you dream alone
Send you skies of comfort when in middle of a storm
Look and see the bottom of that endless hole
I'm right there to send three words to save your soul
Sailing the high ways of the sun - we are waiting for the dawn
And the harvest of our dreams
You might also likeI am right beside you when you dream alone
Send you skies of comfort when in middle of a storm
Look and see the bottom of that endless hole
I'm right there to send three words to save your soul
I am right beside you when you dream alone
I'm the voice of summer - now won't you ride the wave?
I am life in motion & the laugher on the scale
If you take me seriously - I'll take you serious too
Ride together into the sunset, that's all that we can do
You can call me dreamer - You can call me plain
A tiny bit of sunshine in between the driving rains
You can call me father - You can call me son
A little bit of yesterday & future wrapped in one
We are life in motion - with our chunk of time
Trembling in our hands we wait for miracles
Down the line - I am the forgiver!
I'm the voice of reason - I'm the sacred soul
I'm the voice of summer won't you take a ride
It's like coming home - coming home again
It's like coming home - coming home again
The further we go - the closer we come
There's one chance for everyone
One love - one heart - one chance
The higher we climb - the more we see
Lands and visions above the treetops
One love - One heart - One chance
It's like coming home - coming home again
It's like coming home - coming home againEmbed
