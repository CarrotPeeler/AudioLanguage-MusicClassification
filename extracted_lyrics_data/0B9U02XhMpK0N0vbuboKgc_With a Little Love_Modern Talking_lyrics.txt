5 ContributorsWith a Little Love Lyrics
They said: "Oh yeah, it's a tough world
You are restless and you are young"
I said: "Oh girl, it's a good twirl
And your time will come, your time will come"
They said: "You came from the wrong side
He's a page from the end of the book"
I said: "You came from the right side"
Took me just one look
Then you understood

With a little love you will survive
With a little love you will get by
Do what you want, go your own way
'Cause it's your life
(Life)

With a little love you'll make a start
Yeah, why lovers break each other's heart?
Do what you want, go your own way
'Cause it's your life

They said: "No future, forget it
You came from the wrong side of town"
I said: "Don't listen, don't let it
Let it bring you down
Make you wear a frown"
They said: "Oh, let him down easy
Laugh at the heart you have one"
I said: "That life is for living
Like the morning sun
It had just began"

With a little love you will survive
With a little love you will get by
Do what you want, go your own way
'Cause it's your life
(Life)

With a little love you'll make a start
Yeah, why lovers break each other's heart?
Do what you want, go your own way
'Cause it's your life
With a little love you'll make a start
Yeah, why lovers break each other's heart?
Do what you want, go your own way
'Cause it's your life
With a little love you'll make a start
Yeah, why lovers break each other's heart?
Do what you want, go your own way
'Cause it's your lifeEmbed
