4 Contributors1922 Blues LyricsWell I worked all summer couldn't save a cent
I gave all my money to the government
I don't know quite how it got spent
But the banks are coming for my deed, boys
Man at the mill can't see, boys
To let me get my feed for free, boys
Ain't that the way it is
Well I cut out down a gravel road
I traded my stock for a V-8 Ford
Dad's .410 down on the floor board
And the titles wrote down to me, boys
That gasoline ain't free, boys
This clutch wearin' out my knee, boys
Ain't that the way it is
Well I met me a woman down in St. Paul
I even met her mother and I met her Pa
Brother told me he'd bust my jaw
If I talked to his sister again, boys
Told me I couldn't win, boys
There's blood running down my chin now
Ain't that the way it is
Well I slept all night on the bar room floor
And woke up this morning my head was sore
Pockets empty but I want some more
The bar man's got my car, boys
Tabs worth more by far, boys
I'll leave her down at the bar now
Ain't that the way it is

I got me a job on a family farm
Times are hard here but I can't roam
And I ain't got nothing more, boys
I owe that company store, boys
Road's looking good for sure, boys
Ain't that the way it is
Well I worked all summer couldn't save a cent
I gave all my money to the government
I don't know quite how it got spent
But the banks are coming for my deed, boys
Man at the mill can't see, boys
To let me get my feed for free, boys
But ain't that the way it isEmbed
