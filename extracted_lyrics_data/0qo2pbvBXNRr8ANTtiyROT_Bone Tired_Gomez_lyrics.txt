1 ContributorBone Tired LyricsOh no, why do you always complain?
Burn bright but you're bone tired and feeling it
No matter what you hoist on up above, it always fails to keep the rain off
Could it be that it's not me that you're mad at?
But it's where you're taking it out
Where you're taking it out
And I swear I won't walk out
Taking the easy way out
Oh no, why are you always the same?
Burn bright but you're bone tired and there's no doubt
You're climbing up the ladder and you try to hoist a flag that says surrender
Could it be that there's no need to climb back down?
Put back what you've taken out
Back what you've taken out
And I swear I won't walk out
Taking the easy out
It's where you're taking it out
Taking it back allright
And I swear I won't walk out
Taking the easy way outYou might also likeEmbed
