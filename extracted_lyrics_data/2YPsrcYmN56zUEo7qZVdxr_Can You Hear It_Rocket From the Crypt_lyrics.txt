1 ContributorCan You Hear It? LyricsThe sirens are ringing in the summer time
It ain't a warning, it ain't a test
Air raids are blaring and it feels alright
You want more but you get less
It's gonna lose you, it's gonna fool you
It's gonna throw you off the scent and leave you behind
It's gonna lose you, it's gonna fool you
And leave you left by the promise of a compromise
Can you hear it, are you sleeping
Can you hear it, are you sleeping
Can you hear it, are you sleeping or not at home
Or are you not at home
Can you hear it, are you sleeping or not at home
Or are you not at home
All hail the sounds of summer timeYou might also likeEmbed
