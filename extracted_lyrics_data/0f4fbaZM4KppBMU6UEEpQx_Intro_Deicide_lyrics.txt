1 ContributorGalatian (Return of Judas) LyricsCall for betterment and leap into the sky
Bring us solitude to rule a million eyes
Give the war a face and seek into deicide
Your fear has come to me, I'll eat you up inside
Tear them sons apart and feed them to the raid
Ruthless masquerade, raped under the reign
Blackest sun of lust, raptured by the blade
And I will bury you underneath the hate
Bleed, killer
Bleed, killer
Bleed, killer
Bleed
Harvest, you're tireless
Keep us from hiding
Bleed, killer
Bleed, killer
Bleed, killer
Bleed
