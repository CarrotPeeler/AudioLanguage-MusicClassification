8 ContributorsHeroes LyricsI
I will be King
And you
You will be Queen
Though nothing
Will drive them away
We can be heroes
Just for one day
We can be heroes
Just for one day
You
You can be mean
And I
I'll drink all the time
'Cause we're lovers
And that is a fact
Yes, we're lovers
And that is that
Though nothing
Will keep us together
We could steal time
Just for one day
We can be heroes
For ever and ever
What d'you say?
You might also likeI
I wish you could swim
Like the dolphins
The dolphins can swim
Though nothing
Nothing will keep us together
We can beat them
Forever and ever
Oh, we can be heroes
Just for one day
I
I will be King
And you
You will be Queen
Though nothing
Will drive them away
We can be heroes
Just for one day
We can be us
Just for one day
I
I can remember
Standing by the Wall
The guns shot above our heads
And we kissed
As though nothing could fall
And the shame was on the other side
We can beat them
Forever and ever
We can be heroes
Just for one day
We can be heroes
We can be heroesEmbed
