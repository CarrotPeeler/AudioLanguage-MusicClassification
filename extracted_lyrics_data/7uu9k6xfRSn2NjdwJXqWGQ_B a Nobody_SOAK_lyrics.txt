7 ContributorsB a noBody Lyrics
The teenage heart
Is an unguided dart
We're trying hard
To make something of what we are
Dying trapped between
The main blanket and new sheet

We'll never amount
To anything

Come on, come on (come on, come on)
Be just like me
Come on, come on (come on, come on)
Be a nobody
Come on, come on (come on, come on)
Be just like me
Come on, come on (come on, come on)
Be a nobody, oh

You ring, you ring a bell to show
You're bleeding
I watched, I saw your mind fall
Out of your head
Weekends and cheap thrills
Risk it all for an inch of fun
You might also like
We'll never amount
To anything

Come on, come on (come on, come on)
Be just like me
Come on, come on (come on, come on)
Be a nobody
Come on, come on (come on, come on)
Be just like me
Come on, come on (come on, come on)
Be a nobody, oh
Be a nobody, oh

Oooooh
Oooooh
Oooooh
Oooooh

Come on, come on (come on, come on)
Be just like me
Come on, come on (come on, come on)
Be a nobody
Come on, come on (come on, come on)
Be just like me
Come on, come on (come on, come on)
Be a nobody, oh
Be a nobody, oh

Come on, come on
Come on, come on
Be a nobody
Come on, come on
Be just like me
Come on, come on
Be a nobody2Embed
