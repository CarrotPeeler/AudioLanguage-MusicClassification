5 ContributorsNot The Way That I Do Lyrics
She might be the type to let you run all over her
But that's just not that way I do
Believe me if I let you get a sniff of the whiff
You gon' do things the way I do
Better see what the hits you give
Before you try to make a pitch
Recognize why it ain't you
Only reason why I'm takin just what everybody give me
Cuz it just ain't the way I do

By the walk and the way I talk
What gave you the thought
The game many I loss
By thinkin' you false
Too many girls in the house
With heart strung out
Complain when they running they mouth
But they like me
Sayin just enough
I ain't gotta ever do
Settling is takin' you home
I ain't in it for the minute
No pass lives and gimmicks
Next time that ya see me
You'll see why the niggas love me

She might be the type to let you run all over her
But that's just not that way I do
Believe me if I let you get a sniff of the whiff
You gon' do things the way I do
Better see what the hits you give
Before you try to make a pitch
Recognize why it ain't you
Only reason why I'm takin just what everybody give me
Cuz it just ain't the way I do

Ain't the way I do thangs
I do
Ain't the way I do thangs
I do
Ain't the way I do thangs
I do

What's the reason you keep telling me
You want me
Bets believe that's you know how we get down in the country
In the streets they know I'm a beast but
Bud Please ain't no Pimpin'
No p-i-mping at me
So much for treating' me like her
Like her
I'm bout to keep it deeper what
How long are the violins gonna play
They don't follow no instructions
They just do what I say
She might be the type to let you run all over her
But that's just not that way I do
Believe me if I let you get a sniff of the whiff
You gon' do things the way I do
Better see what the hits you give
Before you try to make a pitch
Recognize why it ain't you
Only reason why I'm takin just what everybody give me
Cuz it just ain't the way I do
She might be the type to let you run all over her
But that's just not that way I do
Believe me if I let you get a sniff of the whiff
You gon' do things the way I do
Better see what the hits you give
Before you try to make a pitch
Recognize why it ain't you
Only reason why I'm takin just what everybody give me
Cuz it just ain't the way I do

I just wanna see
What it be?
Is it slick?
And it's raised only in the country
It is thick?
It is somethin easy to get the lovin
But you'll see when you wind up lonely
Now if you know get into this is
Running' around ain't gon be you
Recognize why it ain't you
Only reason why I'm takin just what everybody give me
Cuz it just ain't the way I do
She might be the type to let you run all over her
But that's just not that way I do
Believe me if I let you get a sniff of the whiff
You gon' do things the way I do
Better see what the hits you give
Before you try to make a pitch
Recognize why it ain't you
Only reason why I'm takin just what everybody give me
Cuz it just ain't the way I do

Ain't the way I do thangs
I do
Ain't the way I do thangs
I do
Ain't the way I do thangs
I do

She might be the type to let you run all over her
But that's just not that way I do
Believe me if I let you get a sniff of the whiff
You gon' do things the way I do
Better see what the hits you give
Before you try to make a pitch
Recognize why it ain't you
Only reason why I'm takin just what everybody give me
Cuz it just ain't the way I doEmbed
