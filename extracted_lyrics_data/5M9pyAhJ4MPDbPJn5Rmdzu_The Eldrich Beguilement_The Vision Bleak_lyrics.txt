2 ContributorsThe Eldrich Beguilement LyricsIn the veil of the night I wandered about
At the bole of a tree it did light
I deemed it a stone at first glance, no doubt
Something in me was lured by its sight
First feeble and dim, but then it did shine
In shade and the colours of gold
Thither I hurried, no longer I strolled
Methought it was something divine
Firmly I grasped it and now I beheld
No precious did someone bequeath
I tossed it from me and I terribly yelled
...a skull with golden teeth!
First feeble and dim, but then it did shine
In shade and the colours of gold
That thing of aghast, it rolled and it rolled
Till it stopped at one place of malign
Led by a dream
By light deceived
Light-hearted, I strolled through the night
But what of the horror
Of that ghastly thing?
It is just a burial site...
God may know why I frantically graved
Where that death's head did cover the ground
But what did I see! Unsound and depraved
My remains and their burial mound
You might also likeLed by a dream
By light deceived
Light-hearted, I strolled through the night
But the horror
Of that ghastly thing
Did show me my burial siteEmbed
