8 ContributorsCherub Lyrics
Cherub
Cherub the angel
Roll back the hands of time
Cherub
Enter the angel

You walk alone now
You never mind
The walks you've taken
Have left behind
All people sideways
They look at you
May god forsake me
Cause I do, too

I see bodies
Maybe, maybe someone is alive
Naked
Naked this time
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
Naked
You might also like
You're right beside me
You gaze a view
Your body's vacant
They crawl right through
Those bodies falling
It's in the air
We're mixed so close now
But I don't care. Ah-ah!
Walk upon me
Your body lead
You try to escape you
It's in your head

Yeah. Yeah-hah
(unintelligible whooping)
Ha, ha-ha
Eee!!
Ch-k-ch-k-ch-k-ch-
(unintelligible whooping)
Ah-ah-ah!
...I'd better go back
I'm not over there
You walk beside me
You gaze at me
You're homeless now
Or that times three
Amazon
You gaze along
I'll make you talk you
There is no bong
Your mind has cut you
You're bleeding now
Your plans escaped
Just like a bow
They walk right past you
They stop and stare
Your body's lying
All over there
He-he-he-he-he!
Fu-Embed
