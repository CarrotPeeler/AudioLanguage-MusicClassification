1 ContributorThe Truth Won’t Fade Away Lyrics(Brooker / Fisher / Reid)
We were young, we were brave, we were true, we were strong
Far away the bombs an' the buildings explodin'
There was no way out
It was black, it was white, we had so much to say
Right or wrong... The truth won't fade away
We had our hopes, we had our dreams, we were young, we were old
We saw our future self-destructing: there were roles that we played
Some were good, some were bad: there was so much to say
Right or wrong... The truth won't fade awayYou might also likeEmbed
