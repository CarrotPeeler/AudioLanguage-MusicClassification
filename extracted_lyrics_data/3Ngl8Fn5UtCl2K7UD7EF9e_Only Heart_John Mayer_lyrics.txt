10 ContributorsOnly Heart Lyrics
Do not waste this evening
Baby, I'm begging you
Your big imagination's playing its tricks on you
If you think my up and leaving's something I'm going to do
Feel my chest when I look at you
Baby you

You got my only heart
Yeah, you got my only heart
Yeah, you got my only
Only heart

So hard to be so far out
Living our separate lives
Your phone was really broken
I tried your number twice
And if you need confirmation, baby I understand
It's alright if you want me to
Tell you you

You got my only heart
Yeah, you got my only heart
Yeah, you got my only
Only heart
You might also like
And you live like your hand's on the horn, baby
I adore you but there's a hole in the cup that should hold my love (hold my love)
If you let, if you let, if you let me leave
I swear I never will

Remember now
You, you got my only heart
Yeah, you got my only heart
Yeah, you got my only heart
Yeah, you got my only heart1Embed
