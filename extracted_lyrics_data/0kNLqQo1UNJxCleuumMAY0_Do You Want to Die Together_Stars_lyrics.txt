14 ContributorsDo You Want To Die Together Lyrics
I love you till the day I die
So don't die today, please don't die today
Everything but you is an ugly lie
That's not how you pray, that's not what you say
If I'm here when you're gone, I'll fall apart
Stop your crying now, stop your crying now
What's the point of life without my heart?
You're not dying now, you'll survive somehow

Do you want to die together?
Yes I do, yes I do
Do you want to die together?
Yes I do, yes I do
Do you want to die together?
Yes I do, yes I do
Do you want to die together?

It's been the night since you've been gone
Please, I have to go, please, please let me go
What's the use of writing one more song?
'Cause it's what you know, 'cause it's what you know
It was you and me, that's what you said
And it's always true, aren't I here with you?
I may look alive, but inside I'm dead
Then let's make it true, let's make it true

Yes I do, yes I do
Do you want to die together?
Yes I do, yes I do
Do you want to die together?
Yes I do, yes I do
Do you want to die together?
Yes I do, yes I do4Embed
