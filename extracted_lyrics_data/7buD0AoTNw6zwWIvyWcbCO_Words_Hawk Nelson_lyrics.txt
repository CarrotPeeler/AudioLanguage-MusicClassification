They've made me feel like a prisoner
They've made me feel set free
They've made me feel like a criminal
Made me feel like a king

They've lifted my heart
To places I'd never been
And they've dragged me down
Back to where I began

Words can build you up
Words can break you down
Start a fire in your heart or
Put it out

Let my words be life
Let my words be truth
I don't wanna say a word
Unless it points the world back to You

You can heal the heartache
Speak over the fear (speak over the fear)
God, Your voice is the only thing
We need to hear (we need to hear)
You might also like
Words can build us up
Words can break us down
Start a fire in our hearts or
Put it out

Let my words be life
Let my words be truth
I don't wanna say a word
Unless it points the world back to You (back to You)
Let the words I say (let the words I say)
Be the sound of Your grace (sound like Your grace)
I don't wanna say a word
Unless it points the world back to You (back to You)

Let my words be life
Let my words be truth
I don't wanna say a word
Unless it points the world back to You (back to You)
Let the words I say (let the words I say)
Be the sound of Your grace (sound like Your grace)
I don't wanna say a word
Unless it points the world back to You (back to You)
Words can build us up
Words can break us down
Start a fire in our hearts
Or put it out
I don't wanna say a word
Unless it points the world back to You1Embed
