1 ContributorAdd Your Light to Mine, Baby LyricsAdd your light to mine, baby
Add your light to mine
Add your light to mine, baby
Together we could shine
I've seen you dancing like no one was looking
Beneath the fullest moon
Oh some day soon
I'm gonna find all the things I've been yearning for
Are you coming too?
Add your light to mine, baby
Add your light to mine
Add your light to mine, baby
Together we could shine
All the rubbish that ever surrounds us
Could make a stone wall cry
But someday I'm
Going to leap out of this hole and you can too
If you're by my side
Add your light to mine, baby
Add your light to mine
Add your light to mine, baby
Together we could shine
You might also likeBaby you're so fine
Together we could shine
Add your light to mineEmbed
