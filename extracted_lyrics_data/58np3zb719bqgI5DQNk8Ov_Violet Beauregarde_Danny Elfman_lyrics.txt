(Oompa-Loompa! Oompa-Loompa! Oompa-Loompa!)
Work!
(Oompa-Loompa! Oompa-Loompa! Oompa-Loompa!)
Work!
(Oompa-Loompa! Oompa-Loompa! Oompa-Loompa!)
Yeah! (yeah)
Work! (yeah)

Listen close, and listen hard
To the tale of Violet Beauregarde
The gentle girl who sees no wrong
In chewing, chewing
Chewing, chewing
Chewing, chewing all day long

Chewing, chewing all day long
Chewing, chewing all day long
Chewing, chewing all day long

Yeah!
(Oompa-Loompa! Oompa-Loompa! Oompa-Loompa! Oompa-Loompa!)
(Oompa-Loompa! Oompa-Loompa!)
Yeah!

She goes on chewing till at last
Her chewing muscles grow so vast
And from her face her giant chin
Sticks out just like a violin

Chewing, chewing all day long
Chewing, chewing all day long
Chewing, chewing all day long

Oompa-Loompa!
Oompa-Loompa!
Oompa-Loompa!
Oompa-Loompa!

For years and years she chews away
Her jaws get stronger every day
And with one great tremendous chew
They bite the poor girl's tongue in two
And that is why we try so hard
To save Miss Violet Beauregarde

Chewing, chewing all day long
Chewing, chewing all day long
Chewing, chewing
Chewing, chewing
Chewing, chewing all day long
Chewing, chewing all day long
Chewing, chewing all day long
Chewing, chewing all day long
Chewing, chewing all day long
Chewing, chewing all day long
Chewing, chewing all day longEmbed
