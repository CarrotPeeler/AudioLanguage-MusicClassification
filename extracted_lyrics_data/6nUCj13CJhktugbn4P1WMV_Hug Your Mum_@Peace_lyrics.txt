13 ContributorsLast Letter To Cadet Lyrics
One last letter
Rest in peace, cuz
Yeah

Dear cuzzy, I don't know where to start
You know this broke my heart
The most broken I've been, I swear to God
When I got the news of your death, I started losing my breath
I tried to be the strongest around, but as soon as I saw your mum, I broke down
Be there for her, I'mma do just that
In less than a year, I lost you and Nash
That's my closest friend and my closest cousin
I had to ask God, like have I done suttin'?
Like, what did I do to deserve this?
This is what true hurt is
We had our ups and downs, but we built our relationship so perfect
I try stay strong, but your boy broke
I've replayed every vid, every voice note
I've been staring at your pictures for hours
My music career's now ours
'Cause everything that I do, is now in the memory of you
Nothing comes close to this pain
Trust me, you didn't die in vain
If you could ever see the love that you're getting
How much people you touched was a blessing
No longer underrated, you definitely died as a legend
One of the best storytellers in the country
And still switch it up and do bangers like Pumpy
Trust me, if they ever knew how much I love you and how much you loved me
You might also like
Cuz, please help me focus
This whole thing's just too hard to process
You were loved, just know this
The turn out at Hyde Park at such short notice
Nan was proud, dad was proud, mum was proud, sis was proud, bro was proud
I swear to God, the whole family was proud when they saw that crowd
My heart's so heavy, but I got pride so I won't tell anybody that I need the help
And the truth is, I do
I lost you, I can't lose myself
Last few months have been hell for your dad like
But you know he's a fighter, he's that guy
Strongest man that I know, the first time that you've seen your dad cry
That's my uncle, man I love you
I can't take no more, 'cause I'll crumble
And you two were fixing your problems
Were so close then you were taken from him
How much can one man take?
How much before this one man breaks?
All these stresses, all these pressures
Pray for me, I need blessings

Make sure you sort out any issues with your loved ones
Before God seals the deal
Your last words to me were literally "just know that I love you, for real, for real"
And I couldn't ask for anything better
I'll remember those words forever
I know it sounds mad, but since you passed, I can't listen to your letter
That'll break me, that'll finish me
I didn't get to say bye, and it's killing me
You knew I was proud, so that means a lot
You were even saving for a shisha spot
Just got your new crib, you were in it for a week
I was so proud beyond belief
You worked so hard, that's why my heart's aching
'Cause in a blink of an eye, it was taken
You know that I'm there for your dad
Mum, sisters, brothers and Roman
You know you got a brother in CJ
You know you got a brother in Konan
You know I been here for the fam
Since you been gone, that's been clear to the fam
And this shit's hard to believe, 'cause you're the other half of me
I won't let you down, cuz, I swore that
We're putting on a show for you and
Everyone's coming to support that
You're gonna see, everybody's got your back
Make sure the family stay strong
I'mma do what I gotta do
Say everything that I need to say in one track
Damn near impossible
I just wanna say a big thank you to everyone that's showing their support
As long as I live, I promise, cuzzy I'mma carry that torch
Cuz, this don't feel right
This just don't feel right man
Cuzzy, thank you for every bit of love we felt
Cuzzy, thank you for every single hug we held
Cuzzy, thank you for every single memory
Cuzzy, thank you for leaving this legacy
Cuzzy, thank you for all of the smiles you gave
Cuzzy, thank you for all of the smiles you made
Cuzzy, thank you for this part you played
Cuzzy, thank you for all the lives you changed

When the lights go low and the curtains close
And the crowd applaud and you know it's over
I tried to block it out, but the pain don't go
So I wrote this one just to let you know
I never will forget you
I never will forget you
I never will forget you
I never will forget you
When the lights go low and the crowd applaud
I never will forget you
Yeah, I never will forget you3Embed
