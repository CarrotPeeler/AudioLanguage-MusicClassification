4 ContributorsLaid to Rest LyricsYou didn't give me what I craved for
Why did you tease me with desire?
Now I'm hanging by a wire
Laid to rest
Laid to rest
Left me waiting in your darkness
Full of fear and full of pain
How can I ever be the same?
Laid to rest
Laid to rest
Laid to rest
Laid to rest
So I'm praying with devotion
That you take me for a ride
Let me fill you full of pride
Laid to rest
Laid to rest
Laid to rest
Laid to rest
Laid to rest
Laid to rest
Laid to rest
Laid to restYou might also likeEmbed
