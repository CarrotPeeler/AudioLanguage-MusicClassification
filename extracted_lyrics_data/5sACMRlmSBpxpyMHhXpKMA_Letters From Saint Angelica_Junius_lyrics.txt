3 ContributorsLetters From Saint Angelica LyricsWhy don't you come home
Why don't you come alone
Why don't you try
How'd you get lost
I want you to know
I will always decide to be by your side
Wait now, we want to find out why you won't...
Wake up
Wake up, dear sir (You're ready to go)
Wake up
Wake up, it's done
Go home tonight
She's waiting there all alone
I don't want to give up on life
So I'm spending my time in patient isolation
I've fallen so hard
Left the one I care about in the dark
It's nothing more than a selfish pain
I've kept for too long
It's time to let go
I'm on my way home
To get back what we've lost
You might also likeWait for me now
Waiting all night
Wake up
Wake up, dear sir (You're ready to go)
Wake up
Wake up, it's done
Go home tonight
She's waiting there all alone
Wake up
Wake up, dear sir (You're ready to go)
Wake up
Wake up, it's done
Go home tonight
She's waiting there all alone
"In this short period of time that I have, I hope to leave here some seeds, some ferment of thought, of skepticism, of new look at the universe, and what is in it."Embed
