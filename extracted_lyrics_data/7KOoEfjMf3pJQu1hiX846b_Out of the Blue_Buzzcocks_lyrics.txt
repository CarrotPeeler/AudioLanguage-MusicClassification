Something's wrong, I don't know what's going on
Just when I thought things were fine
Best left unsaid, the voices in my head
They contradict me all the time
I must confess, my life is in a mess
The best-laid plans of mice and men
And when they start to really fall apart
Can't stick them back again

Out of the blue, fate knocks at the door
I thought that you knew, but we've both been wrong before
Out of the blue, wish I could be sure
I hope that it's true 'cause you keep me wanting more
And more, and more

Don't get to choose if we win or lose
Is it all a game of chance?
I canâ€™t forget those feelings of regret
Instead of sweet romance
I wrote a song about how things go wrong
You think I would've learned by now
Time and again, it's driving me insane
You might also like
Out of the blue, fate knocks at the door
I thought that you knew, but we've both been wrong before
Out of the blue, wish I could be sure
I hope that it's true 'cause you keep me wanting more
And more, and more

Something's wrong, I don't know what's going on
Just when I thought things were fine
Best left unsaid, the voices in my head
They contradict me all the time
I must confess, my life is in a mess
The best-laid plans of mice and men
And when they start to really fall apart

Out of the blue, fate knocks at the door
I thought that you knew, but we've both been wrong before
Out of the blue, wish I could be sure
I hope that it's true 'cause you leave me wanting more
And more, and more

And more, and more, and more, and more
And more, and more, and more, and more
And more, and more, and moreEmbed
