Okay, you had sedatives and cold champagne
They say that must be the price of fame
It's not a joke if you can choke on the thought of it
You're not my friend to defend if you're loving it
So Kurt I heard that you squeezed somebody's hand
It doesn't hurt if you think about your fans

Kiro TV
They've got their visions again like it's oxygen
Kiro TV
They've got their visions again want your heroes dead

(It don't hurt if you think of the fans)
(It don't hurt if you think of the fans)

Okay, they've got your file down at the CIA
They say you're worse than Manson for the US of A
It's not grief if you can see through the source of it
It's only true if you're bruised by the force of it
So Kurt I heard that you opened up your eyes
They call it work but it don't make it civilized
You might also like
Kiro TV
They've got their visions again like it's oxygen
Kiro TV
They've got their visions again want your heroes dead

(It don't hurt if you think of the fans)
(It don't hurt if you think of the fans)

Okay, so time takes your cigarette
They say, it puts it in your mouth then you'll forget
No longer "live 105" - can you hear me
The life expectancy of any popularity
So Kurt I heard that the side show bet your life
It doesn't hurt at the worst go "Nevermind"

Kiro TV
They've got their visions again like it's oxygen
Kiro TV
They've got their visions again want your heroes dead

(It don't hurt if you think of the fans)
(It don't hurt if you think of the fans)Embed
