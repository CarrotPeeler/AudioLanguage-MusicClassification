Bitch, I'm outlandish
Might go and travel to Paris
Going straight up like I'm Travis
I'ma go see all the world
Be inside all the girls
And unlike my man, Derek, I'm savage
Bitch, come through
Who the hell talking to you?
Who been telling you that you can do
What you been doing?
Man has been so off that goop
That I'm worried, I hurry to move
Bitch, I'm outlandish
Might go and travel to Paris
Going straight up like I'm Travis
I'ma go see all the world
Be inside all the girls
And unlike my man, Derek, I'm savage
Bitch, come through
Who the hell talking to you?
Who been telling you that you can do
What you been doing?
Man has been so off that goop
That I'm worried, I hurry to move
You might also like
Shaking, I'm making the place go insane
So they talking about all the damage, ay
I'm basically owning the whole of the game
And I dunno if they really 'bout it, ah
They crazily flexing upon me
Like I ain't been tellin' em bout all that madness, ay
And I ain't a star but I'm going so far
In a couple more years, I'll be Travis, ah
There's smoke in the trap as they smoking the green
Unloading the bags, I'm fulfilling their dreams
I'm mixing the tracks as I master my craft
And I'm sure that they all 'gon be loving the sweet
Shit I cook up in the mo'fucking booth
Spitting like Danny but keeping the tooth
I meant keeping the teeth, on that Ultralight, b
Give my music a Chance, give my music a peep

Bitch, I'm outlandish
Might go and travel to Paris
Going straight up like I'm Travis
I'ma go see all the world
Be inside all the girls
And unlike my man, Derek, I'm savage
Bitch, come through
Who the hell talking to you?
Who been telling you that you can do
What you been doing?
Man has been so off that goop
That I'm worried, I hurry to move
Money make bitches do crazy shit
I got the money to say this shit
I got the burner, I'm tossin' it
My teeth clean, no need for flossin' 'em
Been had the skill, been had the hate
Been had the love, and I been pushin' weight
If you see me, jus wait, know that you gon' get yours
I got my verses, don't even spit yours
How the hell you sayin' you a savage?
How the fuck you claimin' you a bad bitch?
Whoever got the nina stop cryin'
Niggas out here been wilin'
I got the dope tucked right beside my sock
So if you got a problem, you'll get problem solved
I've seen niggas get to all the cabbage, get ravaged
Then take it out on all the average
(you're gonna do the hook)

Bitch, I'm outlandish
Might go and travel to Paris
Going straight up like I'm Travis
I'ma go see all the world
Be inside all the girls
And unlike my man, Derek, I'm savage
Bitch, come through
Who the hell talking to you?
Who been telling you that you can do
What you been doing?
Man has been so off that goop
That I'm worried, I hurry to move
I'm going crazy, then I stop
I told ya pay me, the fetti the guap
Let's go get faded, I'm ready to pop
There's no explaining, they're sending the cops
Lights 'n sirens
Life expirin'-
My environment-
Invite the violence
I know that you ain't got a lot to say
I know that you jus' gonna run away
I don't want proof, gonna shoot til there's nothin to spray
I'm up in ya face so ya fucked either way
The beast has been damaged
Releasin' a savage
Your queen gettin' ravaged
You're mean to me and at least that's the average
Seekin' advantage
Grievin' has vanished
The weak get abandoned
See the obscene in a dream-
It's the seeds that we planted
We gettin' banished
Kid c. in a mansion
Outlandish!

Woah, I just might kick back and chill
I just might click back and kill, woah
I am not taking that pill
I don't need drugs for a thrill, no
I'ma sign off on this deal
I'm gonna climb up the hill, yeah
I don't help and I do this myself
All these rappers are slackers for real, yeah
Revving shit up when I'm tearing it up
I'm getting wavey, I fill up my cup
I think I'm crazy I need a checkup
I'm getting lazy enough is enough
If she slide in my dms, I link her my cloud
And I don't fuck with her til she knows all my sounds
Play all my shit through your speakers aloud
Then I flex that bitch

I'm outlandish, yeah
Flex on that bitch
I'm outlandish, yeah
Flex on that bitch

I smell the aroma of lit marijuana
We got it, we robbed it from the boul on the corner
I'm walkin' down market, we smellin like resin
We stop to buy dutches at seven eleven
I bark at some boul just to get a reaction
And when he ignores me, I go and attack him
We all riding deep with them blades, you can't Fathom
The size so illegal but they can all stab 'em
Hakeem Olajuwon
You ain't gettin off the hook
Red iris, I can't open up my eyelids
Tabs of LSD rollin' with the extras
I'm wearin dirty jeans but homie, we the next up

Bitch, I'm outlandish
Might go and travel to Paris
Going straight up like I'm Travis
I'ma go see all the world
Be inside all the girls
And unlike my man, Derek, I'm savage
Bitch, come through
Who the hell talking to you?
Who been telling you that you can do
What you been doing?
Man has been so off that goop
That I'm worried, I hurry to move

Bitch, I'm outlandish
A motherfucking artist
Paint my picture on the canvas
I heard this beat so I had to do damage
I saw that bitch so I had to take advantage
Wasn't born a savage but I grew to be one
Looking at your son and he looks like me
So it's very likely that that's my son
It wouldn't be the first one
This bitch is acting crazy so I grab my gun
Ooh, grab the shots
I just smoke a lot of pot
I won't ever fucking stop
The prophecy it needs me
Me, I'm just conceiving
Different type of thoughts
Hey, I'm taking all these shots
Yo, rest in peace to Pac (Perfect)
On the next level, taking dabs with the devil
I'm more raw than fucking several
Of you combined, I stab you fools
In your fucking spine, now you're paralysed
You couldn't flow better if you fucking tried
Battle me but you won't survive
I'm stuck in the seventies, I look like Hyde
Cause I'm always high
I'm looking for a blunt that I can buy
A blunt to spark, a blunt to light, I never write
This was freestyled like all my songs
Staying strong but I'm staying calm
I drop that shit like a fucking bomb
Hiroshima, I believe ya
Shoutout to Koma, I smelled the aroma
Kill you and I smoke that doja

Fuck the law, crunk with claws
Through eroded jaws in a moped drawl
OPEC stalls in a suction
Hail to the function-one can erupt with a drunk fist
Tungsten punks running the Tron-Bikes
Off of the bumpers that crash with the Klondikes
Crystal balls, Newton's Cradle
Is to fall to the stables
Stapled stasis, sold for a sable
Seesaw maiden astray toward the made-men
Mainly a manger of maces and
Maize mice maundering makeshift to mayday
Cheese moon out of clay pulls some sunlight
Cunt's like "where's the blunt strike?" Our house
Thunk right out a scroll written upside:
Life is a joke and the pope is the tongue bite, yah

Bitch, I'm outlandish
Might go and travel to Paris
Going straight up like I'm Travis
I'ma go see all the world
Be inside all the girls
And unlike my man, Derek, I'm savage
Bitch, come through
Who the hell talking to you?
Who been telling you that you can do
What you been doing?
Man has been so off that goop
That I'm worried, I hurry to move

I'm tryna live in a palace
And sip from a chalice
And count out the money
Ttil I get a callous
Papers I roll
They made out of gold
They looking like records
That these rappers have sold...me
I'd rather go diamond, they see how I'm shining
Wearing my albums as if they're medallions
She call me a stallion, sloppy toppy in the Rari
Think that I'm the king like I brought the ring to Ohio
My chain, they got more links than you got links up in your bio
Gucci always told me don't get lost up in the sauce
But when you live this life just know it costs to be the boss, cuz

Bitch, I'm outlandish
Might go and travel to Paris
Going straight up like I'm Travis
I'ma go see all the world
Be inside all the girls
And unlike my man, Derek, I'm savage
Bitch, come through
Who the hell talking to you?
Who been telling you that you can do
What you been doing?
Man has been so off that goop
That I'm worried, I hurry to move

You give it a minute, I give it a while
Releasing my albums for free, I've gone wild
Disturbing my peace, you disturbing the beast
I'm outta control like K. Dot on the beat
I renegade shit like I'm s'posed to be doing
Outlandishly trapping, meanwhile I'm doing
The shit that you claiming goes hard, yeah, I do it
The bitch that you loving so hard, I'ma do it
You lot can call me the new GOAT
Achieving my dreams, I'ma get loads
Next summer, I'm gonna outdo Boat
I'ma just drop that new shit, I consume loads
The people I meet know I'm too cold
Drop in December, this time, I improve; gold
That contained.kinda.crazy, nah, I ain't been playing
I'm outta this bitch like a new child, c

Bitch, I'm outlandish
Might go and travel to Paris
Going straight up like I'm Travis
I'ma go see all the world
Be inside all the girls
And unlike my man, Derek, I'm savage
Bitch, come through
Who the hell talking to you?
Who been telling you that you can do
What you been doing?
Man has been so off that goop
That I'm worried, I hurry to move
Bitch, I'm outlandish

What you been doing?
Man has been so off that goop
That I'm worried, I hurry to move

I hurry, I hurry, I hurry to move
You going, you going, you off of the goop
I dunno, I dunno what you've been doing
Bitch, I'm outlandish
I kill it, I kill it, I murder the booth
Improving, improving, what you gonna do?
I'm in it to win it and that's what I do
Bitch, I'm outlandishEmbed
