1 ContributorAge Of Wizard LyricsSo far away from the eyes of reality
Rise the doorways of fantasy
Ride, man, in the valley of eternity
Where the lands are free from falsity
(PRE CHORUS)
Now the time has come to hear the bards
For a new horizon beyond sea of dreams
You'll see the dragons fly
And the dance of elves
In the lands of fairy lakes and falls
(PRE CHORUS)
(CHORUS:)
Runnin' dreams on the circle of the time
Under the sky of eternal life
Among the mountains, dressed of light
Over the scythe of pain
Let your mind fly away in freedom
Where mankind's thought will never die
Time, Lord of Life
In this place my soul is mine
Death, Bride of Time
The ideas will never fade

(CHORUS)
...where mankind's thoughts, lives again
(CHORUS)
...where mankind's thought will never dieEmbed
