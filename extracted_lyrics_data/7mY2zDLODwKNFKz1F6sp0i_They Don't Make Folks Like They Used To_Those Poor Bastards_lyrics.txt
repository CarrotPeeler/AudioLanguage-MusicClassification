1 ContributorThey Donâ€™t Make Folks Like They Used To LyricsI like old time country songs
More than women, more than GOD
But I do not believe that makes me evil
Every time I go to town
I pay the whores, I make the rounds
But I do not believe that makes me evil
For the world has become a disease
You can do what you want if you please
The world has become a disease
Now I'll admit I take cocaine
I drink Old Crow most everyday
But I do not believe that makes me evil
I do not work, I do not save
Desperate women pay my way
But I do not believe that makes me evil
For the world has become a disease
You can do what you want if you please
The world has become a disease
And I don't believe
They make folks like they used to
Everyone's so easy to replace
You might also likeI do not sleep, I do not dream
Everyone's a ghost to me
But I do not believe that makes me evil
Bolt your doors and hide your wife
I'm coming to your town tonight
But I do not believe that makes me evil
For the world has become a disease
You can do what you want if you please
The world has become a disease
And I don't believe
They make folks like they used to
Everyone's so easy to replaceEmbed
