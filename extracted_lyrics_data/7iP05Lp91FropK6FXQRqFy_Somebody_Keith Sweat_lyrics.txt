3 ContributorsSomebody LyricsWhen I walk in the room
You hurry up and hang the phone up
Girl why don't you tell me
(Who is that somebody?)
When I'm makin' love to you
You act like your mind is somewhere else
Rather than on me
(Who is that somebody?)

Is there somebody
(Who is that somebody?)
I know you been ugh, ugh with somebody
{who is that somebody?)
Is there somebody
(Who is that somebody?)
I know you been ugh, ugh with somebody
(Who is that somebody?)
When you come home 6 in the morning (oh yeah)
Acting like its alright
(Who is that somebody?)
Then you wanna flip the script on me girl (flip the script on me, yeah)
Then we argue fuss and fight
(Who is that somebody?)

I love you, c'mon and take my hand
Started out it was cool, too good to be true
I was good to you baby and you was good to me to
When I was caught up in the bad you found the good in me to
And the cheatin' type, it wouldn't, couldn't, shouldn't be you
And when it comes to the lovin' that I gave (nobody)
Could ever to the wonderful things I did to your (body)
You confessed I was the best to caress your flesh
And pressed her with the S all you could say was yes
But I guess your ex made a harder impact
Caught you cakin' at the mall its like you want him back
Nowadays all you do is lie to me, probably tired of me
My woman, you ain't gotta be
I tried to be your friend but I gotta go off intuition
Our relationship is a play, it needs an intermission
Drifting on memories when our love was strong
But baby I can reminisce alone
What wrong with my mind (whats wrong, whats wrong)
Whats come over me?
(Who is that somebody?)
Whats wrong with my ears
Theres a seed in me
(Who is that somebody?)
Whats wrong with my mind (whats wrong, whats wrong)
Whats come over me?
(Who is that somebody?)Embed
