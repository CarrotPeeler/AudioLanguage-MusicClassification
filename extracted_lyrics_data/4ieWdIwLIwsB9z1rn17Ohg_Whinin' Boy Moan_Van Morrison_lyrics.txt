3 ContributorsWhininâ€™ Boy Moan Lyrics
Drop that coin right into the slot
Get it whether you're ready or not
Let the whinin' boy moan
Let the whinin' boy moan
Let the whinin' boy moan
If you don't know how to do it yourself

Well, they call him Mr. Jellyroll
Just the way he rolls his dough
Let the whinin' boy moan
Let the whinin' boy moan
Let the whinin' boy moan
If you don't know how to do it yourself

Well, well, well, let the whinin' boy moan
If you don't know how to do it yourself
Let the whinin' boy moan
If you don't know how to do it yourself
'Cause he can do it better
Better than anyone else
Whine, whine, whine, whine

All the winos down on Market Street
Roll on over to old North Beach
Let the whinin' boy moan
Let the whinin' boy moan
Let the whinin' boy moan
If you don't know how to do it yourself

Well, he gonna sing and play for you
Exactly what he's supposed to do
Let the whinin' boy moan
Let the whinin' boy moan
Let the whinin' boy moan
If you don't know how to do it yourself
Whine, whine, whine

Let the whinin' boy moan
If you don't know how to do it yourself (Give me that whine, man)
Let the whinin' boy moan
If you don't know how to do it yourself
'Cause he can do it better
Better than anyone elseEmbed
