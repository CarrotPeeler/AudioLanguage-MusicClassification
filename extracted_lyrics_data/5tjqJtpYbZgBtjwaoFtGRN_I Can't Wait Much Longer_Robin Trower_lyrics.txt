2 ContributorsI Canâ€™t Wait Much Longer LyricsThere beneath the diamond sky
Caviar and the moon light wine
She has'nt yet made up her mind
If she'll take me
See my love it's stoned indeed
Got my future at your feet baby
The simple life ------!
You can take me
And every day gets stronger
Everyday it grows and grows
I can't wait much longer
Round and round in dreams I go
Set me free baby or tie the bow
Up or down let me know
!!! oh dont ignore me !!!
And everyday gets stronger
And everyday it grows and grows
I can't wait much longer
Get my coat and I'll catch the train
Make my way down to new orleans
Tryin to save -----!
Oh to console me

Everyday it grows and grows
I can't wait much longer
And everyday gets stronger
Everyday it grows and grows
I can't wait much longerEmbed
