5 ContributorsSleeping Dogs LyricsWell I'm not trying to get in the way
Minding my own, got nothing to say
About nobody, that's right nobody
Don't shake my tree, don't rattle my cage
You and me will be on the same page
Got no trouble, don't make no trouble
Yeah you best let the sleeping dogs lie
'Cause soon you gonna understand why
You gonna get bit right between the eyes
Well let me tell you how it all went down
Funky little joint on the edge of town
Called a Pine's Pub, old Wayne had had too much
Well push come to shove, and it came to blows
Spill some blood and I broke his nose
Yes I had to do it, mama that's all it was to it
Now you best let a sleeping dogs lie
'Cause soon you gonna understand why
And you gonna get bit right between the eyes
Said you best let a sleeping dog lie
Come on yeah
Make no mistake let there be no doubt
Paint me in a corner I'll fight my way out
The moral of the story brother this is it
I'll be all over you , like stink on shit

Soon you gonna understand why
You gonna get bit right between the eyes
If you don't you let the sleeping dogs lie
You best let a sleeping dog lie
'Cause soon you gonna understand why
You gonna get bit right between the eyes
Said you best let us sleeping dogs lieEmbed
