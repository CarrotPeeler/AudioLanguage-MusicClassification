1 ContributorRight Here LyricsAnd I'm not here so you can play around
Fight your battles on someone else's ground
And we're through, is to be free
And I don't want you hurting me
And it's taken time, so much time for me to understand
And I'm so strong now
I'm standing proud (standing proud)
And why should I share with you now
When you won't share with me

What goes around, comes around, goes around
Right here
Comes around

What goes around, comes around, goes around
Right here
Comes around

Right here
What goes around, comes around, goes around
Right here
Comes around
Right here
Right here
What goes around, comes around, goes around
Right here
Comes around
