6 ContributorsCathedral Lyrics
I'd like to see you just one more time
Give or take an inch or two, now, what's the crime?
The dogs tore into him until
There was nothing left except for what was left
I imagine that's not much

I'd like to be your cathedral
To feel all the people
Swelling inside me
I'd like to be your cathedral
To feel all the people
Maybe the time isn't right
Maybe the time isn't right
Maybe the time isn't right

She ripped it open with a plastic knife
I'd been waiting for something like that for all my life
You push your buttons, lock your doors
Your velvet screens, they don't love anymore
It's the way that you see it, it's what you see

I'd like to be your cathedral
To feel all the people
Swelling inside me
I'd like to be your cathedral
To feel all the people
Maybe the time isn't right
Maybe the time isn't right
You might also like
They beat her black and blue
They would have done me too
If I'd have stuck around
I'm a stranger in this town
They beat her black and blue
They would have done me too
If I'd have stuck around
I'm a stranger in this town

I'd like
(Beat her black and blue)
To be your cathedral
(They would have done me too)
To feel all the people
(If I'd have stuck around)
Maybe the time isn't right
Maybe the time isn't rightEmbed
