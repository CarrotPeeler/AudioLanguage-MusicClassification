2 ContributorsYes I Am LyricsI am tired, yes I am
I'm a coward, yes I am
Now I understand
How long I've been a canting woman
You say that something's wrong
Today, and many more, will come
And though I really longed
I want you to leave me alone
I had to ask my friends
Our excuses never end
I'm just a lazy, bored adult
So seldom there are good results
I think about this all the time
I can't admit how bad it rhymes
'Cause I want you, yes I doYou might also likeEmbed
