7 ContributorsThe Telephone Always Rings LyricsIt must be wonderful to live like you do
To have respect from everyone that you know
To have surprises waiting outside your door
When you come home to answer your telephone
He who knocks is he that missed
The 'Don't Disturb' sign on the door
And he who called, is he that dropped
Invitations on the floor
Sitting down and switching on
The wooden box, the door is locked
Switching off the world outside
The party's over for the night
It must be wonderful to live like you do
To have respect from everyone that you know
To have surprises waiting outside your door
When you come home to answer your telephone
The telephone starts to ring, it rings
The 5-piece doorbell starts to chime
The liquid clock burst into song
It's out of tune, the timing's wrong
It must be wonderful to live like you do
To have respect from everyone that you know
To have surprises waiting outside your door
When you come home to answer your telephone
You might also likeIt must be wonderful to live like you do
To have respect from everyone that you know
To have surprises waiting outside your door
When you come home to answer your telephone
Lying down and soaking in
The bubble bath, the door is locked
Switching off the world outside
The party's over for the night
It must be wonderful to live like you do
To have respect from everyone that you know
To have surprises waiting outside your door
When you come home to answer your telephone
It must be wonderful to live like you do
To have respect from everyone that you know
To have surprises waiting outside your door
When you come home to answer your telephone
It must be wonderful to live like you do
To have respect from everyone that you know
To have surprises waiting outside your door
