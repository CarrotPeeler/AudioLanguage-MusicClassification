1 ContributorDusk Lyrics (x16)
Running out

My soul turns dusk
Corroding, leaving it alone to rust
Sorrow be giving reasons to adjust
Thinking of suicide, but not in a rush
Trust I won't give into none of my thoughts
If I died, nothing I did lessen cost
I'm just a lost and found, yes they forgot
Maybe my corpse would be good in a broth
Cause at least then I would become useful
Deja vu, die because I choose too
Nailed it, please fix your crew soon, dude
Sail ship, past it, quick, bitch who's you
Nothing you told me was the fucking truth, you know
I cannot handle this constant abuse, you know
If i could, bitch id perpetually shoot, you know
Knock you unconscious, then hang you on noose, you know
Thought we had an understanding, a truce, well now
How long will you continue with this rouse, you know
Maybe I should just stay a recluse, you know
I am not Kool, Aid, since I lost the juice, you know
All of the pain digs deep down like they're roots, I bet
You don't how hard it is to endure
Come visit, you will see me on the floor
Blood spattered, no pattern, suicide was ensured, shh

Running out

When I'm feeling better, I'ma get so energetic
Probably cause the last thing I saw was the gates of heaven
I remember putting a bullet in my head, it was embedded
Everything was crushing on me, but now I don't sweat it
Luckily I never took a single sedative, believe me all i ever did was a single hit of medicine
Adderall and Xanax was only issue at hand, I'm walking around earth a ghost, or better yet a phantom
Man this is just like a fantasy, afterlife, can't find it simply
Now I'm looking back at the reasons of why I used to bleed
Guess it was better to end it fast, then be hanging up 2 feet
Do you see, what I mean, lot messier, but it's fine with me, obviously
Did it, didn't blink, really indecent to think I can cease agony, easy to release life energy
Your soul, acquired
My soul, retired
Starting a fire for the shit I heard
Running for miles
Stuck in denial
Because I'm locked in emotional trials
Unzip the file
That's full of typos
Then I rename it "it's all my fault, I know"
It's always try, fail
Memorize "I fell"
Day, night seem like a nice taleEmbed
