12 ContributorsLotus and the Jondy LyricsWalkin' through the forest
Straight trippin' in the darkness
Straight up seein' goblins
Where no need to be frightened
Then I go grab the ice cream
Kinda stuck in my day dreams
Night time turn to day dreams
Then in walks in the Jondy
Lotus and the Jondy (x14)
