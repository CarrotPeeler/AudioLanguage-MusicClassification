12 ContributorsBig in Japan LyricsI got the style, but not the grace
I got the clothes, but not the face
I got the bread, but not the butter
I got the window, but not the shutter
But I'm big in Japan
I'm big in Japan
Hey but I'm big in Japan
I'm big in Japan
I got the house, but not the deed
I got the horn, but not the reed
I got the cards, but not the luck
I got the wheel, but not the truck
But hey, I'm big in Japan
I'm big in Japan
But hey, I'm big in Japan
I'm big in Japan
I got the moon, I got the cheese
I got the whole damn nation on their knees
I got the rooster, I got the crow
I got the ebb, I got the flow
I got the powder, but not the gun
I got the dog, but not the bun
I got the clouds, but not the sky
I got the stripes, but not the tie

Hey ho they love the way I do it
Hey ho there's really nothing to it
I got the moon, I got the cheese
I got the whole damn nation on their knees
I got the rooster, I got the crow
I got the ebb, I got the flow
Got the sizzle, not the steak
Got the boat, not the lake
Got the sheets, not the bed
Got the jam, not the bread
But hey, I'm big in Japan
I'm big in Japan
I'm big in Japan
Hey, I'm big in Japan
I'm big in Japan
I'm big in JapanEmbed
