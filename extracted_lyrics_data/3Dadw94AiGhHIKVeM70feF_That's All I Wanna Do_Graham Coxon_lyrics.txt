6 ContributorsThatâ€™s All I Wanna Do Lyrics
I saw you today, you were too far away
It'd hurt me to say, hurt me to say
The words, the words I have to say

There ain't no sound when you're not around
And it gets me down, yeah it gets me down
My life feels so brown

I just want to be with you, that's all I wanna do
I just want to be with you, that's all I wanna do


Inside my brain, it's just not the same
Cause it's started to rain, it's started to rain

I just want to be with you, that's all I wanna do
I just want to be with you, that's all I wanna do
