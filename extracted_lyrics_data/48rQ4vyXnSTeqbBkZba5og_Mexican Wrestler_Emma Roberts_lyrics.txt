A fallen angel who visits your dreams
And in those dreams I'd blow you a message that says
You really want me
Sometimes I wish that I was a wrestler a Mexican wrestler
In a red vinyl mask and I might grab you and body slam you
And maybe cause physical harm
When we would land I might take pity on you
I could crack all your ribs but I can't break your heart
You will never love me
And this I can't forgive
That you will never love me
As long as I will live
Sometimes I wish that I was a beauty
A beautiful girl, the popular one
And I'd turn your head and your friends would love me
And I could afford to play hard to get
We'd go to parties and you'd show me off
Then I'd go out with your best friend
You will never love me
And this I can't forgive
And It will always bug me
As long as I will live
You will never love me
Why should I even care
It's not that your so special
You're just the cross I bear
You will never love me
You will never love me
And this I can't forgive
And it will always bug me
As long as I will liveYou might also likeEmbed
