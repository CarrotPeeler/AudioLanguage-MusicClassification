3 ContributorsA Place Nobody Can Find LyricsYes, we're goin' out tonight
We ain't gonna tell nobody where
Gonna forget about the party lights
Just me and you, lovin' there
I'm gonna talk sweet talk
And tell you that you're mine
At a place nobody can find, yeah
Nobody can find, yeah
Oh, we'll burn this candle light
And if you get cold, I'll just squeeze you tight
We'll be together day before day
It takes so long to overcome your lovin' ways
I'm gonna talk sweet talk
And tell you that you're mine
At a place nobody can find, yeah
Nobody can find, yeah
We're gonna keep lovin' company
Everywhere we go, yeah
For your lovin' we need a secret hole
Where they can love, love, yeah
Where they can love, love, yeah

We ain't gonna tell nobody where
I'm gonna talk sweet talk
And tell you that you're mine
At a place nobody can find, yeah
Nobody can find, yeah
I'm gonna squeeze you
I'm gonna tease you
At a place nobody can find, yeah
Nobody can find, yeah
Nobody can find, yeahEmbed
