1 ContributorSkinny Love Lyrics
February days are good for nothing but split lips
A winter spent exhausted but sleepless
But I've always heard it called a problem
When someone does something alone
So I'll just
Keep spinning "...Further West"
And I'll get
My five hours a night at best
At least if I don't wake up in the morning
My head can't start hurting

So here's to waking up shaking
Balled up on the floor
Of an iced over winter Lake Superior
Raise a flag at half-mast
And a half-empty glass
In a toast to remembering what it's like
To not have to know she's sleeping somewhere else tonight

It's quarter past the third double blur on the right
And this apartment's pale, yellow lights
Are really bringing out the blue in the bags under my sunken eyes
I still can't shake this fucking cough
And I still catch myself way too often
Hoping that I only have to miss her
Till I finally find my way to sleep
You might also like
Well here's to waking up shaking
Balled up on the floor
Of an iced over winter Lake Superior
Raise a flag at half-mast
And a half-empty glass
In a toast to remembering what it's like
To not have to know she's sleeping somewhere else tonight

Well here's to waking up shaking
Balled up on the floor
Of an iced over winter Lake Superior
Raise a flag at half-mast
And a half-empty glass
In a toast to remembering what it's like
To not have to know she's sleeping somewhere else tonightEmbed
