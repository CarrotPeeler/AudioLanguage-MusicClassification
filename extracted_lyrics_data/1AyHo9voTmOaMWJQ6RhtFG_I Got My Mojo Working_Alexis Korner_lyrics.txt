Got my mojo working, but it just won't work on you
I wanna love you so bad till I don't know what to do
I'm going down to Louisiana to get me a mojo hand
I'm going down to Louisiana to get me a mojo hand
I want all you women jumpin' at my command
I got a gypsy women giving me a dance
I got a gypsy women giving me a dance
I got a whole lot of tricks I'm keeping here on ice
Got my mojo working
Got my mojo working
Got my mojo working
Got my mojo working
Got my mojo working, but it just won't work on you
Got my mojo working
Got my mojo working
Got my mojo working
Got my mojo working
Got my mojo working, but it just won't work on youYou might also likeEmbed
