I'm having myself a time
I mean I'm having what I want
Wanting what I have
Doing what I like and liking what I do
And I'm having myself a time
I never could save a dime
And so I'm living like a Lord, acting like a loon
Lying in the sun and sighing in the moon
And I'm having myself a lime

When I hum songs, they're all dumb songs
Without reason or rhyme
But I'm certainly in my prime
I mean I'm happy as a bird, flying up above
Want a little love and get a little love
And I'm having myself a time

But I'm certainly in my prime
I mean I'm happy as a bird, flying up above
Want a little love and get a little love
And I'm having myself a timeYou might also likeEmbed
