1 ContributorCry Freedom LyricsFreak flag, I fly
Now can you hear me calling?
Don't drag and justify
Or soon you will be fallin'
Last kiss, we hail
You're ready for transition
Sweet bliss, derail
In the red mist, we shall sail
Holy father, believe it's over
Cry freedom!
Dozen dawn, the last crusade
Cry freedom!
Many miles, many tears for soldiers
We're the last brigade
In the motorcade
Too deep, so wide
Too late to get some shelter
I leap, you glide
We ride the helter skelter
Moonbeam, starbright
A storm on the horizon
Bad dream, daylight
Like a diver in the dead of night
You might also likeHoly father, believe it's over
Cry freedom!
Dozen dawn, the last crusade
Cry freedom!
Many miles, many tears for soldiers
We're the last brigade
In the motorcade
Coat of armor upon your shoulder
Cry freedom!
Trail of blood, the last crusade
Cry freedom!
Many miles, many tears for soldiers
We're the last brigade
In the motorcade
Freak flag,I fly
Can you hear me calling?
Don't drag and justify
Or soon you will be fallin'
Last kiss, we hail
You're ready for transition
Sweet bliss, derail
In the red mist, we shall sail
Holy father, believe it's over
Cry freedom!
Dozen dawn, the last crusade
Cry freedom!
Many miles, many tears for soldiers
We're the last brigade
In the motorcade
Coat of armor upon your shoulder
Cry freedom!
Trail of blood, the last crusade
Cry freedom!
Many miles, many tears for soldiers
We're the last brigade
In the motorcade
Cry freedom!
Cry freedom!
Cry freedom!
