Heat so near in the shrouded gloom
Yields softly awaited burden
Dried scattered gentle noon
Slow in step, the wooded daydream
Breath so dear in the hovering doom
All too close, the patterned schadows
Suddenly still and towers alone
Slowly sets and times Sunday
Heat so near in the shrouded gloom
Yields softly awaited burden
Dried scattered gentl–µ noonYou might also likeEmbed
