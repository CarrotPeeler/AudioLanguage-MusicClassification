1 ContributorGive It Time LyricsYes I know it's a drag
It's a doggone shame
I've danced the same dance
Felt the same pain
I've heard the same thing and
I've done the same thing as you
Yeah you best believe me it's true
I've worn the same shoes
Walked the same walk at least a time or two
I've heard the same things
Done the same things as you
Give it time
Time that we're livin
It's easy to give in
But it won't do no good
Give it time
Things will get better
A change in the weather
It just might do you good
And believe at times finally lyin'
And all the good things I've had in mind
Misread the same signs
Ran the same line as you
And these holes in the soles of my worn out shoes
Have walked a million miles
Sang the blues
I don't need no other news
I'm done paid up in full just like you
You might also likeGive it time
Time that we're livin
It's easy to give in
But it won't do no good
Give it time
Things will get better
A change in the weather
It just might do you good
(bridge)
Give it time
Time that we're livin'
It's easy to give in
But it won't do no good
Give it time
And things will get better
A change in the weather
It just might do you good
You best believe me it's true
I've worn the same shoes
Walked the same walk at least a time or two
Heard the same things
And I've done the same things as you
Yeah I know it's a drag
It's a doggone insane
I've danced the same dance
Felt the same pain
I've heard the same thing and
I've done the same thing as you
Give it time
And things will get better
A change in the weather
It just might do you good
Give it time
Time that we're livin'
It's easy to give it
But it won't do no good
Give it time
Things will get better
A change in the weather
It just might do you good
Give it time
Time that we're livin'
It's easy to give it
But it won't do no goodEmbed
