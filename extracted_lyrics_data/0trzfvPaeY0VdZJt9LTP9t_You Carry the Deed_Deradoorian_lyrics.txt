2 ContributorsYou Carry the Deed LyricsWhat is the way to forget, solely
On what is what, when it is wanted only
Who is the one with the light on their shoulder
To carry love, to carry the burning
I know, I know it's you, oh
To carry the deed, let it go
Carry the deed, let it go
You'll always control, i know
I know it's you, oh
To carry the deed, let it go
Carry the deed, let it go
You'll always control
I know, I know it's you, oh
To carry the deed, let it go
Carry the deed, let it go
You'll always control, i knowYou might also likeEmbed
