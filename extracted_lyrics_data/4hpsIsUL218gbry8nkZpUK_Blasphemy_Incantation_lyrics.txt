1 ContributorBlasphemy LyricsUpon the sign of the night
Longing for a prophecy
Indulgence will prevail
The essence of humanity
Obliterate the trinity
Descending beliefs
Lord of lies, we defy
His purity, proven only lies
Decayed beliefs, twisted truths
Denounce your faith, we testify
Obliterate the trinity
Descending beliefs
His vanquished image
The sign of suffering
BLASPHEMY
Obliterate the trinity
Descending beliefs
Weakness in all his essence
We will triumph
In Blasphemy
You might also likeBLASPHEMY
Now pure and excruciating
Enduring in perpetual anguish
We will prevail in Blasphemy
