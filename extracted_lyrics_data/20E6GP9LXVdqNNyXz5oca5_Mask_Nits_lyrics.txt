4 ContributorsNo Wundah (The Projects) Lyrics(Intro)
Shit, I had some good times in the projects, shit, you could fuck the chick downstairs, dont nobody would know it, all kind a shit be goin on in the projects
(Hook)
Dreams of cream, a dime piece and a Lex
Up in staircase where our toughts connect
Niggas gettin shot for a lack of respect
No wonder where we live is called the projects
Dreams of cream, a dime piece and a Lex
Up in the staircase where our toughts connect
Break in your mailbox and take your checks
No wonder where we live is called the projects
(Verse 1)
Now these days, in the PJs
Niggas in C-ways, To get yours
Laughing at you as the trees blazed
For three days, the cops came around harrasin
Askin, who robbed the store with the ski mask n
Its funny, givin speed knots
Outside a weed spot
Chicks walk by in reeboks
For three blocks
These niggas ran into this kid named stan
With the bless in his hand, I knew what he was thinkin
I hear the sirens and see the lights blinkin
Before he blessed em, I heard he made em
Take off his minkin
The plot thickens, lifeless
Hes not kickin, He used to hustle
And brag on how he pulls chickens
With quotes from Charles Dickens
Lookin at him layin on the floor made my stomach sicken
Listen, where your worst enemy could be your best man
Envious to be the next man
In the lex land, havin

Dreams of cream, a dime piece and a Lex
Up in staircase where our toughts connect
Niggas gettin shot for a lack of respect
No wonder where we live is called the projects
Dreams of cream, a dime piece and a Lex
Up in the staircase where our toughts connect
Break in your mailbox and take your checks
No wonder where we live is called the projects
(Verse 2)
Yo, some people go three locks on their doors
Stoppin elevators between the floors
"Stop! Watchu doin? Can't get off my drawers!"
"I keep my mouth shut hon, and you keep yours"
With cats with gats who claim official
And found Sonny and his honey
In the range, covered in brain tissue
Whats the main issue?
Niggas playin for keeps
I guess he didn't have time to reach the heat
Under his seat
But yo he knew the rules in the trenches
Now the old ladies whisper his name, sittin on the benches
Its ironic
Shorties cuttin school, puffin chronic
? Like a masonic, niggas is on it
Dreamin of a kilo
But for now its just Cee-Lo
Four hundred and fifty six ways to get from bee low
Shinin, sippin Wray & Neph Overproof
Makin faces at the cops across the street
On the roof, havin
(Hook)
Dreams of cream, a dime piece and a Lex
Up in staircase where our toughts connect
Niggas gettin shot for a lack of respect
No wonder where we live is called the projects
Dreams of cream, a dime piece and a Lex
Up in the staircase where our toughts connect
Break in your mailbox and take your checks
No wonder where we live is called the projects
(Verse 3)
Now some of yall will go to college
Some will go to the rock
Some will catch concurence
Some will skate on shock
Some niggas is real and stay strong in the spot
Some niggas is wuss and busted you from down the block
Like your man Louis
Who got amped, like a sansoui
Playin with folks thats grown
Shouldve known, holdin your own can be an asset
When niggas get lumped up
For makin trumped up ass bets
Spend dough, Send vex to win yo
Better move, somebodys throwin shit out the window
True that, nosey hoodrats
Sayin who dat, brought me the taddle
But you know i never do that
Screw that, them kids shouldve knew that
Niggas shoot at outsiders, who walk by
Lookin cute at
But yo, I guess thats how it gotta be
Dice games and robberies, till i hit the lottery, uh
(Hook)
Dreams of cream, a dime piece and a Lex
Up in staircase where our toughts connect
Niggas gettin shot for a lack of respect
No wonder where we live is called the projects (Come on)
Dreams of cream, a dime piece and a Lex
Up in the staircase where our toughts connect
Break in your mailbox and take your checks
No wonder where we live is called the projects...Embed
