Through my heart
Cold wind blowing
Through my heart
The game is over
You win
I lose
Got a cold wind blowing
Through my heart
Cold wind blowing
Through my heart
The game is over
You win
I lose
Coming down
On the wrong side
Coming down
On the wrong side
Of love
I see your smile
On rainy days
Spray painted on clouds floating by
I can see you smile now
Twisting in a cold wind

Through my heart
Cold wind blowing
Through my heart
The game is over
You win
I loseEmbed
