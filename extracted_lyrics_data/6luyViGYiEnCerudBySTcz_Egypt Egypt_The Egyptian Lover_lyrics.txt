15 ContributorsEgypt, Egypt (Album Mix) Lyrics
Egyptian Lover
Egypt, Egypt, Egypt, Egypt
Egyptian Lover
Egyptian Lover, baby
Egyptian Lover
Egyptian Lover, baby
(Egypt, Egypt)
(Egypt, Egypt)
(Egypt, Egypt)
(Egypt, Egypt)

Give me a freaky kinky nation
With a total female population
I can deal with that situation
I don't care about my reputation
Give me a freaky kinky nation
With a total female population
I can deal with that situation
I don't care about my reputation
I'm The Egyptian Lover, sexy senior
It's not just a name, it's an adventure
I mix so fast, I scratch so sweet
There's not another DJ on Earth who can compete
You know it (I want you), Egyptian Lover
You might also like
Egypt is the place to be (Egypt, Egypt)
Egypt is the place to be (Egypt, Egypt)
Egypt is the place to be (Egypt, Egypt)
Egypt is the place to be (Egypt, Egypt)

Pyramids are oh, so shiny (Egypt, Egypt)
The women here are oh, so cute (Egypt, Egypt)
The freaks are on the floor now (Egypt, Egypt)
Dancing to beats I compute (Egypt, Egypt)

(Egypt, Egypt)
(Egypt, Egypt)
(Egypt, Egypt)
(Egypt, Egypt)
(Egypt, Egypt)
(Egypt, Egypt)
(Egypt, Egypt)
(Egypt, Egypt)


Egyptian Lover, Lover, Lover, Lover, LoverEmbed
