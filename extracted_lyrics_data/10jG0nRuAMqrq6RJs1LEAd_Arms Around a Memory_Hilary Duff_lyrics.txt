13 ContributorsArms Around a Memory Lyrics
Hot sweats and cold sweaters
I feel a little lost since you've been gone
The blame helps me feel better
Until you run across the cloud I'm on
You're reaching for a hand that's in the past
On beaches where the sand has turned to glass
No television life could channel this love

You can't put your arms around a memory (ooh)
You can't put your arms around a memory (ooh)
And now I'm wishing you were here
As much as I wish you would disappear
So will you remember to forget me?
You can't put your arms around a memory (a memory)
Can't put your arms around a memory (a memory)
So will you remember to forget me?
You can't put your arms around a memory (a memory)

A lifeboat in dead water
A ship inside a bottle that we broke
And we lost our true colors
We opened every door until we closed
And I could feel you in my air tonight
Coming through the waves and satellites
But our city skies will never light up
You might also like
You can't put your arms around a memory (ooh)
You can't put your arms around a memory (ooh)
And now I'm wishing you were here
As much as I wish you would disappear
So will you remember to forget me?
You can't put your arms around a memory (a memory)
Can't put your arms around a memory (a memory)
So will you remember to forget me?
Can't put your arms around a memory (a memory)

Hot sweats and cold sweaters
I feel a little lost since you've been goneEmbed
