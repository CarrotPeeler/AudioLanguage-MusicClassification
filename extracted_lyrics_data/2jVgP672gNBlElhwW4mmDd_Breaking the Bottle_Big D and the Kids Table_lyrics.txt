2 ContributorsBreaking the Bottle LyricsStart the day!
Drink...
Oh! A bottle of wine down
Mid-day!
Drink...
Oh! A bottle of whiskey down
It makes no sense
You be telling us lies
You be telling us lies
You told us you're going straight
Now on the concrete with a busted face
Todd, please put down that whiskey bottle
Todd, put the lousy bottle down
Yes!
Too many nights, crashing your car
Your face looks like it's thirty-five
Rise up from the bug infested couch
You lose your girlfriend while you're killing yourself
You start fights that you can't win
You have a new developed sense of sin
I tell you, man, you have got to stop
All of your friends have left you now to rot
You might also likeDon't be telling us lies. (No!)
I think he's telling you lies. (Nuh-uh!)
See, wait, no, I saw him just last week
He left the city on his own to get clean
Todd, he's out back, he's breaking bottles
Todd's tossing lousy bottles down
Todd's finally breaking the bottle
Dirt, glass, and whiskey on the ground
Yes!
He's my friend!Embed
