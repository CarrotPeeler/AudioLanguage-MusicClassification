2 ContributorsRun to Your Mama LyricsOne, two, one-two-three-four
You've got to be mean, you've got to be tough
You don't need none of that pity stuff
You've got to be hard or else you'll be done
You have to take care of number one
Don't come to me if you're out on the street
I'll only tell you to get up on your feet
Don't come to me if you feel you are through
'cause I don't have the time to listen to you
Run to your mama, but don't come crying to me
Run to your mama, but don't come crying to me
You've got to be smooth, you've got to be rough
You don't need none of that pity stuff
You've got to be cruel, forget bein' kind
Or else they'll just take it and leave you behind
Don't come to me if you're down on the ground
If it's problems you've got, I don't need you around
Don't come to me if your luck is in doubt
'cause I won't even listen, I'll just kick you out
Run to your mama, but don't come crying to me
Run to your mama, but don't come crying to me
Run to your mama, but don't come crying to me
Run to your mama, but don't come crying to me, yeah
