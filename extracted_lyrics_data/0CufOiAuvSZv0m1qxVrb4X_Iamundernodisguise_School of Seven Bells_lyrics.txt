I am neither breather or speaker
I am neither walker or sleeper
I am neither sister, brother, son, or daughter
Solely in my chest is my heart, a drum of water

I am under no disguise, I am under no disguise
I am under no disguise, I am under no disguise
I am under no disguise, I am under no disguise
I am under no disguise, I am under no disguise

I am neither breather or speaker
I am neither walker or sleeper
I am neither sister, brother, son, or daughter
Solely in my chest is my heart, a drum of water

I am under no disguise, I am under no disguise
I am under no disguise, I am under no disguise
I am under no disguise, I am under no disguise
I am under no disguise, I am under no disguiseYou might also like1Embed
