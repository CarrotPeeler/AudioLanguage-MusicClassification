7 ContributorsGetting Scared Lyrics
Turn your ugly face
Are you so surprised to see me?
Yeah, I was your little childhood playground toy
And if I remember
Yeah, if I do remember rightly
I said the tables would be turned around, boy

Who's getting scared now?
Tell me, tell me how does it feel?
It feels so good from where I'm standing

The only times of my life
The sun was meant to shine for me
You made it pour down, pour down with tears of rain
And dug my pride with a knife
Encaged by your obsession with me
Time for some mental torture and screams of justified pain

So you're gonna chase me now, boy?
Yeah, you're gonna corner me now, boy?
You think you're gonna threaten me now, boy?
Well, somehow I don't think so
Yeah, you're gonna stamp me down now, boy?
Yeah, you're gonna crush me down now, boy?
You think you're gonna threaten me now, boy?
Well, somehow I don't think so

Who's getting scared now?
Tell me, tell me how does it feel?
It feels so good from where I'm standing, yeah
Yeah you're getting scared now, wow, piggy
Go ahead and squeal
It sounds so nice from where I'm standing


Who's getting scared now?
Tell me, tell me how does it feel?
It feels so good from where I'm standing, yeah
Yeah you're getting scared now, wow, piggy
Go ahead and squeal
It sounds so nice from where I'm standing

From where I'm standing
Who's getting scared?
Who's getting scared now?
Who's getting scared?
Who's getting scared now?
Who's getting scared?
Who's getting scared now?Embed
