3 ContributorsThree Sisters Lyrics
Sad time, sad nights, nine times nine
Witch's brew night, time on time
Eye of toad and toe of frog
In the stew goes tongue of dog
And the brinded cat doth mew
The hedgepig squeals and whines
Three sisters hand in hand
All chanting magic rhymes

Eye of bat and blindworm sting
Lizard's leg and swallow's wing
Root of hemlock, slips of yew
In the stew goes drops of dew
And the old war dog doth howl
The crow doth screech and scream
Three sisters hand in hand
All leaping for a dream

Sad time, sad nights, nine times nine
Witch's brew night, time on time
Eye of toad and toe of frog
In the stew goes tongue of dog
And the brinded cat doth mew
The hedgepig squeals and whines
Three sisters hand in hand
All chanting magic rhymesYou might also likeEmbed
