James
Don't forget yourself
When you're across the water
Those sirens sing songs of love
Do they know what you're made of?
'Cause it might not be across the water now
Be sure to pack a good alarm
To pick you up in the morning
To turn your head to things that may go wrong
And though the arms of a lover can be so comforting
We all need a little warning sometimes
James
Now love, I have seen you wear
Pulled over your eyes through a small tear
I have seen my best friend crying
5000 miles you wish to roam
And there you'll build a new home under the hot sun
But it is what your burning for now
Nobody wants to live alone
We all know it's better to share than to own
And though the arms of a lover can be so comforting
We all need a little warning
You might also likeNobody wants to live alone
We all know it's better to share than to own
And though the arms of a lover can be so comforting
We all need a little warning
Sometimes
