Tied in knots of blood stained ribbon
It's the saddest gift I've given
Don't ever look inside
I can't promise what you'll find

Happy Hallowe'en
On your life swear
You won't scream

By your urge do not be driven
For inside this box are hidden
Horrors best kept concealed
Blood will flow when they're revealed

Happy Hallowe'en
On your life swear
You won’t scream

Happy Hallowe'en
Are you ready?
Watch with me
While the freaks
And perverts come clean
Kill your image
Kill with me
Kill your image
Happy Hallowe'en
Are you ready?
Watch with me
While the freaks
And perverts come clean
Kill your image
Kill with me
Kill your image

Never take presents
From strangers
Or enemies
'Cause they come with defects
And pretexts
Now you owe me
Cos I know what you want
And I know what you need
And I’ll give it to you
So you owe me
Now you owe meEmbed
