6 ContributorsFace LyricsCome along with me on an acid trip
I'll take your mind to a terminal bliss
You're bound and gagged
Mother fuckers laugh
You shouldn't have stayed
With me last night
Despise the reason
She stayed the night
I swear she screamed
She screamed so softly
Rape
Days go by they last so long
She's still tired she wants to go home
I can't let her get away
I promise one day she'll pray for me
To forgive me for all I've done
"It ain't easy", that's what she said
I swear she screamed
She screamed so softly
Rape me
Don't let it worry
Rape me
Don't let it worry
Don't let it worry
I love the pain
I love the pain
Disgusted with myself
With all the wrong I've done
I can't imagine it was so much fun
Yeah, it lasted so long
The trip went on and on and on
And then she said to me
"Remember these words I say to be
I swear she screamed
She screamed so softly
Rape me
Rape me
You fucking disgrace
I love the pain
I love the pain
Rape me
I love the pain
I love the pain
I love the painSee Sevendust LiveGet tickets as low as $133You might also likeEmbed
