4 ContributorsDying Inside Lyrics
Long, fat, green
Love what you do
So young, must be nice
Roll first class
Limousine drool
Packed house every night

Hey, rockstar, got a cold beer?
Sure, you don't mind, do you?
Ain't life sweet?
Party nonstop, 24/7, cool

So proud would be your mother
Anything you want, pick your lover
From here looks so fine
My God, how your star shines...

Dying inside
Dying inside
Dying inside

Live your dream
Walk in those shoes
Trade with you anytime
Worldwide name
Freedom, much fame
Spinning gold song and rhyme
See Jerry Cantrell LiveGet tickets as low as $42You might also like
So proud would be your mother
Anything you want, pick your lover
From here looks so fine
My God, how your star shines...

Dying inside
Dying inside
Dying inside


My God, how your star shines...

Dying inside

Play, get paid
Couple sports cars
Sure, you done paid your dues
Big house, own
No boss, fun
Lucky fuck, wish I was you
So proud would be your mother
Anything you want, pick your lover
From here looks so fine
My God, how your star shines...

Dying inside

My God, how your star shines...

Dying inside
Dying inside
You're dying inside

Dying inside...

Dying inside...
Dying inside...
Dying inside...
