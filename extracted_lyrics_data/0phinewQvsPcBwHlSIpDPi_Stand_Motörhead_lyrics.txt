Stand, you can make it
Stand, you can take it
Stand, realise that nobody
Can break you, if you
Stand, you can do it
Stand, go right to it
Stand, nobody can do
A damn thing to you
But you can't stand, if you don't care
Can't stand, if you don't dare
Can't stand, if you're running scared
Forget you're blood and bone
Stand like you're made of stone
Stand on your honour
Stand, know you're gonna
Stand, they can't put
The creeping death upon you
If you stand, never move it
Stand, gonna prove it
Stand, gotta stand cause you can't
Stand to lose it
You might also likeStand, stand, stand like a rock
Stand, stand, you can stop their clock
Stand, stand, put them into shock
Stand, you better stand
Stand, stand together
Stand, yeah, you better
Stand, don't you know
That you can live forever if you stand?
One for all, stand, don't you crawl
Stand, if you stand
Then you deserve it all
If you can't stand
You make them the boss
Can't stand, it's a total loss
Can't stand, nail you to the cross
Forget you're blood and bone
Stand like you're made of stone
