1 ContributorBallad Of The Last Lions LyricsLong before our mothers bore us
Mighty lion roamed the forest
When they left, we sure were sorry
Don't be sad, you don't gotta worry
Cause the last lions never give up
The last lions
Oh, the last lions never will stop
The last lions
You don't gotta be no monkey's uncle
To see you're still in the same old jungle
Same old city, same old pavement
And the cats are coming back to claim it
Cause the last lions never give up
The last lions
Oh, the last lions never will stop
The last lions
Yeah, the last lions never give up
The last lions
Oh, the last lions always will rock
The last lions
Solo

The last lions
Yeah, the last lions never will stop
The last lions
The last lions never give up
The last lions
Yeah, the last lions always will rock
The last lionsEmbed
