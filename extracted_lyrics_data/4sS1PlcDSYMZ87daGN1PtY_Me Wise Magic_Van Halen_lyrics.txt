5 ContributorsMe Wise Magic LyricsI know what you're thinkin'
What you're thinkin' is easy to see
I know what you're dreamin'
I have those same dreams, whoa
Reach up to the feet of God
Lookin' for a sign
It was right here all the time, time, time, time
I am you and you are me
(Do you believe?)
Don't you trust me? Me wise magic
Ow, baby, hold on
(If you could see)
Through my eyes, me wise magic
Oh, hold on
I feel you breathin'
Don't you trust me?
I feel you agreein'
I know what you need, wow
Don't you lie
Just listen through me
My words, at best to you
A fortune coo-coo-cookie

(Do you believe?) Wow
Don't you trust me? Me wise magic
Yeah yeah, oh
(If you could see)
See through my eyes, me wise magic
A little zen headed your way
You'll get it halfway down the interstate
Four days from now, it all goes clear
A Buddhist riff for your inner ear
(Do you believe?) Wow
Don't you trust me? Me wise magic
Yeah yeah, oh yeah, whoa
(If you could see)
See through my eyes, me wise magic
Whoa, oh
(Do you believe?)
Tell me you believe, do you believe?
Whoa, yeah
(If you could see)
Me wise magic
(Do you believe?)
Me wise magic
(If you could see)
