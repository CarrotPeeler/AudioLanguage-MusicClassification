1 ContributorFeel So Bad LyricsFeel so bad, feel like a ballgame on a rainy day
I feel so bad, feel like a ballgame on a rainy day
Since I lost my baby, I shake my head and walk away
Sometimes I want to stay here, then again I want to leave
Sometimes I want to leave, then again I want to stay
Since I got my clothes packed, I'll catch a train and ride away
Yea-hey-yea
I'm tryin' to tell you people - try to tell you how I feel
I'm tryin' to tell you people - try to tell you how I feel
I feel so bad, yes I do - my baby she gave me a dirty deal, Oh yea
I feel so bad
Sometimes I want to leave - then again I want to stay
Since I've got my clothes packed I'll catch a train and ride away
Gonna ride away, gonna ride away
Gonna ride away, gonna ride away
I feel so bad, I feel so bad
I feel so bad, I feel so bad
Woo!
Whoa yea
I feel, I feel so bad
I feel, I feel so bad
I'm gonna ride away
I'm Gonna ride away
Gonna ride, gonna ride
