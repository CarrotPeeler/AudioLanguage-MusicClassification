"Lie, lie, lies everywhere," said the father to the son
Your peppermint breath going to choke him to death
Daddy watch your little black sheep run
He got kni-kni-knives in his back every time he opens up
You say, "He got to be strong if you want to be a man"
Mister, I don't know how you can have

Sweet dreams
Sweet dreams

Land, land of liberty, we're run by a constipated man
When you live in the past you refuse to see
When your daughter comes home nine months pregnant
With five billion points of light, you're gonna shine them on the face of your friends
They got the earth in a sling, they got the world on her knees
They've even got your zipper between their teeth

Sweet dreams
Sweet dreams
You say, you say, you say that you have them
I say that you're a liar
Sweet dreams
Sweet dreams
You might also like
Go on, go on, go on and dream
Your house is on fire
Come along now

Well, well, summer wind been catching up with me
"Elephant mind, missy, you don't have
You're forgetting to fly, darling when you sleep"
I got hazy lazy Susan taking turns all over my dreams
I got lizards and snakes running through my body
Funny how they all have my face

Sweet dreams
Sweet dreams
You say, you say, you say that you have them
I say that you're a liar
Sweet dreams
Sweet dreams

Go on, go on, go on and dream
Your house is on fire
Come along now
Sweet dreams
