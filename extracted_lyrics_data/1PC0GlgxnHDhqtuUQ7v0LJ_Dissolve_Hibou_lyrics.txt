I’ve known you, you’re a vanisher, you’ll go ahead
To the next, dear I’ll try my best to understand

You’ll be leaving the sun
And I’ll be closing my eyes
In the moment we’ll know
That nothing could change your mind

Could I say anything this time? Oh, love of mine
No excuse, you’re a human now, so make it known

You’ll be leaving the sun
And I’ll be closing my eyes
In the moment we’ll know
That nothing could change your mindYou might also like1Embed
