5 ContributorsDescent Lyrics
The descent from destiny by a dark deed done
Was disclosed in divination
Death of a dead man's son
Deranged, deprived delivery
Darkened his decor

Ever-loathsome, the executor's edict
Estranges he from himself evermore, no
Evermore

So soon the service
Sealed his fated strife
A sacrifice seduced
To save his threatened life
And cowardice nor commerce
Could call the child to cease
Though the cycle of criminal commissions
Could never co-exist with peace
He could count only on the combustion of his chamber
As he lay the child to the floor

Ever-loathsome, the executor's edict
Estranges he from himself evermore, no
Evermore

Never to neglect this night again
As naught for nuances extend
Nocuously numbing him into, into nullification
Never to neglect this night again
As naught for nuances extend
Nocuously numbing him into, into nullification
Nullification, nullification

Terribly taken by the task that transpired
Tonight a tantalizing new testament was acquired
Thundering upon his tormented heart
From temptation and treachery
His almighty teachings tore him apart
Tore him apart
Tore him apart
Tore him apartEmbed
