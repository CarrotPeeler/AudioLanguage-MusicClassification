4 ContributorsHello? Is This Thing On? LyricsSometimes you don't say nothing 'cause you got nothing to say
And sometimes you tell it all 'cause no one's listening anyway
And you don't know for certain but you think you might be a bore
Don't wanna be nobody's burden so you just hit the dance floor
'Cause the opportunities presented stop you dead, stuttering on the sentences
Small talk's asking questions that no one cares about what the answer is
Watching others' conversation from your place against the wall
You'd have something worth saying if you could only find a place in the bathroom stall
But remember when you come out don't you dare look inside the bathroom mirror
What is it what was it and does it even matter anymore?
Hey, am I making any sense at all?
Does anyone here speak English?
'Cause everybody's acting like I'm crazy
Hey, am I making any sense at all?
Is this thing on? Is this thing on?
And I must confess or maybe you've already guessed
The you is me, I made up the rest
And I must confess or maybe you've already guessed
The you is me, I made up the rest
(Shh) The voices in my head go "Doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo, do, do, do, do"
(Shh) The voices in my head go "Doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo, do, do, do, do"

And don't you know sometimes I could just kill for a good conversation
Hey, am I making any sense at all?
Does anybody here speak English?
