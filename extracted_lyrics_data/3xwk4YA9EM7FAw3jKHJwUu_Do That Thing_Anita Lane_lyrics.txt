You do that thing, that thing that you do
Well, do that thing, that thing that you do
I've got a high attraction for some tantric action
Do that thing, that thing that you do
Call me up on the erogenous zone
On the kundalini telephone and
Do that thing, that thing that you do
A little love potion, put it in motion
Do that thing, that thing that you do
Put a little sugar in my cup
Take your spoon and stir it up
Do that thing, that thing that you do
Do that thing, that thing that you do
Soup de Jour, Je t'adore
I want more, more and more
Fai quella cosa, quella cosa che fai
Fai quella cosa, quella cosa che fai
Do that thing, thing you do
Put some sugar in my tea
Take your spoon and stir it for me
Do that thing, that thing that you do
Do that thing, that thing that you do
Fai quella cosa, quella cosa che fai
Gli occhi belli, tesoro
Do that thing, that thing that you do
Do that thing, that thing that you do
Do that thing, that thing that you do
Do that thing, that thing that you do
Do that thing, that thing that you do

Je t'adore, I want more
Put it in motion with a little love lotion
Do that thing, that thing that you do
Put a little sugar in my coffee cup
Take your spoon and stir it up and
Do that thing, that thing that you do
Do that thing, do that thing
Do that thing, do that thingEmbed
