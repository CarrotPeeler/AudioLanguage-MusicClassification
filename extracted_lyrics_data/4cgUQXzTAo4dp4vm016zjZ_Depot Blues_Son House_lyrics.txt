(Bank Account Remix)
I´m ride or die in this shit
Since I´ve been a child I´ve been rippin on mics inna different styles on my shit
But then I was mentally ill inna clinic like I ain´t surviving and shit
Terra Nova, even when I wuz homeless
I had to sleeping on Bella Sofa
But I ride upon the riddim the badder the madder the grind a come hit
Mean (Mean)
Governor mi get up and I´m ready for whatever
I might pop a 9mm deh and a Beretta deh when i squeem
Pull up with a M16
From the money nuh comin in and the company robbin him and mi tell you a economy a mean...
Sorry, I´ve been tripping, it was all a dream!
But how you feed your daughter when you runnin outa water pon the scene?
What do you know bout miso soup and the ramen noodle and a empty fridge
What do you know bout sellin features and the baddest loops onto the wackest kids
Wha you know bout cyaan pay the heather
Now you sit pon the stove fi the flame on it
Wha uno know bout depression and vision
Bout packin a heather and slanging em bricks
See wha dem a know about the daughters watching tv on the screen and you can’t pay and it suddenly go switch off
I can never pay the bill cuz even though I got a dollar
Coulda never feedin family wid big props
Cuz the fuckin lobby and the fuckin economy get the price up
(but) Jah know di government a never gonna feed us
Fuck em know bout make it out the gutta but you gotta go back on a corner fi go sellin them bag a the weed cous´
(Look what you made me do Remix)
Sick a the Pack
Sick a the fucker try tinkin em rappin like pac
Sick a the fucker they packin the Mac inna back a the ac
But dem a nuh talkin bout pun´s
No mi nuh believin in Cops (No caps)
Pickin a "bucket-lobotomy pick" inna lab
Duppy the pack a the beginner
Bugger they tink mi nuh mekin it bad
(Ultrasound Remix)
Gucci Gang, Maga Gang, Incel, all a dem a Nazis dem
Fuckin up the truth a the liberty
You pree fi conspiracy and servin white supremacy
HUSH IN THE COMMENTS THEM...
Tell em ye not crazy...
But antisemitic and he ain´t got the answers sway
I´m my own producer yo
Mi nuh need a Dr Dre
I´ma joyner anybody when I´m on my fuckin...
Wait... old joyner...
(Winter blues/Litty Remix)
Welcome to the Iron Arms street
Buzz molotov and a "fire-clath" dweet
I run the game and dem liers a cheat
You roofy the gyal, dem a poisoned and sleep
And a poison dart dweet, mek a fire arm speak
Cuz mi chop it and knock it like I´m japanese
Dem a robot and puppet, dem wired pon field
So mi strapped with a rocket from I-man a creep
Shot a pop out the head out the hoodie
Family gonna call my niame out, leave em dead pon the zuki
Family gonna dressed up in black, like that gyal a whoopie
Leave a hole inna head like dem man a Owlie Boop
Now "anybody bulletproof"
Deh pon the backstreet
With a mic and black sleeve
Dem a mice in a trap-seat
Yeah dem tried but dem cyaan sleep
Cuz dem a nice but em rat, see´t
Dem a bitin of my voice and get a bite a the shark teeth
Get up on a riddim anybody gonna wiggle
Genna put it down like Big L: lyrically gun a nuzzle
Sorcerers apprentice with a magically empress
Teleportin, man him a portal, come fi eliminate a muggle
Gwaan like em a savage, dem a mess wid a legend
Dem a deh pon the senat
Your bredda gonna get up on the double
Ruffian Rugged a leave red dot pon your forehead
Like I´m a father from a hindugyal, a indian model
You see mi there juggle?
Struggling from... mi cyaan remember a time without sufferation
Anyone in the back a the club a depressed as fuck
So the genna gonna govern dem and
Line up anyone pon the land
Riot pon the factory son and the cottanage farm
Wid the monsanto plan cuz economy fall
And apocalypse come... so we gotta be strong
Bun a fire pon the commonwealth colony plan
Open any border leave the planet to the people
And give back wha uno takin a the coloniszed land
Dem say mi strange like tom hanks son
Ryan pon dem with the tom hanks gun
But anytime mi kill it, mi seh: two hands dung
A Jenny gonna wheel it when a don man come
Better gimi pom pom before one drop come
People hating on the web cuz dem a dun know none
Run come son
Get pon the riddim and kill em a dance, whole front ram
Wid the RAM PAM PAM!
And the boomboomratatataplamplam
And a good gyal tun into a bad gyal
And a hoodlumb never gonna get back and
She got keys in her hoodlamb on her way to london
London, Heathrow, Foxtrott, Uniform
Charlie, Kilo, Bloodclath, Pull it don!
London, Heathrow, Foxtrott, Uniform
Charlie, Kilo, Bloodclath, Pull it don till a bullet don
(Gnat Beat)
Mi bad, Jah know
European grimehead with the rastaflow
Pon a dancehall show
Mi seh man a roll deep from Jacques Cousteau
Mi nuh go sleep cuz the hustle won´t
Dis a one fi mi shottas inna Château d'Eau
Dis a one fi mi roccas inna bungalows
Buzz a camera shutter and riddim shut u know
(Mask On/Mask off Remix)
Children´ say no drugs... cuz
You cyaan even handle herbs like that
Stop the fuckin Perciseps
I been over Hill and the valleys
Gimi Their pills and the Molly
And I still gonna Merk em dead
Now anybody wonder wha happen to the governor
"Cold he really do dirt like that?"
"could he really do reverse like that?"
Could he really do burst like that?
Back off
Better get backup
Mask off
Governor mi aim fi the headtop
Ride upon the riddim and mi Killin their rapgod
Juggernaut a buk inna makula a the Black Op
Pun upon their bar deh never seen like a Sessquatsch
You comin for the genna wid the banger but I bun up inna booth till it black ark
Wussup wid the mumblin mothafucka they  huffin and puffin em Hatin on raggamuffin

You know how the fuck they wocka flockin...
Back off
Better get backup
Mask off
Governor mi aim fi the headtop
Ride upon the riddim and mi Killin their rapgod
Juggernaut a buk inna makula a the Black Op
Pun upon their bar deh never seen like a Sessquatsch
You comin for the genna wid the banger but I bun up inna booth till it black ark
I sound like Dax dawg...
Back off
Better get backup
Mask off
Governor mi aim fi the headtop
Ride upon the riddim and mi Killin their rapgod
Wussup wid the mumblin mothafucka they  huffin and puffin em Hatin on raggamuffin

I’m rockin and shutting upon the sucker
Deh chattin never saYin nuttin

Evel Knievel Genna gonna get up with a Block Punch Block
How many 45´s can a wood chuck chuck
If I chuck it on any fake chopper that suck
Fuck
(Isis Remix - lyrics)
Mask off, that’s word to JJ Bola
I don’t wanna be a man, cuz they rape enola
All a di gyal seh mi sweeter than Baby Yoda
But I don´t give a damn, I range no rover
I invite em fi mi dinner, bet I be eatin a body
Get the stake a holder, wi nuh play slave and owner
Peer shutdown like the "gay enola"
From mi nuh make it till tomorrow I´m cookin on baken soda
Yo u nuh really waan it wid a MC
Steadily buzz a coppa pon a MP
Dem under mi chainsaw, I´m under mi Sensi
Buzz another coppa mothafucka till the magazine a empty
Anybody hoppin on the drakeflow
I tun a fuckin city inna Wako
Ey bro well i never had a barcode like Brandy
Governor Lines outstandin
Marvelously like Stan Lee
Bullet, the bullet
I gotta pull it, they pull it
I gotta bully the bully I pudding him, like Selenskyi
Well a bredda made a household name
Gotta get up on dem, pull up daily like groundhog day´ing
Well i been falling and faded but I get up on a cloudy day
And a likkle suicidal deh deh round last may
(Snapple Remix)
Bullet pon your head deh like a poncho
Dem a stuck inna di bubble like em Ponyo
This is what we doin in the shadows
I kill anybody then I´m cleaning up the mess like Marie Condo (BUMBO!)
Water comin a the toilet, so the genna gonna sippin on the Brawndo
Anybody similar like John Doe
Now mi talkin to myself, I´m talkin to Gonzo
Well I gotta get up with a Bad tune
Tun a Party inna Orgy like in Parfume
Never had a bodyguard, but one shot enuff to buzz like Whitneys Bathroom
Divin deeper now they gotta bow like a Harpoon
Got em Spy´s /spice all around like on dune
You nuh buzzin uno payin fi the adds too
When I was a youngin I been killin inna kapu
You had to be a Monsune
Way before anybody fakin the funk on a tube
And anybody diggin all kind a trash...
Uno racoon?
Well i pull up pon the fucka regardless
If uno mentally retarded or uno heartless
When mi kill a slacker sucker gotta be concious
Talkin bout they evolve but they hoppin on genres
Dem a nuh waan it wid the governor, nuff said
I pull up pon em in the corn-bed like a bomb threat
Bredda I´m a wolf inna duck duck goose
Semi gonna buzz it and I chop chop deuce
(say hello to adele)
Genna gonna beat em wid a banger
Then i hit em wid a venom inna prime time!
Get em wid a hammer, then I kill em in a minute inna twilight
Beat em wid the hammer then i get em wid a banger
Then i hit em inna nine night
A nuh body get upon the level dem a copy my patterns
All over my lines: I-Spy, what do I spy?
Switch! Stitch! Stitch! Whoop!
I´m like Einstein equally two Mc´s
Dat thing outa spooky dreams
Stick em up inna gucci jeans
I dont wanna say hi to joyner
I just wanna say hello to adele (what?)
I just wanna chop everyday, send the guts to ya mail
Tell her: open the mail! (weird)

(Sriracha)
Move! Move back!
Who you? Def!
Did he coulda get a city to the map?
Kill a mothafucka wid a - tew tew - gat
Through you - brat
Buzz a hekler binochular inna fubu hat
Two shots left
They comin fi the governor but karma gonna bonx bad juju back
They comin of tombs of crack
I´m comin a Suku, Meth
You nuh wanna see the governor go Dr Evil like MINIMINIMINIMINIMEMEME
I´m a bad boy like P. Diddi
Now they wanna go home like E E.T
Bad man wi nuh drink PEE PEE PEE
Now they wanna talk of numbers, mi nuh RI RI RI

But I PEW PEW PEW in your weenie-nie
Bout the governor, mi kill dem all dead
Rise pon the riddim and a get a starlet
Hit em wid the mic than leavin stans dead
Road rocky a nuh silk like garnett
Kill a microphone kill a fuckin scarlet
Mi nuh talk johannson, man a leavin Amps dead
Anybody get upon the riddim but di whole a dem nuh waan it wid the motherfuckin Governor rugged
Fill em up!
Machato mocca the cup
Agony wakin em up
Sucka they fackin the funk

Tiakin away uno breath
Assimiliate inna sec

(Way to go Remix)
In the 90s I had a crush on Wednesday
Today i Feed my Bullys to the fishes send em elseway
Made it Way before myspace and a sendspace

Talkin a poppin models and champagne and selfmade
Label-slave (bio) made up like chemtrailEmbed
