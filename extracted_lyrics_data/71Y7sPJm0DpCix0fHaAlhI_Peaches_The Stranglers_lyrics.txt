21 ContributorsPeaches Lyrics
Strolling along minding my own business
Well, there goes a girl and a half
She's got me going up and down
She's got me going up and down

Walking on the beaches looking at the peaches

Well, I got the notion, girl
That you got some suntan lotion in that bottle of yours
Spread it all over my peelin' skin, baby
That feels real good
All this skirt, lappin' up the sun
Lap me up, why don't you come on and lap me up

Walking on the beaches looking at the peaches

Well, there goes another one just lying down on the sand dunes
I'd better go take a swim and see if I can cool down a little bit
'Cause you and me woman
We got a lotta things on our minds
You know what I mean?
See The Stranglers LiveGet tickets as low as $92You might also like
Walking on the beaches looking at the peaches

Will you just take a look over there?
(Where?)
(There)
Is she tryin' to get outta that clitoris?
Liberation for women, that's what I preach
Preacher man

Walking on the beaches looking at the peaches

Oh shit, there goes the charabanc
Looks like I'm gonna be stuck here the whole summer
Well, what a bummer
I can think of a lot worse places to be
Like down in the streets
Or down in the sewer
Or even on the end of a skewer

Down on the beaches just look at all the peaches
Down on the beaches just look at all the firm bodies
Down on the beaches just look at all the sunglasses
Down on the beaches just look at all the peaches
Down on the beaches just look at all the peaches
Down on the beaches just look at all the peaches
Down on the beaches

Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm
Mm, mm
Mm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm2Embed
