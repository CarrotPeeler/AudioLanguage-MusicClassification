5 ContributorsStep Child Lyrics
You know, in life, I come to find out that
There's a little bit of good, little bit of bad in everything
It's always some good people, always some bad people
Perfect example: I know some good gangbangers and some bad gangbangers
I know some good police officers and some bad police officers
So the moral of the story is, we gots to get some motherfuckin' understanding
Or else

All frowns, no smiles, no more Black on Brown
Let's get togethеr and show 'em how we get down
I hеard payback's a motherfuckin' nigga
That's why I'm sick of gettin' treated like a goddamn step child

What? Are you Black now?
You a activist, that's how you act now? (Ball your fists up)
You told 'em don't treat me like a step child
We all equal, you wanna help now?
My white friends ask me, "What's the problem?"
Y'all motherfuckers won't stop 'em (Don't do it)
Ever since they got the black powder
You could hear the screams gettin' louder
I'm a hundred percent positive that's not why they made it
So can go around the world killin' all the natives (Why you do it?)
You fast forward to the future
They callin' police and they still wanna shoot ya
Why they wanna knock us down
And wipe us out 'til we not around? (Where we goin'?)
You ain't no different than a slaver
Mass incarceration, it's free labor (Bitch)
You might also like
All frowns, no smiles, no more Black on Brown
Let's get together and show 'em how we get down
I heard payback's a motherfuckin' nigga
That's why I'm sick of gettin' treated...

Our Black queens was insecure about their lips
But now look who want 'em
Content about their tits
But now look who want 'em
Embarrassed about their hips
But now look who want 'em
Gluteus maximus
But now look who want 'em
Our culture is invaded, they steal and they take it
After we create it, they act like they made it
We accept it, embrace it, they get their hair braided
Make this slang into phrases, they imitate it
Look, officer, get your knee off my neck
Bitch, you don't see me resistin', why the fuck is you so upset?
You bring your problems to work 'cause your shit is fucked up at home
Since a kid you was racist, got bullied when you was young

All frowns, no smiles, no more Black on Brown
Let's get together and show 'em how we get down
I heard payback's a motherfuckin' nigga
That's why I'm sick of gettin' treated like a goddamn step child
Once we get on top, I'm fuckin' you over
And that's on Jehovah (On God)
Yep, I'm treatin' you colder
And fryin' yo' ass, and turnin' you over
See, I am a soldier
No mercy from me (No), this verse is for free
'Cause, I am the man
I'm shakin' your hand and takin' your land (My Lord)
With the help from the God
With me and my rod, let's end this facade (Blow it up)
Your world is corrupt
Motherfucker, your time is up

All frowns, no smiles, no more Black on Brown
Let's get together and show 'em how we get down
I heard payback's a motherfuckin' nigga
That's why I'm sick of gettin' treated like a goddamn step child

It may be time to let it burst
But first we gotta treat each other better first then get reimbursed
Yeah, we need a bag, big bag for our sweat and tears
Back pay, this owed for the last 400 years
Third generation soldier
G-Pops and Pops served their time overseas, mines was on the corner
Fightin' for the blue, goin' against the red
While the white part sittin' around collectin' all the bread
We can fight they wars but they won't fight for us
They gentrified everything so now they right with us
Yeah, next door neighbors askin' for favors
Actin' tense 'cause they unsure of our natural behavior
Thinkin' that we want revenge 'cause the way they enslaved us
But we peaceful, y'all the ones labeled us dangerous
Like we threw 'em in them cages for not knowin' how to act
It's like the pot callin' the kettle black, y'all niggas crazy
You want me to stop talkin' like this? Well, nigga, make me
They control the cash money so they think they Baby
Try to silence Nick for what he read out a book they wrote
Hmm, ain't that a slippery slope?
That's why I question everything that that history wrote
Time to repair everything that that history broke
Hit the clutch, get in gear, one foot on the gas
The other foot way deep in they ass, you understand me?
All frowns, no smiles, no more Black on Brown
Let's get together and show 'em how we get down
I heard payback's a motherfuckin' nigga
That's why I'm sick of gettin' treated like a goddamn step childEmbed
