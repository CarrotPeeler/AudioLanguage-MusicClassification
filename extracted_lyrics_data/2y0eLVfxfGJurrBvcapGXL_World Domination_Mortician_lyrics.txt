1 ContributorWorld Domination Lyrics
"First there was the collapse of civilization: anarchy, genocide, starvation. Then when it seemed things couldn't get any worse, we got the plague. The Living Death, quickly closing its fist over the entire planet. Then we heard the rumors: that the last scientists were working on a cure that would end the plague and restore the world. Restore it? Why? I like the death! I like the misery! I like this world!"

Horrid, Brutal Deaths
Rape And Mass Slavery
Barbaric Killing Spree
Heads Mounted On Stakes

Damnation Of The Earth
