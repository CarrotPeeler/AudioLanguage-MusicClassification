5 ContributorsShe’s the Only One LyricsShe's a butterfly
But she flies too high
She won't speak the truth
She don't make excuses
She don't seem to care
But you want her anywhere
'Cause she's the only one
She don't make the scene
But that don't change a thing
You just plan and scheme
You insist on dreamin'
She won't play your game
But it's all the same
Now she's the only one
She knows too well that she's the only one
She doesn't care if you're the lonely one
You want to say it's over, but it's just begun
She's the only one
She knows too well that she's the only one
She doesn't care if you're the lonely one
It's not the way you planned it
But she's really got you on the run
Your one and only oneYou might also likeEmbed
