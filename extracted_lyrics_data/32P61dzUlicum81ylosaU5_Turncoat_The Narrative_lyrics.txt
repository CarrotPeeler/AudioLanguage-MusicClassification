1 ContributorTurncoat Lyrics
Turncoat parents and the children that never arrived
Pawnshop rings and the road swallowed up by the sky
And though the static on the radio was signaling that this was the end
They still sang on just like lovers till the day they decided to be just friends
And never speak again
To keep from caving in

So baby this is freedom and you finally are out on your own
And you left in such a hurry but you'll never get away from this home
'Cause the kids they aren't happy
And I don't know how you thought they could be
What with all those misconceptions, it's a miracle that they were ever conceived
And they don't look a damn like me
But I'll still feign believe

So baby this is freedom
So baby this is freedom
So baby this is freedom
So baby this is freedomYou might also likeEmbed
