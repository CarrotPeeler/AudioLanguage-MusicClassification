18 ContributorsBurn Lyrics
"Don't look, don't look," the shadows breathe
Whispering me away from you
"Don't wake at night to watch her sleep
You know that you will always lose
This trembling, adored
Tousled, birdmad girl"

But every night I burn, every night I call your name
Every night I burn, every night I fall again

"Oh, don't talk of love," the shadows purr
Murmuring me away from you
"Don't talk of worlds that never were
The end is all that's ever true
There's nothing you can ever say
Nothing you can ever do"

Still every night I burn, every night I scream your name
Every night I burn, every night the dream's the same
Every night I burn, waiting for my only friend
Every night I burn, waiting for the world to end
You might also like
"Just paint your face," the shadows smile
Slipping me away from you
"Oh, it doesn't matter how you hide
Find you if they're wanting to
So slide back down and close your eyes
Sleep a while, you must be tired"

But every night I burn, every night I call your name
Every night I burn, every night I fall again
Every night I burn, scream the animal scream
Every night I burn, dream the crow black dream
Every night I burn, scream the animal scream
Every night I burn, dream the crow black dream

Dream the crow black dream
Dream the crow black dream
Dream the crow black dream
Dream the crow black dream8Embed
