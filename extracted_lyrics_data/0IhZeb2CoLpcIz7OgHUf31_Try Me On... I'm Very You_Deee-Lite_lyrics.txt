3 ContributorsTry Me On... Iâ€™m Very You Lyrics
Try me on, I'm very you

What's the real question in your mind mind mind
I'm inclined to ask you all the time time time
Do unto me as I want to do to you
Try me on, I'm very you

I can't read your mind
So you got to let me know all the time
How it feels for it to be real

Ooh you got me you got me you got me
Ooh you got me you got me you got me

I don't know what you do
(I don't know I don't know)
But I like it I like it
I like what you're doing to me

The sands of time fade into dark
Feel your pulse it's groove o'clock
A message to madness
Feel music that's realness
You might also like
I can't read your mind
So you got to let me know all the time
How it feels for it to be so real
How it feels for it to be so real

Ooh you got me you got me you got me
Ooh you got me you got me you got me

I don't know what you do
(I don't know I don't know)
But I like it I like it
I like what you're doing to me
I like it
I like it
Oh-oh-oh
I like it
I like it
Oh-oh-hey
I like it
I like it
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I like it
I like it
Oh-oh-oh-oh-ohEmbed
