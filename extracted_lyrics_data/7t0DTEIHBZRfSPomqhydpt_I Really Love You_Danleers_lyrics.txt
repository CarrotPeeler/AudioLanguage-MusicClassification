From the album ‘Indoor Garden party – The Musical’
This beam, this solid beam
Starts beneath my feet
And breaks the pavement of the street
And rises,  till the skies are covered
And the weather disappears
Everything that grows in light
Expires in the endless night
Safety first just sounded right
Here it is in operation
We live at the centre of a cushion
Nothing troubles us too much
The beams have done their job as such
There’s only you and I to touch
We are surrounded and protected
All other stimuli rejected
We have created our own planet
Where only two hearts man it
The point is our love
Has turned to paranoia
Anything that tries to reach in gets shut out in the foyer
When I said I’d love you always
I really didn’t mean I would destroy you
Look at what has happened
Our lives have become tiny
You live in my pocket
And I live in your rosary
You might also likeTiny little people afraid of really loving
Of shouting and of kissing
Dancing under pouring heavens (Heaven)
Staying up all night and being fascinated
Searching through the streets of Rome
For something classic but R rated
Driving a thousand miles with no underwear between us
Touching skin and loving sin and brushing off the dangers
Feeling every breath that flows from the inside to the sky
And letting sparkles dance when we look into each other’s eyes
(Heaven)
This beam this solid beam
The beam that once protected
Now it only blinds us
I’m going to take you outside now
In the hope that raindrops find us
I’m going to love yours alone in a crowd of well kissed faces
And love you all head to toe in the warm and open spaces
And hope you still love me
When it’s me you really seeEmbed
