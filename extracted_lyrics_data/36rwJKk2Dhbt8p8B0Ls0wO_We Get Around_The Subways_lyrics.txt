2 ContributorsWe Get Around Lyrics
Haha

Yeah, like it or not
Gonna play the game
Fall down and fail the test
We won't complain
We take the shots
That's just our way
Put down the most dangerous bet
Or just forget our names

We get around
You can't drag us down
We've been around
You can't bring us
You can't bring us down

We've already lost
No-one else to blame
Beaten up by the best disease
It's a laughing shame
What more you got
What's more to gain
You're the saviour of rock 'n' roll (Haha)
You're just drunk on fame
Come on
You might also like
We get around
You can't drag us down
We've been around
You can't bring us
You can't bring us down

You try and turn your noses up as we walk by
We're sorry we're not that social
It's not like we're hanging round and wasting time
It's like we said we get around

We get around
You can't drag us down
We get around
You can't bring us
We get around
You can't bring us down
We get around
You can't bring us
You can't bring us downEmbed
