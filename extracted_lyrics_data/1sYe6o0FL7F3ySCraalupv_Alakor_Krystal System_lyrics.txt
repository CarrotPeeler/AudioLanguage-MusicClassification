1 ContributorAlakor LyricsYou should have found another land
Or chosen another gender
The day you were born
Alakor
You should have burried till the end
The secret of your ardor
The day you were loved
Alakor
You should have found another land
Or chosen another gender
The day you were born
Remember
The laughter of a child
The angels sound
When they turn off the light
But you're not down
Your smile before you hit the ground
No you're not down
You smile before you hit the ground
They're dead
And leaving in their dead world
They're dead
And leaving in their dead world
And leaving in their dead world
