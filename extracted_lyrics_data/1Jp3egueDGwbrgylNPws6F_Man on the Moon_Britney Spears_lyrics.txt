66 ContributorsMan On The Moon Lyrics
Dark mascara dripping down my face
Only fools could ever feel this way
Send my message into outer space
Wonder if it's gonna float your way

I can't compete with the stars in the sky
I'm invisible, invisible
I open the window to clear out my mind
But it's difficult, so difficult

Houston, I know there's a problem here
Must be a hole in the atmosphere
Baby, I wanna be closer to love

Patience, darling, wait for the night
Darkness comes and love comes alive
I've been right here dreaming of you
Waiting for my man on the moon
Moon

Last night I was in your arms so strong (It felt so good)
One small step and, baby, you were gone
Now there's meaning in the saddest songs (I just wanna cry)
All I do is cry and sing along (And cry, and cry...)
You might also like
Drinking alone in my party dress
Would you come back if I looked my best?
Put on a smile and I say to myself (I said it again)

Patience, darling, wait for the night
Darkness comes and love comes alive
I've been right here dreaming of you
Waiting for my man on the moon
Moon
Moon
Moon

I can't compete with the stars in the sky
I'm invisible, invisible
I open the window to clear up my mind
But it's difficult (Why is it so difficult?) so difficult
Château Mariott
Il m'amène au lieu du chevalier cet hivers
Cinq, quatre, trois, deux, un

Patience, darling, wait for the night
Darkness comes and love comes alive
I've been right here dreaming of you
Waiting for my man on the moon
Moon
