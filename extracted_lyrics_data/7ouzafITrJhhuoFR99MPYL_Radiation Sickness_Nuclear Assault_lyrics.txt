7 ContributorsRadiation Sickness Lyrics
Nuclear bomb
Has ruined your world
Flags of death
Have been unfurled
Nuclear doom
Has been unleashed
You've survived
And now you will die

Crawl through hell
That once was your home
Search for help
Through despair that has grown
You've not long
To live on this earth
You will die
Radiation shall kill

Shelter deep
Run and hide
There's no help
You will die (Die)
Shelter deep
Run and hide
There's no help
Woah!
You might also like

Fading thoughts
Your flesh shall rot
Life of pain
Is all you've got
There's no one
To bury the dead
People hide
Behind walls of lead

Shelter deep
Run and hide
There's no help
You will die (Die)
Shelter deep
Run and hide
There's no help
You will die

Die... slow... death
Die... slow... death
Die... slow... death
Die... slow... death!Embed
