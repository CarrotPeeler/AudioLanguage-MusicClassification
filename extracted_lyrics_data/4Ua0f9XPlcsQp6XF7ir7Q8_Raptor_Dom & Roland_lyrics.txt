Nigga what? Ah
Nigga, ah
Top up, from the raptor
Ah, nigga O's up, nigga what?
Nigga, ah, from the raptor
Nigga, ah
Nigga, ah, ah

Bitch nasty, shaking that butt
She a real one, totin' this gun
Ah, you nasty, you do what I want
F-fuckin' all night, 'till I say that we done
Do 'round, still making you cum
Put a gun to your shit, go dumb
Put a tec, but I got me a pump
Fell in love with the chop, and the gun
Only talk, but when you on the net
Where you at, when it's time to go step?
He survived, this time he a vet
Too many enemies, don't know who next
Ah, he got hit, now that energy left
Push up, he get put in a stretch
Free lil' Shaun, bro call him a tech
Free the , they down to go step
You might also like
When thеy think about who to be vexed (Niggas bе tight)
How the fuck he get left?
Bullets out, when it come out the tec
Fuckin' on cops, bullets rip through his vest
See the Jet's, bullets fly throught their chest
Bullets, bumpin' em, knockin' off flesh
Two guns, like it's Wild Wild West
I know niggas who died, got put up for less
Two dot's, tryna add their knock
Three man down, and we bendin' that block
Four hollows, five of them not
Roll up through six, better tell them to stop
I'm on seven, where is the thots?
, till he drop
Nine, ten or twelve in the Glock
Eleven years old, but I been gettin' guap

Bitch nasty, shaking that butt
She a real one, totin' this gun
Ah, you nasty, you do what I want
F-fuckin' all night, 'till I say that we done
Do 'round, still making you cum
Put a gun to your shit, go dumb
Put a tec, but I got me a pump
Fell in love with the chop, and the gun
Only talk, but when you on the net
Where you at, when it's time to go step?
He survived, this time he a vet
Too many enemies, don't know who next
Ah, he got hit, now that energy left
Push up, he get put in a stretch
Free lil' , bro call him a tech
Free the , they down to go step
Ah, too many enemies feelin' like Drake
I still party like Drake
Bottles, bitches, we makin' it shake
Doin' that dance, I'ma empty the safe
Dollar bills, all over the place
Ass shaking, I'm grabbin' the cake
Either go, or might go on a date
Pussy good, gotta give me a plate

When they think about who to be vexed
How the fuck he get left?
Bullets out, when it come out the tec
Ah, ah
Bullets, bumpin' em, knockin' off fleshEmbed
