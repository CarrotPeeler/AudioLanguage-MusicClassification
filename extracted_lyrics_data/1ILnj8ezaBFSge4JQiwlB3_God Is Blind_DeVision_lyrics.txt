1 ContributorGod Is Blind LyricsYou can't run away
From the lord's eternal game
Eat the dust
And kiss the book
Taste the wine of brotherhood
I don't want to hear the story
Of someone who lost his glory
Can you feel it too
Can you feel it too
I released myself from your grip
On my life
You lost all of your infallibility
Now, we're standing here
The more we have the less we give
Foul discord
Is what he sent
God is blind in the endYou might also likeEmbed
