6 ContributorsLove Gonna Pack Up (And Walk Out) Lyrics
Ooh, wow
We gon' fall
Ooh, wow
We gon' fall

We gotta get it together (Now)
Before it's too late (What are we waiting for?)
We just can't sit by (No, we can't)
And watch our love turn to hate
Doesn't really matter (No)
Whose fault it was

Love gonna pack up and walk out on us
Love gonna pack up and walk out on us

We act just like two kids and play
Get mad over something silly, take our toys away
It's too bad happiness don't grow on trees
That's why I gotta sacrifice for you, you gotta sacrifice for me
I gotta understand you, you gotta understand me
Doesn't really matter (No) whose fault it was
You might also like
Love gonna pack up and walk out on us
Love gonna pack up and walk out on us (While I remember)

We got this one life to live
One love to give
Let's kiss, oh
This is my lil' hug song
Put our 2s and 2s together
And let's love song
Face it, baby (Ooh, wow)
Pick up the pieces
(We gon' fall) Put it back together again
(We gotta get it together) Get it together
Or bye-bye, love, ooh

Love gonna pack up and walk out on us
Love gonna pack up and walk out on usEmbed
