2 ContributorsNew Man Lyrics
I never knew that I would feel this way about her
She was supposed to be a jump-off not a lover
She's got me doing things that go against the code
My homies look at me and say she's got you gone

I look in the mirror and I see a stranger
He looks like me but not quite me
If you think that's too deep
Girl, I can break it down, break it down

She makes me feel like a convict, fresh out of jail
I know it may sound crazy
But she's made me a new man, a new man, a new man
(Feel like a brand new man, oh)
Just like an alcoholic, one month out of rehab
No exaggeration, yes, she has
She made me a new man, a new man, a new man
(Feel like a brand new man)

She got me clearing all the numbers out of my phone
They be like, "Baby, where you at?" I tell them leave me alone
I didn't even see it coming
All I know is that I looked up one day and I

I look in the mirror and I see a stranger
He looks like me but not quite me
If you think that's too deep
Well, I can break it down, break it down

She makes me feel like a convict, fresh out of jail
I know it may sound crazy
But she's made me a new man, a new man, a new man
(Feel like a brand new man, oh)
Just like an alcoholic, one month out of rehab
No exaggeration, yes, she has
She made me a new man, a new man, a new man
(Feel like a brand new man)

I don't even walk the same, don't even talk the same
I'm different, she made me different
I don't even walk the same, don't even talk the same
Don't know what she did to me

She makes me feel like a convict, fresh out of jail
I know it may sound crazy
But she's made me a new man, a new man, a new man
(Feel like a brand new man, oh)
Just like an alcoholic, one month out of rehab
No exaggeration, yes, she has
She made me a new man, a new man, a new man
(Feel like a brand new man)
Brand new man
