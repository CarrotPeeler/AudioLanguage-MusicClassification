I found grace
If I lead or follow change my pace
I get tired lose my way
My lord he knows me every step of the way
My lord he knows me every step of the way
Every step of the way
I found grace
If I lead or follow change my pace
I get tired lonely lose my way
My lord he knows me every step of the way
My lord he knows me every step of the way
Every step of the way
I found grace
If I lead or follow
Change my pace
My lord he knows me every step of the way
Every step of the way
I found grace
If I lead or follow change my pace
I get tired and lonely lose my way
My lord he knows me every step of the way
My lord he knows me every step of the way
My lord he knows me every step of the waySee Mavis Staples LiveGet tickets as low as $105You might also likeEmbed
