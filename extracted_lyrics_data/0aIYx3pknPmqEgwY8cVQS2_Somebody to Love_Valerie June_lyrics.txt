Well, if you're tired and feelin' so lonely
You wake up at night thinking that only
If you had somebody
I'll be somebody
Your somebody to love

Did they tell you there are plenty of fish in the sea?
But you're out in the cold and you're feelin' empty
Looking for somebody
I'll be somebody
Your somebody to love

I'll be somebody, I'll be somebody
I'll be somebody , if you need somebody
I'll be somebody, I'll be somebody
I'll be somebody, if you need somebody
I'll be somebody, I'll be somebody
I'll be somebody, if you need somebody
Your somebody to love

Are you watching the moon risin' in the darkest of night?
Battered and broken 'cause you know it ain't right
You ain't got nobody, you ain't got nobody
Well I'll be somebody, I'll be somebody
Your somebody to love
You might also like
I'll be somebody, I'll be somebody
I'll be somebody, I'll be somebody
I'll be somebody, you can call on me
I'll be somebody, I'll be somebody
I'll be somebody, you can count on me
I'll be somebody, I'll be somebody
I'll be somebody, give you what you need
I'll be somebody, I'll be somebody
Your somebody to loveEmbed
