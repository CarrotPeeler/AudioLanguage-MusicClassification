4 ContributorsWage Slaves Lyrics
C'mon! C'mon! C'mon!

Scathing, attacks of time and torment
When we sleepwalk our lives away
These thieves, they've made our hearts break

So now, I'm, screaming
Attacks of heartless horror
At them, their cash can't kill us all
And now we have built we have
We have built upon their dream too long (for too long)
Don't be their fucking slaves!

We live in exploitation we have worked blind, endless means
They have turned our failure into what they need!

So break these shackles and take a stand
We are the gears
We are the ones they fear
Take their crowns, away
You might also like
They won't take away my life, a slave no longer
In my mind I break these shackles
And take a stand to tell the world
The revolt returns
Break these shackles and take a stand to tell the world
Get up!

We live in exploitation we have worked blind, endless means
They have turned our failure into what they need

Take it back
Take it back
Take it all back (Take it, Take it all back)Embed
