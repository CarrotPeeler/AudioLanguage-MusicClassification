7 ContributorsVillainy Thrives Lyrics
I can feel it aching within
Every bone inside me
I can feel it breaking out
Retaliation: released
I need to cause
The evildoers' suffering
Can't wait to choke the life
Out from your baneful bodies

If only I could afflict you
Hurt you in the same way that you hurt
I just want to exact reprisal
Retribution calls
The only way I depict you
Is that your redemption's undeserved
Meet the vessel of your reprisal
Retribution calls

It's not that I take life for granted
It's only that the good won't make it
Innocence dies
While villainy thrives

How can you harm a living thing
Thinking that it's your right?
How can you defile a life
Deprive it of innocence?
For too long, you have gotten
Away with murder
A fitting justice would be
Your painful execution

If only I could afflict you
Hurt you in the same way that you hurt
I just want to exact reprisal
Retribution calls
The only way I depict you
Is that your redemption's undeserved
Meet the vessel of your reprisal
Retribution calls

It's not that I take life for granted
It's only that the good won't make it
Innocence dies
While villainy thrives
It's not that I take life for granted
It's only that the good won't make it
Innocence dies
While villainy thrives

I want to ruin the rapist
Punish the criminal
Violate the abuser
End the murderer
I want to ruin the rapist
Punish the criminal
Violate the abuser
End the murderer


It's not that I take life for granted
It's only that the good won't make it
Innocence dies
While villainy thrives (Villainy thrives!)
It's not that I take life for granted
It's only that the good won't make it
Innocence dies
While villainy thrives (Villainy thrives!)3Embed
