In any clime
Where people like
A rockin time
And stay awake
Both day and night
Till everybody's feelin good an' right
Then throw me
(Smack dab in the middle)
I wanna be
(Smack dab in the middle)
I wanna be smack dab in the middle, people
So I can rock and roll to satisfy my soul
Ten Cadillacs
A diamond mill
Ten suits of clothes
To dress to kill
A ten room house
Some Bar B Q
And fifty chicks not over twenty-two
Then throw me
(Smack dab in the middle)
Oh, I wanna be
(Smack dab in the middle)
I wanna be smack dab in the middle, people
So I can rock and roll to satisfy my soul

With chorus girls
A street that's paved
With natural pearls
A wagon load
Of bonds and stocks
Then open up the door to Fort Knox
Then throw me
(Smack dab in the middle)
I wanna be
(Smack dab in the middle)
Ahhhhh, Smack dab in the middle
So I can rock and roll to satisfy his soul
Oh yeah!
A gang of bread and tons of meat
Oodles of butter and somethin sweet
A gallon of coffee to wash it down
Bicarbonated soda by the pound
Then throw me
(Smack dab in the middle)
I wanna be
(Smack dab in the middle)
I wanna be smack dab in the middle
So I can rock and roll to satisfy my soul
Then throw me
(Smack dab in the middle)
I wanna be
(Smack dab in the middle)
Yeah I'm gonna be smack dab in the middle, people
So I can rock and roll to satisfy my soul
So I can rock and roll to satisfy my soul
Smack dab
Yeah!Embed
