7 ContributorsMy Love Lyrics
Some girls just want to spend guys money (Yeah)
Live their lives chasing the milk and honey
Silver lives are their fantasy
But you're lucky 'cause that ain't me
Most girls think guys are all the same (Well)
Not you so I can take the blame (My mind)
I love you through the joy and pain
Even the coldest Georgia rain

See, my love is like an open sky (Open sky)
See my heart is like a river wide (River wide)
No, my world would never ever run dry
It runs over for you and I (You and I)
See my love is deeper than the sea
And sweeter than a pretty melody
So tell everybody that you're glad you've got me
You can trust in my love
My L-O-V-E (My love, my love, my)

Some think that love is just a word (Just a word)
Because of all the things they've heard (Things they've heard)
They think they're got to close their hearts
Can't see the light, the soul in the dark
But I know I got a real good man
Who loves me the best as he can (Best as he can)
That's why I'm here faithfully
'cause you'll do the same for me, oh now
You might also like
See, my love is like an open sky
See, my heart is like a river wide
No, my world would never ever run dry (Ever run dry)
It runs over for you and I (Oh, my love)
See my love is deeper than the sea
And sweeter than a pretty melody
So tell everybody that you're glad you've got me
You can trust in my love
My L-O-V-E (My love, my love, my)

You gotta go through
The fire (The pain)
The rain (The joy)
Take the joy and do it in pain
(Never give in) Give in
Don't give up (Don't give up)
They can try but it will never never break my love
Sweet, sweet love
Sweet, sweet love
See my love

See, my love is like an open sky (Open sky)
See my heart is like a river wide (River wide)
No, my world would never ever run dry
It runs over for you and I (Oh oh oh oh)
See my love is deeper than the sea
And sweeter than a pretty melody
So tell everybody that you're glad you've got me
You can trust in my love
My L-O-V-E (My love, my love, my)
See, my love is like an open sky
See my heart is like a river wide (A river wide)
No, my world would never ever run dry
It runs over for you and I
See my love is deeper than the sea
And sweeter than a pretty melody
So tell everybody that you're glad you've got me
You can trust in my love
My L-O-V-E (My love, my love, my), oh yeahEmbed
