I have to let you know that I'm really self-aware
I make some stupid faces
Especially when I'm in unfamiliar places
I'm sorta like, yeah right under your Facebook status
Right beside comment, look at the way I manage
Straight as an arrow but not that mannish forget your paradigms
I don't have to be a jerk to get a pair of dimes
Sipping on some Veryfine, feeling hella fly
I made some songs that my best friends dug
I'm Skeeter Valentine
Glad you have the time, get settled in the relax your mind
It's not as bad as I or you thinks
People these days are either too sensitive or insensitive
It depends on what the incentive is
They either know everything, if not they're ignorant
There's no in between, too many extremes ain't feeling it
Gotta switch a little bit
You gotta customize, you gotta customize (16x)
Why do I lack chill, I seldom have thrills
My situation really does deserve a laugh reel
Yall do not amuse me, I barely even laugh real
Jammin that Ayumi and I can't even stand still
Google search the name drop, never let this day stop
I bully scrubs in Melee till their mains drop and they drop
Tears like rain drops praying one day the rain stops
Fear humans I may not no matter what they may plot
And fyi to the people this may shock
Here's a piece of advice stop selling to Gamestop
I gotta drop gems not gray rocks
Gems like P.E. or NBA jocks
I'm looking for some new locations
Some valuable patrons
Some people that might wanna be more than acquainted
Sometimes I get real jaded I know my minds been tainted
And that's why every single day I'm trying to recreate it
You gotta customize, you gotta customize
When the real world fails you don't trust your eyes
That's the only way that we'll really be one of a kind
You gotta customize, you gotta customize, we have toYou might also likeEmbed
