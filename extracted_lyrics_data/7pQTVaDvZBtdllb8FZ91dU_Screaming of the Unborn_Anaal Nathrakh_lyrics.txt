Now I can hear the wretchedly
Now I'm free of the screaming animal
Our antagony
Who dare defy forever scream
Screaming of the unborn
Son of god you scream out loud, how blind we be, I follow bleeding
I will now promptly bring people, far from the oblivion, come evil!
Now danger reaches out to devour me
Freedom saw your god on the throne
Only the gods are said to leave the party
Those here will live on forever
Screaming of the unborn
Son of god you scream out loud, how blind we be, I follow bleeding
I will now promptly bring people, far from the oblivion, come evil!
I am purity, gasoline armada
?? The devil, my empire, ??
Never had the chance to be born
You might also likeScreaming of the unborn
Son of god you scream out loud, how blind we be, I follow bleeding
I will now promptly bring people, far from the oblivion, come evil!Embed
