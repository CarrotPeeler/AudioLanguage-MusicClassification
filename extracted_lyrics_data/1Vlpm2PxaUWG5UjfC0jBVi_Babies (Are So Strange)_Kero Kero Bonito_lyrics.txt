17 ContributorsBabies (Are So Strange) Lyrics
They can't even talk
And they keep us up
'Cause they always want to suck
Babies are so strange
I guess we must love them very much
To put up with all that stuff

分かってるんだよ自分が
女に産まれたって事が
本当は血なんか怖くないもん
毎月毎月見てるもん
だから何？私は魔女ってこと？
生理があるから絶対やだ
妊娠義務？絶対やだ
まだやりたい事いっぱいあるもん

They can't even talk
And they keep us up
'Cause they always want to suck
Babies are so strange
I guess we must love them very much
To put up with all that stuff

妊娠って簡単に言うけど
私にとっては怖すぎる
Just like the film Alien
お腹の中から飛び出るよ
まだ出来ないんだ
夢 give up
続けて行きたい
夢を keep up
そなにほしけりゃ自分で産めば？
Don't think so!

Everybody try to bite off your toes
And simultaneously touch your nose
I bet you look pretty stupid right now

They can't even talk
And they keep us up
'Cause they always want to suck
Babies are so strange
I guess we must love them very much
To put up with all that stuff

Child-producing machine
That's what nature has designed me to be
Child-producing machine
I guess we'll see1Embed
