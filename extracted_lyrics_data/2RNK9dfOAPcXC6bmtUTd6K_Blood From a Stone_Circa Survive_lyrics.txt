8 ContributorsBlood From a Stone Lyrics
Every moment I stand there and wait I recall
How you told me you don't care
It was there that you ruptured the seal in the wall
That time cannot repair
Letting it be what it is
It's impossible to know what you need
When you seem so emotionless

What'll bring you back to life?
Machine beware turn it back again

Just wanted to know every word that was said
So many were unclear
And I didn't notice if anything changed
Until you left me here
Setting it free with the wind
Seems impossible that we'd let it be what it is
So emotionless
 

Your stories never end
Our time is now suspended
I never feared man
So why won't you let me in this time?
You might also like
What'll bring you back to life?
What'll bring you back?
I want to bring you back
