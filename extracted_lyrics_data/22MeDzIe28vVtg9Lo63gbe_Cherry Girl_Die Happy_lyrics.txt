1 ContributorCherry Girl LyricsHer smile is bright like the universe
She makes everybody happy
The blue sky is inspired by her eyes
She's got a beautiful face and it's a beautiful day
When she walks around but she never comes by
She got someone who doesn't like to share
She knows her love is much stronger than fear
And the hope that she keeps, makes her courage disappear
She's a cherry girl, he calls her cherry girl
She knows, she means the world to his heart
Every time she wants to go away
He paints 1000 cherries in her face
He's so happy when she's there
Step back gotta get some air again
Dancing pirouettes in her kitchen
Pushed by two invisible hands too fast
Seems like she never stops, always turning around
Till she's dizzy and aching, she falls to the ground
The two hands become more visible each day
She knows her love is much stronger than fear
And the hope that she keeps, makes her courage disappear
She's a cherry girl, he calls her cherry girl
She knows, she means the world to his heart
Every time she wants to go away
He paints 1000 cherries in her face
He's so happy when she's there
He helps her up when she falls down
He says he's sorry for what he's done
He swears the biggest love on earth
He'll always be there for her
She's dancing faster everyday
She cannot go, she cannot stay
With all the cherries in her faceYou might also likeEmbed
