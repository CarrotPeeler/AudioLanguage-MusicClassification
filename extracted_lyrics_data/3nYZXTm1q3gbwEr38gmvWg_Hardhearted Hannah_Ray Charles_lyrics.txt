6 ContributorsHardhearted Hannah Lyrics
They call her hard-hearted Hannah
The vamp of Savannah
The meanest girl in town

Leather is tough
But Hannah's heart is tougher
She's a girl who likes to see men suffer
To tease them and thrill them
To torture and kill them, ooh
Is her delight they say
I saw her at the seashore with a great big pan
There was Hannah pouring water on a drowning man
That's hard-hearted Hannah
The vamp of Savannah, GA

They call her hard-hearted Hannah
The vamp of Savannah
The meanest girl in town

Talk about your cold refrigerating mommas
Brother she's a polar bears pajamas
To tease them and thrill them
To torture and kill them, ooh
Is her delight they say
An evening spent with Hannah sitting on your knees
Is like being in Alaska in your B.V.D.'s

That's hard-hearted Hannah
