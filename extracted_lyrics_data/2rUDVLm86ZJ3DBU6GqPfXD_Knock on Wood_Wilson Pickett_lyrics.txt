That I got, if I do I will surely, surely lose a lot
'Cause your lovin' better than any love I know
It's like thunder, lightning
The way you love me is frightening
I better knock, knock on wood, baby
I'm not superstitious about you, I can't take no chance
You got me spinnin', baby I'm in a trance
'Cause your lovin' better than any love I know
It's like thunder, lightning, the way you love me is frightening
I better knock, knock on wood, baby
It's no secret that woman feels my loving cup
Yeah, she sees to it that I get enough
Just one touch from her, you know it means so much
You're like thunder, lightning, the way you love me is frightening
I better knock, knock on wood, baby
I better knock, oh
Oh yeah, think I better knock, knock on wood
I better knock, knock on wood
Think I better knock, knock on woodYou might also likeEmbed
