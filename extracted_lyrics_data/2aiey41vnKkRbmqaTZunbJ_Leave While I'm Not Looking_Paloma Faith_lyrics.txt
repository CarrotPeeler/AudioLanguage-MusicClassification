6 ContributorsLeave While Iâ€™m Not Looking Lyrics
If you're gonna leave
You're gonna leave my heart in pieces
If you're gonna go
Then you're gonna be the reason why I, I, I cry
If this is goodbye
Then you're gonna leave me shattered
You're gonna take away
Only everything that matters
I, I, I might die

So if you go, leave while I'm not looking
Do it fast, oh, please, don't kill me slow
Leave while I'm not looking
Go silently so my heart won't know
Leave while I'm not looking
'Cause I can't watch you go, watch you go, watch you go

If this is the end then it's only gonna end me
You rip my heart apart
There ain't nothing gonna mend me
I, I, I won't lie
If you walk away then baby, I don't wanna see it
You're gonna take away only all I've ever needed
I-I-I might die
You might also like
So if you go, leave while I'm not looking
Do it fast, oh, please, don't kill me slow
Leave while I'm not looking
Go silently so my heart won't know
Leave while I'm not looking
'Cause I can't watch you go, watch you go, watch you go

(Please) Have some mercy
You hurt me more than you know

So if you go, leave while I'm not looking
Do it fast, oh, please, don't kill me slow
Leave while I'm not looking
Go silently so my heart won't know
Leave while I'm not looking
'Cause I, I can't stand to see you go
I, I can't stand to see you go
Watch you go, watch you go, oh no
Watch you go, watch you go
Can't stand to see you go1Embed
