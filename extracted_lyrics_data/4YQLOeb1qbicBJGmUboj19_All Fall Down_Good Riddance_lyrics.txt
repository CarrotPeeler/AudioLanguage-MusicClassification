2 ContributorsAll Fall Down LyricsGive me sensibilities without ambition
Give me accolades i've done nothing to collect
Then you spread your plague of ignorance across the planet earth
Robbing us of tons of self respect
It's a plan these are ways
To a person we all fall down
Unless we rise as one and resist the right right right right
It's a plan these are ways
To a person we all fall down
Unless we rise as one and resist the right!
When we cease to question war as entertainment
And christian battle hymns will keep us pacified
You can tie a yellow ribbon 'round your cock boy
You're just along for the ride
It's a plan these are ways
To a person we all fall down
Unless we rise as one and resist the right right right right
It's a plan these are ways
To a person we all fall down
Unless we rise as one and resist the right!

The harbingers of eden all fall down
The corporate rock religion all falls down
The liar in the office he falls down
It's a plan these are ways
To a person we all fall down
Unless we rise as one and resist the right right right right
It's a plan these are ways
To a person we all fall down
Unless we rise as one and resist the...
