2 ContributorsTo Catch a Killer Lyrics
My name is John and I dress as a clown, thirty one bodies I've buried underground
A construction worker I like building flats and pulling rabbits out of hats
But under my make-up I'm a mischievous man
Killing as many boys as I can

Do they who I am? I don't think they do
Then I'll send them a liver to give them a clue
I'll send them a letter and write it in blood and tell them about the things I've done

Brings them back, they drink beer, a deadly brew
Eating his boys has their flesh for his food
Gave them money to pose, put a drill in their head
Didn't want them to leave tried to get them into bed

My name's Ted Bundy and I kill for fun, nobody knows how many I've done
They tried to lock me up but I escaped from that place
And when they killed me I had a smile on my face

Killed my kids and the people that we had round to stay
Put them under the patio so they couldn't get away

John George Haigh, you can't catch me
One fatal error and guilty is my only plea
Thrity gallons of acid, down in the cellar
Thrity gallons of acid, false teeth of an unkown dweller
Come on Mrs D have a dance with me, it's going to be your last
Sulphuric acid a major key
Four more before, it's a perfect plan
Four more again
Kill as many as I canEmbed
