We are hiding on the far side of the moon
We are hiding on the far side of the moon

How far we go?
How far we go?
How far we go?
How far we go?
How far we go?

How far we go?
(We are hiding on the far side of the moon)
How far we go?
(We are hiding on the far side of the moon)
How far we go?
(We are hiding on the far side of the moon)
