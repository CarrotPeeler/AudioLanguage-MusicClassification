5 ContributorsEvery Weekday LyricsThe last thing I want is to be tiptoeing around you
I want you to know that I'm proud of you
In my head you're nineteen going on ninety nine
You are Saturday and Sunday, every weekday friend of mine
We got a little butter, we took a little bread
It's there for the taking, come put us to the test
We're going to make a record then sail around the world
We might not storm the charts completely but we'll do our very best
As long as I'm with you
I'll have a friend so true
There is nobody quite like me you say
There is no one half as good as you
I don't want to sound like I've written us off
But the words and the feelings are pouring and
I can't turn them off, no I can't turn them off
I won't let you down, take all of my time
But don't, no don't, no don't let me down
As long as I'm with you
Oh, I'll have a friend so true
There is nobody quite like me you say
And there is no one half as good as you
I don't want to sound like I've written us off
But the words and the feelings are pouring and
I can't turn them off, no I can't turn them off
I won't let you down, take all of my time
But don't, don't, no don't let me downYou might also likeEmbed
