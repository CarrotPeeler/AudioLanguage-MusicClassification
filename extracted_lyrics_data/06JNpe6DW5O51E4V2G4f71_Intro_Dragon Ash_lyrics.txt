1 ContributorDragon wakes up Lyrics/intro\
My dragon asleep
All gonna see
How dangerous he is
They think it's false memories
That dargon wakes up in his ruins
/Verse 1\
I keep him in my cave , there so much bones
I couldn't sleep , so need to go to the corner
I tired to hear his gnawin'
But he always growin'
I couldn't let him go
/Pre-chorus\
He broke his leash on neck
Set everything in the fire

/Chorus\
My dragon asleep
All gonna see
How dangerous he is
They think it's false memories
That dargon wakes up in his ruins
You might also like/Post-chorus\
He's wake up, wake up
Yea,yea he's wakе up
He's wake up, wake up
Yеa,yea he's wake up
He's wake up, wake up
Yea,yea he's wake up
/Verse 2\
Trust me, you are in safe
While you in this place
He is underground in my basement
He couldn't go away and set in fire our environment and land
/Pre-chorus\
Oh no
/Chorus\
My dragon asleep
All gonna see
How dangerous he is
They think it's false memories
That dargon wakes up in his ruins
My dragon asleep
All gonna see
How dangerous he is
They think it's false memories
That dargon wakes up in his ruins
/Post-chorus\
He's wake up, wake up
Yea,yea he's wake up
He's wake up, wake up
Yea,yea he's wake up
He's wake up, wake upEmbed
