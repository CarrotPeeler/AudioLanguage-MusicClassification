3 ContributorsPoison ivy LyricsShe comes on like a rose
And everybody knows
She'll get you in Dutch
You can look but you'd better not touch
Poison ivy, poison ivy
Well late at night when you're sleeping
Poison ivy comes a creeping all around
She's pretty as a daisy
But look out man she's crazy
She'll really do you in
But if you let her get under your skin
Poison ivy, poison ivy
Well late at night when you're sleeping
Poison ivy comes a creeping all around
Measles make you bumpy
And mumps will make you lumpy
And chicken pox will make you jump and twitch
A common cold will cool you
But whooping cough will fool you
But poison ivy's gonna make you itch
You're gonna need an ocean of Calamine lotion
You'll be scratching like a hound
The minute you start to mess around
Poison ivy, poison ivy
Well late at night when you're sleeping
Poison ivy comes a creeping all around
Measles make you bumpy
And mumps will make you lumpy
And chicken pox will make you jump and twitch
A common cold will cool you
And whooping cough will fool you
But poison ivy's gonna make you itch
You're gonna need an ocean of Calamine lotion
And you'll be scratching like a hound
The minute you start to mess around
Poison ivy, poison ivy
Well late at night when you're sleeping
Poison ivy comes a creeping all around
