1 ContributorBleed As One LyricsI uncover my eyes to watch you drown
To see the truth in your despair 
Reveal the love that holds you down
And leaves you gasping for air
Gasping for air 
Don't close your eyes now, see me
I hold your heart now, feel me
We'll bleed as one now, forever
As we're meant to be
Don't close your eyes now, see me
I hold your heart now, feel me
We'll bleed as one now, forever
As we're meant to be 
The ocean swallows us 
A dark sea of fleeting sorrow 
Our blood runs black into rust 
We will live to see tomorrow 
Don't close your eyes now, see me
I hold your heart now, feel me
We'll bleed as one now, forever
As we're meant to be
Don't close your eyes now, see me
I hold your heart now, feel me
We'll bleed as one now, forever
As we're meant to be

We can see that love is blind
Look into my bloodshot eyes
We can see that love is blind
We'll bleed as one
We'll bleed as one
We'll bleed as one
Forever
As we're meant to be
Don't close your eyes now, see me
I hold your heart now, feel me
We'll bleed as one now, forever
As we're meant to be
Don't close your eyes now, see me
I hold your heart now, feel me
We'll bleed as one now, forever
As we're meant to be 
As we bleed
As we bleed as one
As we bleed as oneEmbed
