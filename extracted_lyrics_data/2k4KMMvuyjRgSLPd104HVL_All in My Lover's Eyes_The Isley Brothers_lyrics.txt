6 ContributorsAll In My Loverâ€™s Eyes Lyrics
I just wanna see
The best side of me
And it's so easy to be
'Cause it's all
'Cause it's all in my lover's eyes
I just wanna know
The best way to go
And it's goin' to show
'Cause it's all
'Cause it's all in my lover's eyes

Love shinin' bright
By day and by night
Ooh, by candlelight
Well, it's all
Well, it's all in my lover's eyes
(Lover's eyes)

And love's gonna flow
Come and go
Ooh, you know I know
That it's all
That it's all in my lover's eyes
You might also like
I just wanna, I wanna, I wanna see
I wanna see the best side of me
And it's so easy to be
I know it's all
All in my lover's eyes
Oh, it's all in my lover's eyes
I know it is
Ooh, ah, yeah, baby
I wanna say it in a whisper
(Lover's eyes)

Ooh, ooh
I love you, love you, baby
And I'll always, always, always, always need you, girlEmbed
