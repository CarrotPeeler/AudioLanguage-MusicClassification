20 ContributorsYou & Me Lyrics
Got a light in your eyes, I can see it
Look into my mind to believe it
Try hard to remember the beach
Blue water from the sea, hands all over me
Tattoos, they were glistening
It's been so long since someone made me different

Give heaven a try, be young and be wild
Be free and alive
Give heaven a try, be young and be wild
Just feel alive
It’s just you and the sun, it’s just you and the sun now baby

Gonna light up the skies, I can see it
You're God’s favorite child, boy, believe it
Try hard to remember the days
Sick as fucking cyanide
Diamonds and getting blazed
Your tattoos, still magnificent
No longer high, but you're not very different

Give heaven a try, be young and be wild
Be free and alive
Give heaven a try, be young and be wild
Just feel alive
It’s just you and the sun, it’s just you and the sun now baby

I get so damn tired
You set my soul on fire
Ignite me, inspired
Make me higher and higher

Give heaven a try, be young and be wild
Be free and alive
Give heaven a try, be young and be wild
Just feel alive
It’s just you and the sun, it’s just you and the sun now baby2Embed
