2 ContributorsThere She Was LyricsHeads turn around
And it's just like her engine, is movin' on sound
Radio's playin' her favourite song
She's silently humming along
Sunset Boulevard
Just for a moment you think you're a star
Suddenly, out of the blue
You feel like she's lookin' at you
And this boy surely knows what to do
There she was cruisin' down on Main Street
One hand on the wheel, wavin' me goodbye
All the boys in town would have died for a ride
But they don't know she'll be mine
The night in L.A
But I don't feel the need to go away
The car in the driveway, they know
But the keys are inside and I hear
That she whispers sweet words in my ear
There she was cruisin' down on Main Street
One hand on the wheel, wavin' me goodbye
All the boys in town would have died for a ride
But they don't know she is mine

Yeah
There she was cruisin' down on Main Street
One hand on the wheel, wavin' me goodbye
All the boys in town would have died for a ride
But they don't know she is mine
There she was cruisin' down on Main Street
One hand on the wheel, wavin' me goodbye
All the boys in town would have died for a ride
But they don't know
Here we are cruisin' down on Main StreetEmbed
