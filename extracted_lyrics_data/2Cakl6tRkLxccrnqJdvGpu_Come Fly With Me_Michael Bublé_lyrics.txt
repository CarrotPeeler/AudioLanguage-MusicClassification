Come fly with me, let's fly, let's fly away
If you can use some exotic booze
There's a bar in far Bombay
Come fly with me, let's fly, let's fly away
Come fly with me, let's float down to Peru
In lama land, there's a one man band
And he'll toot his flute for you
Come fly with me, let's take off in the blue

Once I get you up there
Where the air is rarefied
We'll just glide
Starry-eyed
Once I get you up there
I'll be holding you so near
You may hear the angels cheer
Because we're together

Weather-wise, it's such a lovely day
Just say the words, and we'll beat those birds
Down to Acapulco Bay
It's perfect for a flying honeymoon, they say
So come fly with me, let's fly, let's fly away

Once I get you up there
Where the air is rarefied
We'll just glide
Starry-eyed
Once I get you up there
I'll be holding you so near
You may hear all the angels cheer
Because we're together

Weather-wise, it's such a lovely day
You just say the words, and we'll beat those birds
Down to Acapulco Bay
It's so perfect for a flyin' honeymoon, they say
Come fly with me, let's fly, let's fly
Pack up, let's fly awayEmbed
