7 ContributorsHoneysuckle Rose Lyrics
Every honey bee
Fills with jealousy
When they see you out with me
I don't blame them
Goodness knows
Honeysuckle rose
When we're passin' by
Flowers droop and sigh
And I know the reason why
You're much sweeter
Goodness knows
Honeysuckle rose
Don't buy sugar
You just have to touch my cup
You're my sugar
It's sweet when you stir it up
When I'm taking sips
From your tasty lips
The honey fairly drips
You're confection, goodness knows
Honeysuckle rose
You might also like
Oh when I'm takin' sips
From the tasty lips
The honey fairly drips
Confection goodness knows
Talkin' 'bout honeysuckle rose
Yes, yesEmbed
