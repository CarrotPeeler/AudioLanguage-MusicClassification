Huh
Huh

You don't need to hang around
You don't need to talk right now
(Ooh-ooh-ooh)
Got a feelin', the same mistake
Got a feelin' it's gonna break

Some days, sometimes, just don't feel right
Ah-ah (Ah), ooh-ah

Too hot to touch, it's getting too much
You know it's just a state of mind
Driving you wild, you're torn up inside
You know it's just a state of mind

Huh
(State of mind) Huh

All I need is to breathe
All I need is to believe
(Ooh-ooh-ooh) Ah
Gonna happen, now I know
Gonna happen, take it slow
You might also like
Some days, sometimes, it just goes right
Ah-ah (Ah), ooh-ah

Too hot to touch (To touch), it's getting too much (Too much)
You know it's just a state of mind
Driving you wild (You wild), you're torn up inside (Inside)
You know it's just a state of mind

(State of mind)
(State of mind)

(Ah) Too hot to touch
(Yeah, wow)
(Ah-ah, woo-ah) It's my state of mind
Driving you wild (I was driving you wild)
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha

Too hot to touch, it's getting too much
You know it's just a state of mind
Driving you wild, you're torn up inside
You know it's just a state of mind
(State of mind)
(State of mind)

Too hot to touch (To touch), it's getting too much (Too much)
You know it's just a state of mind
Driving you wild, you're torn up inside (Inside)
You know it's just a state of mind

(State of mind)
(State of mind)

You know it's just a state of mind1Embed
