3 ContributorsStarscream Forever LyricsIf you could see to the centre of the universe
You can find some peace of mind
Leave your life behind
Wake up in the morning light
You're surrounded by fire
All the darkness deep inside
Followed by desire
Madness falling from the sky
Endless tide waves rolling high
And we pray together
Stars will scream forever
If you could see to the centre of the universe
You can find some peace of mind
Leave your life behind
Wake up in the morning light
You're surrounded by fire
All the darkness deep inside
Followed by desire
Madness falling from the sky
Endless tide waves rolling high
And we pray together
Stars will scream forever
