7 ContributorsRock-A-Hula Baby Lyrics
Rock-a-hula, rock, rock-a-hula
Rock-a-hula, rock, rock-a-hula
Rock-a-hula, rock, rock-a-hula
Rock-a-hula, rock, rock-a-hula
Rock-a-hula, rock, rock-a-hula
Rock-a-hula, rah
Rock-a-hula, rock
A-hula rock, a-hula rock, a-hula rock (Pow!)

The way she moves her hips up to her fingertips
I feel I'm heaven bound
And when she starts to sway, I've gotta say
She really moves the grass around

Rock-a-hula baby
Rock-a-hula baby
Got a hula lu from Honolu’
That rock-a-hula baby of mine

Although I love to kiss my little hula miss
I never get the chance
I wanna hold her tight all through the night
But all she wants to do is dance
You might also like
Rock-a-hula baby
Rock-a-hula baby
Got a hula lu from Honolu’
That rock-a-hula baby of mine
Rock-a-hula baby
Rock-a-hula baby
Rock-a-hula baby
Rock, rock, rock, rock
Rock-a-hula baby
Rock-a-hula baby
Rock-a-hula baby
Rock, rock, rock, rock

Rock-a-hula baby
Rock-a-hula baby
Got a hula lu from Honolu’
That rock-a-hula baby of mine
Oh well, that rock-a-hula baby of mineEmbed
