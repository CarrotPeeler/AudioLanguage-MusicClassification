7 ContributorsFeel This Lyrics
Busted heart, my brain is beat, yeah
Don’t want a doctor
Need zero anesthetic to make me numb
Escape is easy and everybody’s offering

I wanna feel this, gotta have to bear witness
Gonna take pain straight the way I found it
I gotta feel this so I can kick this sickness
The only way to get my mind around it

Busted brain, my heart is beat, yeah
Don’t want a bottle
Or well-intended smiles and lies
Escape is easy and everybody’s offering

I wanna feel this, gotta have to bear witness
Gonna take pain straight the way I found it
I gotta feel this so I can kick this sickness
Wanna take pain straight the way I found it

Can’t get around it
Can’t heal without itYou might also like2Embed
