6 ContributorsEvil Eyes LyricsThe where I've been and the things I've seen
Well I just try remembering
That in their dreams those kings and queens
Are feeling just the way I feel
Aji maji la taraji
Aji maji la taraji
Aji maji la taraji
Aji maji la taraji
My wish come true
I'm moving up to pastures new
To see it all again anew
It's always and forever true
That this is all I have to do
To get to you
Aji maji la taraji
Aji maji la taraji
Aji maji la taraji
Aji maji la taraji
My spell on you
Hocus
Hocus pocus
Out of the realm of a dark material
Opus
New modus
Can't describe adequately
This ethereal dream
You might also likeMaking love's only make believe
It's possible to be achieved
If you're brave enough to take the lead
Invention always follows need
I have come to claim my prize
To kiss you on your tired eyes
My hopes and dreams all realized
The moment I've made up my mind
Focus
If I just focus
If I superstitiously believe
This wish will come true
(I wish for you)
Evil eye
I'll keep you by my side
This evil eye
Has powers I require
Your strange magic may
Keep me from harm's way
I've witnessed, eye
Its mystery at play
Gonna put those demons in their place
(Get to know them)
Gonna slap myself across the face
(Above and below 'em)
Gotta face my demons or be damned
(Fear and loathing)
The devil's work is made by idle hands
(Comin' and goin')
Gonna put those demons in their place
(Get to know them)
Gonna slap myself across the face
(Above and below 'em)
Gotta face my demons all the day
(Fear and loathing)
The devil's work is made by idle hands
(Comin' and goin')
Gonna put those demons in their place
Hocus
Hocus pocus
Cast a spell and hope to hell
The Gods are listening
Ipsis
Calling oris
Out of the heavens we fell
With the formula
Come true
Aji maji la taraji
Aji maji la taraji
Aji maji la taraji
Aji maji la taraji
My wish come true4Embed
