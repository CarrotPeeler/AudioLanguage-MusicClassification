1 ContributorMetanoia LyricsBassinets, clarinets
Proletarian chariots
Polyunsaturated cinemaplexi
Glass cathedrals
Anxious daffodils
Falling off the window sill
But better still a sleeping pill
L-tryptophan's illegal
Squirming, unlearning
Swirling in a cloud of unknowing
Silence, violence
Swirling in a cloud of unknowing
Hellacool swimming pools
Corporate tools, vestibules
Herring bones, monotones
Macrocosmic snowcones
Stroking the ego
Wrapping it up in swaddling clothes
Anointing it with aluminum foil
Squirming, unlearning
Twirling in a clowd of unknowing
Silence, violence
Twirling in a clowd of unknowing
You might also likeAluminum siding salesmen
Drowning in a sea of alliteration
Relentlessly searching for
Non-existent clarity
Big fat bluffin'
Anguished muffin
Bad Brain H.R. Puffinstuffin
Dirty socks
Onobox
Goldilocks and cream cheese
Drunken boat, billy goat
Trapped in Annette Funicello
Full of fish and roses and the posies
Squirming, unlearning
Pudding in a cloud of unknowing
Silence, violence
Pudding in a cloud of unknowing
Quantum plumbing, the pineal gland
The sixth chakra, the seventh seal
Enveloping pelicans pecking at the crumbs
Of enlightenment
Retrograde planets plunging into the arms of AmericaEmbed
