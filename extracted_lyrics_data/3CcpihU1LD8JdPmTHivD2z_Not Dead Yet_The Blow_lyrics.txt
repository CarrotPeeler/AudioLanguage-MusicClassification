2 ContributorsNot Dead Yet LyricsBet you love is a ship, oh
In the air
It stays afloat 'cause we both care
A circulating faith that makes us hover like we do
Keep choosing me, I'll keep choosing you
You know that you could kill our love and so could I
But it's not dead yet
It's not dead yet
It's not dead yet
It's not dead yet
Bet you love is a ship, oh
In the air
It stays afloat as long as we both care
A thrust of hope that keeps us both suspended in belief
We don't touch down
That's what we've agreed
You know that you could kill our love and so could I
But it's not dead yet
It's not dead yet
It's not dead yet
It's not dead yet
You say "just what would it take for us to ever really make it die?"
One day we may stand aside as our love falls out of the sky
But it's not dead yet
It's not dead yet
It's not dead yet
It's not dead yetYou might also likeEmbed
