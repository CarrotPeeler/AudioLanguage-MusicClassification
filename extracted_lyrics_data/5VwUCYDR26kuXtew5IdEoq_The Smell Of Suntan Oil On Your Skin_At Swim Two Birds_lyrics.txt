1 ContributorThe Smell Of Suntan Oil On Your Skin LyricsThe smell of suntan oil on your skin
You whisper "I don't care the way we begin this"
As long as it ends before it starts
As long as the tears don't dwell in my eyes
Thin red lips start to fade
Fist unclenched and eyes glaze over
Skirt high around your waist
The air is sick with your taste
My heart needs red blood, your heart stands still
You don't flinch as my cigarette pushes into your forehead
Your future ends as my begins
Your day dissolves as my horizons widen
Before the credits start to roll
Before the criminal hour is up in the last scene
Before the girl gets her boy
I'll leave by the same way that I came in
The same way I came inYou might also likeEmbed
