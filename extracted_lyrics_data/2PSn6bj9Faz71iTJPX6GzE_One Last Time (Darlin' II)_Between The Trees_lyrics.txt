1 ContributorOne Last Time (Darlinâ€™ II) LyricsAll that I know is you change something in me
I envy the power you have
My hearts stirring so just kiss me
One last time before you go
If I let you leave promise you'll return to me darling
Keep my distance you say while holding my hand
I love it when you're this close to me
Because you speak so intently as you say come kiss me
One last time before you go
If I let you leave promise you'll return to me
One last time before you go
If I let you leave promise you'll return to me, yeah darling
One last time before you go
If I let you leave promise you'll return to me
One last time before you go
If I let you leave promise you'll return to me darlingYou might also likeEmbed
