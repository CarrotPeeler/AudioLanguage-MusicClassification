I'm dreaming of sleeping next to you
I'm feeling like a lost little boy in a brand new town
I'm counting my sheep and each one that passes is another dream to ashes
And they all fall down
And as I lay me down tonight
I close my eyes
What a beautiful sight

I'm sleeping to dream about you
I'm so damn tired
Of having to live without you
But I, I don't mind
I'm sleeping to dream about you
I'm so tired
Oh, yes I am

I found myself in the riches
Your eyes, your lips, your hair, you were everywhere out there
But I woke up in the ditches, I hit the light and I thought you might be here
But you were nowhere
Oh love, you were nowhere at home
And as I lay me back to sleep
This love I pray that I can't keep
You might also like
I'm sleeping to dream about you
I'm so damn tired
Of having to live without you
But I, I don't mind
I'm sleeping to dream about you
I'm so tired

This is just a little a lullaby to keep myself from crying
Myself a little lullaby to keep, keep
My eyes from always crying, this is just a little lullaby
I'm trying to get myself to fall asleep, sleep
It's just a little lullaby
So I don't cry myself to sleep at night

Sleeping to dream about you
I'm so damn tired
Of having to live without you
But I, I don't mind
I'm sleeping to dream about you
I'm so tired
I'm so tired
I'm so tired2Embed
