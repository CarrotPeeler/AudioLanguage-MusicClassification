4 ContributorsSetian Massacre Lyrics
Yeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaw! (Woooooooooooow!)

Screaming in agony, cries fill the air
Eyes once full of hope, shedding tears of despair
All that they've ever known is dead
Yeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaw! (Woooooooooooow!)

Fire reigns from above, iron birds of dread
All that they've ever loved is dead
All that they've ever dreamt is dead

Yet there's a glint of hope
If the chosen can survive
In secret the ten thousand hide
East in the mountains
The chosen bide their time
The Clouding, our strike on mankind


Yeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaw! (Woooooooooooow!)
Temples are burning
Streets soaked with blood
Heed the prophecy, destiny is done
All that they've ever loved is dead
All that they've ever dreamt is dead
You might also like
Yet there's a glint of hope
If the chosen can survive
In secret the ten thousand hide
East in the mountains
The chosen bide their time
The Clouding, our strike on mankind
Yet there's a glint of hope
If the chosen can survive
In secret the ten thousand hide
East in the mountains
The chosen bide their time
The Clouding, our strike on mankind
