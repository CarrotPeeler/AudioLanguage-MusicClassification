What's that you say?
What do you think you know?
Let's talk about it
Just what you think
You hear me say?
I said I'm gonna watch it grow
Let's react to it
Let's talk about it
Let's react to it
Let's talk about it
Let's react to it
Let's talk about it
It's a tale I relay (wa-oh)
Do we have the right time of day? (wa-oh)
Such attack, hooray (that's so)
I told ya anything left to play (wa-oh)
What's that you see?
What's that you say?
What do you think you know?
Let's talk about it
Just what you think
You hear me say?
I said I'm gonna watch it grow
Let's react to it
Let's talk about it
Let's react to it
Let's talk about it
Let's react to it
Let's talk about it
Let's react to itYou might also likeEmbed
