1 ContributorPrimavera Now LyricsLook up to the sky
And feel the sun come shining down on me
And the music
And the music
And the music
Come on to the back seat
Wanna make you feel that chill go down your spine
Like lovers feel
Like lovers feel
Like lovers feel
Yo no quiero ser tu boyfriend
So gimme some sugar and skip the talking
'cause I know you're feeling kinky freaky hot
Primavera now boys and girls in bloom
And the city is hot and the feeling's good
Like choco panda breakdowns in the summer
And the drums spit the beat
And the boys wanna freak
Fuck around make some love
For the thrill of it, for the thrill of it
Look up to the sky
And feel the sun come shining down on me
And the music
And the music
And the music
You might also likeCome on to the back seat
Wanna make you feel that chilI go down your spine
Like lovers feel
Like lovers feel
Like lovers feel
Yo no quiero ser tu boyfriend
So gimme some sugar and skip the talking
'cause I know you're feeling kinky freaky hot
Primavera now boys and girls in bloom
And the city is hot and the feeling's good
Like choco panda breakdowns in the summer
Like in the summer, like in the summer
Like waiting for the summer
And the drums spit the beat
And the boys wanna freak
Fuck around make some love
For the thrill of it, for the thrill of it
