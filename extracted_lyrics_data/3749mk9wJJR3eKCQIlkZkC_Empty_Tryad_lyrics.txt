1 ContributorEmpty LyricsDo what you will
Share some sympathy
All that you do with me
Is lost in eternity
Grab all you want
You'll never hold on to me
Everything you see is
Totally empty
Nothing we feel
Is lasting or real
Everything fades
Womb to the grave
Take what you can
Yet in the end
It's all no better
Smoke in thin air
Come what may
All I can say
Is savour this day
Then we'll pass away
If everyone knew
Their years are few
What would they do
Faced with this truth
You might also likeAh...
So here we all are
Working so hard
Climbing so high
Do we know why
One thing is clear
Everyone here
Is in the same boat
Sink or float
Live and learn
Suddenly turns
To one more step
Die and forget
Ah...
Do what you will
Share some sympathy
All that you do with me
Is lost in eternity
Grab all you want
You'll never hold on to me
Everything you see is
Totally empty
Nothing we feel
Is lasting or real
Everything fades
Womb to the grave
Ah...Embed
