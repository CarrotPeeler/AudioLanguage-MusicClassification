3 ContributorsTell Me Lyrics
I want you back again
I want your love again
I know you find it hard to reason with me
But this time it's different, darlin', you'll see
You'll see
You'll see

You gotta tell me you're comin' back to me
You gotta tell me you're comin' back to me
You gotta tell me you're comin' back to me
You gotta tell me you're comin' back to me

You said "we're through" before
You walked out on me before
I hear the knock on my door, but then it never comes
And I hear the telephone, but that hasn't rung
N't rung
N't rung

You gotta tell me you're comin' back to me
You gotta tell me you're comin' back to me
You gotta tell me you're comin' back to me
You gotta tell me you're comin' back to me
You might also like

You gotta tell me you're comin' back to me
You gotta tell me you're comin' back to me
You gotta tell me you're comin' back to me
You gotta tell me you're comin' back to me
You gotta tell me you're comin' back to me
You gotta tell me you're comin' back to me
You gotta tell me you're comin' back to me
You gotta tell me you're comin' back to me

(You gotta come)
You gotta tell me you're comin' back to me
(Back where you belong)
You gotta tell me you're comin' back to me
(Back to the good boy)
You gotta tell me you're comin' back to me
(Come back where you belong)
You gotta tell me you're comin' back to me
(You gotta come)
You gotta tell me you're comin' back to me
(Back where you belong)
You gotta tell me you're comin' back to me
(This could come and go)
You gotta tell me you're comin' back to me
(I need you at home)
You gotta tell me, tell meEmbed
