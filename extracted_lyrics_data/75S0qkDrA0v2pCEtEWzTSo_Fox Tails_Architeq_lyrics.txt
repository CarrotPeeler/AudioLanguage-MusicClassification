1 ContributorDenialspelledwrong. LyricsThere is no place for what needs to be said
There is nothing real here at all
I have no time for you or any of the shit i do
Im forcing everything
I start fights they want to finish
We are voiceless in our homes
Foxtails in my throat choke me to death
I will never be who i wish that i was
I want to be the mother i thought i had
But I am birthless in my bones
Ive got no hope
I am not beautiful
You are capable of failure
We cannot deny ourselves forevеr
Abuse your power
While my paranoia fuеls me
The open veins we conceal have infected our architecture
Theres nothing we can do
We can't hide anymoreYou might also likeEmbed
