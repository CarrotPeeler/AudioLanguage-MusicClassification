1 ContributorHideaway LyricsYou know the time you fell
And I helped as best as I could
But now it's all on top of our heads
You know I couldn't just leave it there
But we tried and he saw
You know the time we stood
And I showed you where I first felt
That the weather and the birds conspire
You know they take these things quite hard
But we tried and he saw
But you know if you sing that song
Then the wolves will come
And they'll scratch right down our door
Until you scream for the day to come
It's a heartfelt apology from him to me
That say, "You lost, and it's all on top of our heads"
We'll go to the river mouth
Where it sings so softly to me
And runs right through our veins
And we learned each other's names
But we tried and he sawYou might also likeEmbed
