2 ContributorsWorth It All LyricsIt's worth it all
If I can just see You, feel You
It's worth it all
If there's just one that sees you, feels You
I know it will be worth it all
All the time it's taken
To be here in this place
The scars have left their mark
But I'm still running
Forgetting what is behind
I'm moving straight ahead
And I will run with a passion till I reach the end
I won't let my eyes move left to right
I'll run with all my heart, I'll give it all I got
It's worth it all
If I can just see You, feel You
It's worth it all
If there's just one that sees you, feels You
Remembering all those voice
Arrows that cut me down
There's something burning in me
That keeps me running
You might also likeForgetting what is behind
I'm moving straight ahead
And I will run with a passion till I reach the end
I won't let my eyes move left to right
I'll run with all my heart, I'll give it all I got
It's worth it all
If I can just see You, feel You
It's worth it all
If there's just one that sees you, feels You
I know it will be worth it all
I know it will be worth it all
I know it will be worth it all
I know it will be worth it all
I won't let my eyes move left to right
I'll run with all my heart, I'll give it all I got
It's worth it all
If I can just see You, feel You
It's worth it all
If there's just one that sees you, feels You
I know it will be worth it all
(Forgetting what is behind
I'm moving straight ahead
And I will run with a passion till I reach the end
I won't let my eyes move left to right
I'll run with all my heart, I'll give it all I got)
I know it will be worth it allEmbed
