Won't be first to fall asleep
And all your secrets I will keep
Braid my hair I’ll paint your nails
We'll tell each other ghostly tales
Who's your crush I’ll tell you mine
You like him? I guess he's alright
Did you see Amanda's skort?
OH MY GOSH SHE'S SUCH A DORK

Slumber party at my house tonight
Slumber party we'll have a fucking pillow fight
Slumber party till the morning light
Slumber party, we'll have a real good time

Watching movies in the dark
Oh my gosh did you just fart?
Hey let's prank call Chad and Luke
Stacey says he think's you’re cute
Popcorn movies make up hair
What do you choose truth or dare?
Uhhhh DARE

Slumber party at my house tonight
Slumber party we’ll have a fucking pillow fight
Slumber party till the morning light
Slumber party, we'll have a real good time
You might also like
Now she’s fast asleep
Get a cup of water to heat
Does anybody got a sharpie
Amanda's totally gonna freak

Slumber party at my house tonight
Slumber party we'll have a fucking pillow fight
Slumber party 'til the morning light
Slumber party, we’ll have a real good timeEmbed
