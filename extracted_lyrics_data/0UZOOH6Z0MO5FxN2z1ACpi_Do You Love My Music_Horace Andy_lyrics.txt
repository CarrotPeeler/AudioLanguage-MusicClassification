7 ContributorsWalk Em Lyrics
Ooh, Tash (Drench)
You niggas know what the fuck goin' on?
Grrah
Stoop, go stupid
Ayy, AR
I do not—
I do not— (Soldado)
Uh, I do not rap, but I really get busy

Ain't it funny how niggas forget (How to forget)
Shit I did, niggas make me regret
I don't tolerate, no disrespect
Pay your homage, I come to collect
Used to lack dollars, but never no knowledge
I used what I knew and I made it correct
Not really into the mess
Nowadays, every little thing 'bout a check
Niggas do everything for the love and the clout
And the money, it's sad what it's coming to
And I might be your fave and you bummy, but this rapper ain't no one to run into
Bullets fast nigga, where is your runnin' to?
Stop drillin', I swear I be wantin' to
Stop hurtin', I swear I be wantin' to
I ain't playin', I swear I be wantin' you
It's really me against me and it feel like I'm losin' this battle, still
And I'm comin' in late
'Cause I'm way too deep in that battlefield (Grrah)
You can hear all the pain in my music
Finally found me a way, I could use it
Do you love me? Or you tryin' to use me?
Swear the devil be tryin' confuse me
You might also like
Pull up and drench, we don't do no talkin'
Might tell Vito to walk 'em
You already know G Beans gon' chalk 'em or I'll tell Bdot hawk 'em
King Drench still sendin' 'em shots
Got more money than all of my opps
(I ain't gon' lie, this shit gas)
Breezy and Boomer, we smoke 'em alot

Bitch, you know I ain't stressin' you
Only attachment I got is extendable
If they tryna kill me, why is they sendin' you? (You pussy)
You should get switches, they recommendable
Never run out of ammo, bullets is plentiful
She wanna get next to me, I'm not accessible
But if I do, I won't be the one that's gon' rescue you
Them niggas gon' pull up they're skeptical 'cause them niggas know I won't be the one, that's gon' wrestle you
Them hollows gon' hit you and whoever next to you
He was brolic, but they made him flexible
Too much switches, they ain't preventable
Get your wife, she all on my genitals

Pull up and drench, we don't do no talkin'
Might tell Vito to walk 'em
You already know G Beans gon' chalk 'em or I'll tell Bdot hawk 'em
King Drench still sendin' 'em shots
Got more money than all of my opps
(I ain't gon' lie, this shit gas)
Breezy and Boomer, we smoke 'em alotEmbed
