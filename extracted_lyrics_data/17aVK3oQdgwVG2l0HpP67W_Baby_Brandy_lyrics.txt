Ah, yeah

Baby, baby, baby, baby
Don't you know that you're so fine?
Hey, yeah, hey, yeah
Baby, baby, baby, baby (Baby, baby)
Think about you all the time
Hey, yeah, hey, yeah

Guess it's time to say, baby, baby
How you make me feel when you come to mind
I can't keep my cool, baby, baby
I can't hold it inside
I can't wait each day just to see you walk
Trying to move in close to get to where you are
Not trying to be rude, baby, baby
Nothin' ventured, nothin' gained, so I'm tellin' you

Baby, baby, baby, baby (Ah, yeah)
Don't you know that you're so fine?
Hey, yeah, hey, yeah (Woah)
Baby, baby, baby, baby (Ooh yeah, oh yeah, yeah)
Think about you all the time
Hey, yeah, hey, yeah
You might also like
Words just ain't enough, baby, baby
But that's all I can use to state my intentions
Hope it gets to love, baby, baby, yeah
It's a perfect situation
'Cause we fit together like a hand in glove
Just to be with you is all I'm thinkin' of, woah, yeah
What else can I say, baby? Ooh, baby
We are alone, and I'm singin' this song to you, baby

Baby, baby, baby, baby (Ooh, yeah)
Don't you know that you're so fine? (You're so fine, you're so fine)
Hey, yeah, hey, yeah (You're so fine, yeah)
Baby, baby, baby, baby (Oh, yeah)
Think about you all the time (Ooh)
Hey, yeah, hey, yeah (Woah, yeah)
Baby, baby, baby, baby (Baby, baby)
Don't you know that you're so fine? (Baby, you're so fine)
Hey, yeah, hey, yeah (You're so fine, so fine, so fine, yeah)
Baby, baby, baby, baby
Think about you all the time (Woah)
Hey, yeah, hey, yeah (You know, baby)

My darling (My darling)
Oh, baby (Oh, my baby)
You're all I'm thinkin' of (You're all I'm thinkin' of)
Baby
