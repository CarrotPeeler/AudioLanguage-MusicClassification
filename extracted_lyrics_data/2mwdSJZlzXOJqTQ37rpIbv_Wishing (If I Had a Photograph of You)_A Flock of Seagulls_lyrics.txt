15 ContributorsWishing (If I Had a Photograph of You) Lyrics
It's not the way you look, it's not the way that you smile
Although there's something to them
It's not the way you have your hair, it's not that certain style
It could be that perfume

If I had a photograph of you
Or something to remind me
I wouldn't spend my life just wishing

It's not the makeup, and it's not the way that you dance
And it's not the evening sky
It's more the way your eyes are laughing as they glance
Across the great divide

If I had a photograph of you
Or something to remind me
I wouldn't spend my life just wishing

If it's not the things you say, it's not the things you do
There must be something more
And if I feel this way for so long, tell me is it all for nothing
You'll still walk out the door

If I had a photograph of you
Or something to remind me
I wouldn't spend my life just wishingEmbed
