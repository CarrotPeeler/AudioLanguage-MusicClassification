2 ContributorsBig BW LyricsWhat are we gonna do
While we're waiting here?
Caught in a traffic jam, goin' nowhere
See the rain
Has made a space for us to place our minds
Inside that sound of winter
I hear it on my window pane
Callin' out my name
Telling me to stay
Gotta know what you're runnin' from
Before you know where you runnin' to
What you'd leave behind
I'll be gone when the mornin' comes
The sun's gonna paint a view
Colours in your life
Gotta know what you're runnin' from
Before you know where you runnin' to
What you'd leave behind
I'll be gone when the mornin' comes
The sun's gonna paint a view
Colours in your life
In the wake of your goodbye
I linger
I linger
Clingin' to what might have been
Might have been, have been

The truth comes when we fold
Lets yourself start over again
Lay down, lay down
In the wake of your goodbye
I linger
Lay down, your head
Preaching with my heart and soul
You got, no place
Well the sun shines through the cold
And the truth comes when we fold
Got to know
Don't let yourself
Got to know
Dont' forget yourself
Got to know
Got to know
Gotta know what you're runnin' from
Before you know where you runnin' to
What you'd leave behind
I'll be gone when the mornin' comes
The sun's gonna paint a view
Colours in your life
Gotta know what you're runnin' from
Before you know where you runnin' to
What you'd leave behind
I'll be gone when the mornin' comes
The sun's gonna paint a view
Colours in your lifeEmbed
