Down here on the ground
Since it all began
Experiment in moral and behavior
In spite of all imperfection
I'm a fan of man
The worm is my rose too

Many my name
But one and the same
Chaos, being
And the everlasting flame

Phosphoros
Lucifer
Stand up!
In praise of the morning star!
Phosphoros
Lucifer
Say it!
Chief rebel angel!
Phosphoros
Lucifer
Stand up!
In praise of the morning star!
You might also like
Don't get too cocky
Keep yourself small
Don't ever let them see you coming
Look at me
Underestimated from day one
You never see me coming
I'm a surprise

Solid my game
We're one and the same
The chaos, the being
And the everlasting flame!

Phosphoros
Lucifer
Stand up!
In praise of the morning star!
Phosphoros
Lucifer
Say it!
Chief rebel angel!
Phosphoros
Lucifer
Stand up!
In praise of the morning star!
Watching, waiting
Holding my breath
But I'm no puppeteer
The stage is set
You pull your own strings now
Like butterfly wings
Once they're touched
They never leave the ground
No, I don't make things happen here!

Phosphoros
Lucifer
Stand up!
In praise of the morning star!
Phosphoros
Lucifer
Say it!
Chief rebel angel!
Phosphoros
Lucifer
Stand up!
In praise of the morning star!
Phosphoros
Lucifer
Say my name!
Phosphoros
Lucifer
Say my name!
Phosphoros
Lucifer
Say my name!Embed
