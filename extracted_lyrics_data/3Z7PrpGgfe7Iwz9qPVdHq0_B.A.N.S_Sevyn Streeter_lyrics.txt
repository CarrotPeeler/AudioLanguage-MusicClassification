24 ContributorsB.A.N.S. Lyrics
I should've I never offered it
But he made me feel like this could be forever
Never thought he gon' run off with it
But that don't make it no better
He used to hit me least 4 times a day
'Til he got what he wanted
Caught me by surprise
I never saw it coming

Walls fell down and up
There goes my pride
Guards shattered
Now I realized…

I should've used protection
Instead of moving so fast
But I'm a sucker for affection
Shoulda never showed you that
And now I got myself to blame why did I let you come in
I shouldn't gave my heart away but I trusted you with it

Niggas be on that bullshit
Having us looking foolish
Can't keep lettin' 'em do this
Bitch ass niggas
One minute call us baby
Next minute call us crazy
Niggas be on that bullshit
Bitch ass niggas
You might also like
And you’ll say it's all in my head
It's all in my head
It's all in my head
So ignore my intuition and
Believe every word that you said

Walls fell down and up
There goes my pride
Guards shattered
Now I realized…

I should've used protection
Instead of moving so fast
But I'm a sucker for affection
Shoulda never showed you that
And now I got myself to blame why did I let you come in
I shouldn't gave my heart away but I trusted you with it

Niggas be on that bullshit
Having us looking foolish
Can't keep lettin' 'em do this
Bitch ass niggas
One minute call us baby
Next minute call us crazy
Niggas be on that bullshit
Bitch ass niggas
Niggas be on that bullshit
Acting like they don't do shit
Do shit, do shit
What the fuck? I look stupid?
But this is the way that you made me
And this is the way you repay me?
Gave you all of me, all of me
Now you saying I was never your lady
I feel
Like you was just a waste of time for real
Yeah, that's that true shit
Oh, and I won't ever confuse it, no
Not ever again

I should've used protection
Instead of moving so fast
But I'm a sucker for affection
Shoulda never showed you that
And now I got myself to blame why did I let you come in
I shouldn't gave my heart away but I trusted you with it

Niggas be on that bullshit
Having us looking foolish
Can't keep lettin' 'em do this
Bitch ass niggas
One minute call us baby
Next minute call us crazy
Niggas be on that bullshit
Bitch ass niggas
Bitch ass niggas
All these bitch ass niggas
That true shit
Niggas be on that bullshit24Embed
