10 ContributorsThe Parable Lyrics
Repress all you know
My apologies, Eno
But it's all in your head
Fiction based off truths you may need to aid you, guide you

You are the language
Ever-flowing
Ever-echoing
You are, you are, you are, you are
On the eve of knowing all
My dear Eno
Patience 'cause this all subsides
In due time, all will be clear

And the truth is
I couldn't love you more than I have come to know
And this Mother Sun is proud to have watched you grow
Grow

You are the perceiver that perceived the parable
The never ending end
You are the infinite (Intuit)
You are the finite (Fire)
You are, you are, you are, you are
You might also like
You are the perceiver that perceived the parable
The never ending end
You are the infinite (Intuit)
You are the finite (Fire)
You are, you are, you are, you are

You are the perceiver that perceived the parable
The never ending end
You are the infinite (Intuit)
You are the finite (Fire)
You are, you are, you are, you are

"In other words, that the so called involuntary circulation of your blood is one continuous process with the stars shining. If you find out that it’s you who circulates your blood you will at the same moment find out that you are shining the sun. Because your physical organism is one continuous process with everything else that is going on. Just as the waves are continuous with the ocean, your body is continuous with the total energy system of the cosmos—and it's all you. Only you’re playing the game that you’re only this bit of it."1Embed
