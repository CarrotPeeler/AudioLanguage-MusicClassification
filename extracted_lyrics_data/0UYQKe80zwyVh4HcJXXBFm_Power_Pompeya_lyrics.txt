Who wanna take the power
Who wants to stand in front
Who's got the will to break down
Spin the fire in his arms
Do you wanna be here to see him
Do you want to stand beside
There is nothing you can give him
But the power in your eyes

Who wanna take the power
Who will catch the hour
While you dance with the fireworks
Cheering his name

Do you wanna be here to hear him
Or don't wanna be here in fear of him
At least you always need him
Although he's not a saint
Who wanna be a leader
Who wants to stand up straight
Whose heart has not withered
Whose soul has not faded
You might also like
Here is the great exiter
Coming out from the mist
Spin wider and wider
"We dont we don't have to resist"

Saviour sun
Won't you come along to be my friend?
(come along to be my friend)
(come along to be my friend)
Saviour sun
Won't you shine on me and take my hand?
(shine on me and take my hand)
(shine on me and take my hand)3Embed
