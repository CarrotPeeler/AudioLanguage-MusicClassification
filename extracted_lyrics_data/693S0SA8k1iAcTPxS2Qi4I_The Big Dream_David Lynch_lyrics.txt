In the wind
The wind blows through
The trees and stars
We make a wish
To be
Together
This night
When we dream
Together
We'll remember
When we dream
Together
The big dream
The time has come
To say the words
We want to hear
The time has come
To say the words
We want to hear
Love is the name
In the wind
The wind blows through
The trees and stars
We make a wish
To be
Together
This night
When we dream
Together
We'll remember
When we dream
Together
It's the big dream
The big dream
The big dream
It's the big dream
The big dream
The big dream
