20 ContributorsLove Generation Lyrics
We should be love, you know
You know, some people just get fooled
Some people get schooled
Some people get outlawed, you know
But in front of the Almighty God, we're all the same
We're all God's children
And we are the parents, so we must be the fathers
And mothers of the children that's growin' up
So we have a brand new love generation
Love generation, come on

(Bum-bam, ba-ba-bum, bam, ba-ba-bum, bam
Ba-ba-bum, ba-bam
Ba-ba-bum, bam, ba-ba-bum, bam, ba-ba-bum, bam
Ba-ba-bum, ba-bam
Ba-ba-bum, bam, ba-ba-bum, bam, ba-ba-bum, bam
Ba-ba-bum, ba-bam)

From Jamaica to the world
It's just love, it's just love, Eh!

Why must the children play in the streets
Broken hearts and faded dreams
Peace on Earth to everyone that you meet
Don't you worry, it could be so sweet
Just look to the rainbow, you will see
The Sun will shine 'til eternity
I've got so much love in my heart
No one can tear it apart, yeah

This love, that we're always searching for more
Yet still, we don't wanna give up our selfish thoughts
Too much kids in the streets, Lord knows they made so sweet
Gotta give hope, gotta give peace
Got to seek, this love that's so, so meek
This love, this love so meek
Gotta give the children, a future
Some kind of hope
Can't leave them out in the cold
Fighting for riches, getting re-owed
I wanna see a sunshine
Wanna see what's on, your mind
We gotta give hope, gotta believe
We gotta receive the love
We got to give them, we got to give them
We got to give them that love, yeah
We got to give them, we got to give them
Gotta live them that love
You know what I'm talkin' 'bout!

Don't get hooked up on what you see
(Be the love generation)
'Cause the greatest thing is spirituality
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, give it up
(Be the love generation)
C'mon, give it up
(C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon – eh!)
