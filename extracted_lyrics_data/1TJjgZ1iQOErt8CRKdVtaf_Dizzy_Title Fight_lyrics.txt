11 ContributorsDizzy LyricsShirt was in the car
When it happened
Swear to god we're cursed
With all this sadness
I'm dizzy in the thought
Memory loss
Your chrysalis
Nighttime wanderer
Venom drip
King of somber
Fumble on a road
Blackened backyard
Weapon from a trunk
Static Recall
I'm dizzy in the thought
Memory loss
Your chrysalis
Nighttime wanderer
Venom drip
King of somber
Slow like my fist
Underwater
Blended light
