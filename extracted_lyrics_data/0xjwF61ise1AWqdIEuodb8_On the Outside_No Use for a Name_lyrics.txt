6 ContributorsOn the Outside Lyrics
It's funny been inside, isn't it?
'Cause when you are inside
You're still actually outside
Aren't you?
Then you can say when you're outside
You're inside because you're always inside your head

I'll see you on the outside
And we'll never be the same
After all that's happened
What is it that we've gained?
I've made mistakes before
And never lived them down
After all you've done for me, I'm bound
(Don't say another word)
To see you on the outside where we can both be sane
(You're speaking for yourself)
I'm bleeding on the inside a place you might have been but now I know I'll never be the same

Well, I heard you got a new place and it's far away from here
Reality has sunken in now confirming all my fears
Not gonna track you down but it's too late to stop
Thinking 'bout the time that we have lost
(I'm happy without you)
I'm tryin' to forget you, and everything we had
(We didn't stand a chance)
We're miserable and it's true
We haven't learned a thing
But now I know I'll trust no one else
You might also like
(There's a time when we were back and forth, it wasn't easy)
I guess we're back where we belong
One thing is for sure, it wasn't strong

I'll see you on the outside
Where we can both feel same
(You've never been more right)
I'm dying on the inside, you're never coming back
And now I know whatever we go through
My heart is stuck with you

(My heart is stuck with you)3Embed
