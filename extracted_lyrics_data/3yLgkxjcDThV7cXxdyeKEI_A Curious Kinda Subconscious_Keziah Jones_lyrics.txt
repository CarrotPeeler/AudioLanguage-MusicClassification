1 ContributorA Curious Kinda Subconscious LyricsWe're naked
I hope everybody can see our skins
We're naked
Can you see the mind, the soul
The body we're in ?
Chorus 1
There's a curious kind of subconscious
Runnin free runnin free
Inside of me
With a curious speed
It intervenes
In color
We're waiting
For time to pass by and tell the truth
We're waiting
For the lies to filter down to the youth
Chorus 2
Can't they see
Every time they discover
The key to life is not in their hands
I believe what they fear in color
Ain't nothin but a curious kind of
Subconscious
I'm laughing
When I see the first world
Crying for the third
They're dying
And not even first world tears
Can fade your color
Not even first world tears
Chorus 1
Chorus 2
Not even first world tears
Can fade your color !You might also likeEmbed
