5 ContributorsWalk On By Lyrics
If you see me walking down the street
And I start to cry each time we meet

Walk on by, walk on by
Just make believe
That you don't see the tears
Just let me grieve
In private because each time I see you
I break down and cry
Walk on by
(Don't stop)
And walk on by
(Don't stop)
And walk on by

I just can't get over losing you
And so if I seem broken and blue

Walk on by, walk on by
'Cause foolish pride
Is all that I have left
So let me hide
The tears and the sadness you gave me
When you said goodbye
Walk on by
(Don't stop)
Walk on by
(Don't stop)
Walk on by
(Don't stop)
You might also like

Walk on by, walk on by
This foolish pride
Is all that I have left
So let me hide
The tears and the sadness you gave me
When you said goodbye
Walk on by
(Don't stop)
Walk on by
(Don't stop)

Now you know you gotta go so walk on by
(Don't, no, don't, don't stop)
Make believe you never see the tears I cry
(Don't, no, don't, don't stop)
Now you know you gotta go so walk on by
(Don't, no, don't, don't stop)
Make believe you never see the tears I cry
(Don't, no, don't, don't stop)Embed
