5 ContributorsCome Friendly Bombs LyricsBlack knuckles and broken teeth
Grey days and grey streets
Same faces that same release
If this town had a name it would be defeat
So sick of waking up to white skies
Can't stand the look in everybody's eyes
They want to kick my fucking head in just to feel alive
Do you wanna go?
I wanna go
Do you wanna go?
Let's go
Black knuckles and broken teeth
I've got more bruises than the butcher's got beef
Do you wanna go?
I wanna go
Do you wanna go?
Let's go
We're not the same ones
We're not the same ones you and me
You and me we're not the same
We're not the same ones
We're not the same ones you and me
No you and me we're not the same
You might also like(If) we were the same ones
I'd draw this knife across my throat and bleed it dry
If we were the same ones
I'd draw this knife across my throat and bleed it dry
Black knuckles and broken teeth
I know your face that from alley last week
About eleven I was walking home
Down a fucking alley I was on my own
So sick of trouble from these hearts
Can't take my breathing in the fucking dark
Too bad this mongrel's got a bite worse than his bark
Do you wanna go?
I wanna go
Do you wanna go?
Let's go
Black knuckles and broken teeth
I've got more bruises that butchers beef
Do you wanna go?
I wanna go
I wanna go
Let's go
We're not the same ones
We're not the same ones you and me
No you and me we're not the same
We're not the same ones
We're not the same ones you and me
No you and me we're not the same
(If) we were the same ones
I'd draw this knife across my throat and bleed it dry
If we were the same ones
I'd draw this knife across my throat and bleed it dry
We're not the same ones
We're not the same
We're not the same ones
We're not the same
You and me, You and meEmbed
