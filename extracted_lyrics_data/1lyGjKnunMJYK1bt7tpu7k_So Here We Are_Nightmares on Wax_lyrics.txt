51 ContributorsIâ€™m the Purple Guy (Remastered) Lyrics
Hello, hello
Uh, this is just a friendly reminder about our company policy regarding the safe room, at no point should a customer go inside
Management has also been made aware that the spring-body animatronic has been noticeably moved

So here we are, my body inside this nightmare
Don't you stare for too long at my curse
What happened too fast, what happened in the past
Is something I would constantly rehearse
Yeah, I'm aggressive, nightmare unleashed
Feast your eyes on my magnetic demise beneath
All the tattered wires
Your futile demise will become your curse

So I trapped myself away from immortal dismay
Then the blood so profound came to send me down
All the cable in my brain making me go insane
But the soul still lives

I am the purple guy, come to see the show tonight
Turn the spotlight onto me, my body's ready, now begin
Now the purple rise, come to conquer all your cries
The phantoms are the less of your worries, so you better hurry
Just crank the noise
I'm the purple guy, you now die!
You might also like
It's been too long, the blood shed on the walls inside of me
What was I to do when they could see
There's only one suit, what else was I to shoot?
Yet now I'm stuck for all eternity
So now I suffer, turmoil and fear is all around
You see the phantoms are yet to be freed
But they're stuck inside the immortal fire that burned them all
'Til the end was surely near

So I trapped myself away from immortal dismay
Then the blood so profound came to send me down
All the cable in my brain making me go insane
But the soul still lives

I am the purple guy, come to see the show tonight
Turn the spotlight onto me, my body's ready, now begin
Now the purple rise, come to conquer all your cries
The phantoms are the less of your worries, so you better hurry
Just crank the noise
I'm the purple guy, you now die!

Leave me alone, I'm caught to the bone
The Springtrap has risen, goddamn, he's not alone
Leave me alone, I'm caught to the bone
The Springtrap has risen, goddamn, he's not alone
Leave me alone, I'm caught to the bone
The Springtrap has risen, goddamn, he's not alone
Leave me alone, I'm caught to the bone!
The Springtrap has risen, goddamn, he's not alone!
I am the purple guy, come to see the show tonight
Turn the spotlight onto me, my body's ready, now begin
Now the purple rise, come to conquer all your cries
The phantoms are the less of your worries, so you better hurry
Just crank the noise
I'm the purple guy!

Leave me alone, I'm caught to the bone!
The Springtrap has risen, goddamn, he's not alone!Embed
