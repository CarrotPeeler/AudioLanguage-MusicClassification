2 ContributorsDeathbox LyricsI'm in a state of despair
Nothing seems to fit my mind
And although I can't be there
I still know that there's a place
For someone just like me
Now, will I ever wake up?
Wake up to see the box I'm in
And will I ever stand up
I'm standing on the edge of inability
And though I'm trying
It still penetrates my body
All these demons that
I carry deep inside
(Deep inside)
The changing faces
Forces me to leave the traces
Of the stranger things
That are growing in my mind
I know that I have
Done this once or twice before
The names are still a blur
I'm arrogantly close to
Falling off the edge
You might also likeI know I'm not insane
Though my head hurts on the inside
The images disturb me
I know I'm not insane
I'm not what they call me
They are no good
Still surrounding me
Forcing my actions upon me
The blood just paints my world
They are no good
Still surrounding me
Forcing my actions upon me
They're forcing my
Actions upon my deathbox
And though I'm trying
It still penetrates my body
All these demons that
I carry deep inside
(Deep inside)
The changing faces
Forces me to leave the traces
Of the stranger things
That are growing in my mind
Now, will I ever wake up?
Wake up to see the box I'm in
And will I ever stand up
I'm standing on the edge of inability
Now, is this a failure
My project kill is right awake
I'm all burned out from pressure
My thoughts have brought me
To my knees, awake in pain
They are no good
Still surrounding me
Forcing my actions upon me
The blood just paints my world
They are no good
Still surrounding me
Forcing my actions upon me
They're forcing my
Actions upon my deathboxEmbed
