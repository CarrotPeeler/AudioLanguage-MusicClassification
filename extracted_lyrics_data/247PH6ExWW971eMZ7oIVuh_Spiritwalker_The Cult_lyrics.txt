Let it be beautiful when I sing the last song
I will give you even my body, Spiritwalker
Let all the children kiss the sun before they sing their last song
I will give you even my body, Spiritwalker

Let the sun shine on me when I sing the last song
I will give you even my body, Spiritwalker
Let all the children kiss the stars before they sing their last song
I will give you even my body, Spiritwalker

Spiritwalker

Spiritwalker

Let all the children kiss the sun before they sing their last song
Let all the children kiss the sun before they sing their last song
I will have the whole world to make music with me
