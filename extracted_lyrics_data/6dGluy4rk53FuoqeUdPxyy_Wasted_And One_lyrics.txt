1 ContributorWasted Lyrics
Get out of my way, 'cause you know
That I am totally wasted

She wants a change in her human life
As she puts herself under the cutting knife
She wants the look and feel of an angel
Mm, even if it means a deal with the devil
Even if it means a deal with the devil

Get out of my way, 'cause you know
That I am totally wasted
Get out, get out
'Cause I'm everything you ever hated
Get out of my way, 'cause you know
That I am totally wasted
Get out, get out
'Cause I'm everything for you

I hear screams of a thousand virgins
Mm, I see the dreams of mighty surgeons
I see the dreams of mighty surgeons
You might also like
Get out of my way, 'cause you know
That I am totally wasted
Get out, get out
'Cause I'm everything you ever hated
Get out of my way, 'cause you know
That I am totally wasted
Get out, get out
'Cause I'm everything for you

So, when I get my sleep underground
Take notice of a distant sound:
Sleepless soul, wretched and torn
Just waiting to be reborn

Get out of my way, 'cause you know
That I am totally wasted
Get out, get out
'Cause I'm everything you ever hated
Get out of my way, 'cause you know
That I am totally wasted
Get out, get out
'Cause I'm everything
Get out, get out
'Cause I'm everything
Get out, get out
'Cause I'm everything for you
'Cause you know that I am totally wasted
'Cause I'm everything you ever hated
Get out of my way
'Cause you know that I am totally wasted
'Cause I'm everything you ever hated
Get out of my way
'Cause you know that I am totally wastedEmbed
