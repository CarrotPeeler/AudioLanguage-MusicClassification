We'll yell, life sure is swell! In Sin City
In the heat where the servants of silence dwell
The visions of the wicked are sure to sell! In Sin City
On the quickest strip goin', cum holy high rollin' with me
Get you cash cup flowin', cum holy high rollin' with me
In the street where the Savior of Sodom dwells
Join hands with the women who squirm in hell, In Sin City
Because the Lord has mercy on the women that sell
Their pussies to the preachers who burn in hell, In Sin City
On the quickest strip goin', cum holy high rollin' with me
Get you cash cup flowin', cum holy high rollin' with me
Let your holy mother blow your fears away
Get on your knees and play!
The Devil's home for the depraved
Where the souls are never saved
That's why the holy rollers say
Get on you knees and pray
You might also likeTo breathe in Sin City
To lie in Sin City
Get high in Sin City
Let your holy water wash away your shame
Cause the judgment day is just another game
On your knees and pray!Embed
