2 ContributorsConfessor LyricsYou give me the madness
I'll give you a sign
No need to be mindless
At the scene of the crime
Now do you have a confession
That you want to make?
Your resurrection
I'm ready to take
Release the fantasy
And catch the final trip
Unleash the majesty
And tighten up your grip
Inside your memory
Has choked on broken glass
Beneath the Karma tree
You know this too shall pass
I won't let you walk this path alone
Confessor
Let the motor burn
Confessor
Its time to overturn
Confessor
Can't justify the past
I see your colors
Were born to last
You might also likeIt's your resolution
What cannot be done
A simple solution
Before it all begun
And if you happen to see me
I'm already there
Out here on the hillside
I'm everywhere
Release the fantasy
And catch the final trip
Unleash the majesty
And tighten up your grip
Inside your memory
Has choked on broken glass
Beneath the Karma tree
You know this too shall pass
I won't let you walk this path alone
Confessor
Let the motor burn
Confessor
Its time to overturn
Confessor
Can't justify the past
I see your colors
Were born to last
Release the fantasy
And catch the final trip
Unleash the majesty
And tighten up your grip
Inside your memory
Has choked on broken glass
Beneath the Karma tree
You know this too shall pass
I won't let you walk this path aloneEmbed
