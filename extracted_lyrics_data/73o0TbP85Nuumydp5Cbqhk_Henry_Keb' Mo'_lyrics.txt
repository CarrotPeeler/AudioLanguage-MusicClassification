When cotton was picked by hand
Down in Dixy under southern sky
Working from sun to sun
Remember if you will
Lightening from a whiskey still
The blues and the breese
The sweet magnolia trees
A little church house upon the hill
Chourus
And I can hear the Delta calling
From the light of a distant star
I can see my future and i can feel my past
When Henry plays his steel guitar
Ohhh oh yea
Won't you take be back in time
And free me from this crime
Well I have no shame and I have no blame
Its time for us to be moving on
Chours

From the light of a distant star
I can see my future and I can feel my past
When Henry plays his steel guitar
When Henry plays his steel guitar
And I can hear the delta calling
From the light of a distant star
I can see my future and I can feel my past
When Henry plays his steel guitar
When Henry plays his steel guitarEmbed
