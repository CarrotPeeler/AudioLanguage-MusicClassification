1 ContributorThe Rise Of Triopticon LyricsTriopticon, what are you to become?
Caught now inside, the new reason to exist
Triopticon, what will it soon become?
Now she is tied to this path
Growing up and getting strong, born and let loose...
And when the firm now rises
She feels that her fears fly
This will be me, this one urge to live on
So it moves on, lust like never before
Growing up and getting strong, born and let loose...
And when the firm now rises
She feels that her fears fly
Multinational: much more than dream
Now the world is watching the company
Built up from scratch, still more fights left to fight
Some aims are gone; some just now in her tangled mind
The fire burning bright, carries on this endless fuse
And as the yearning grows, so does the firm now rise
With nothing more to lose, not at least for her
And watching it all come true, she hopes not ever to dieYou might also likeEmbed
