I feel like Metro Boomin'
Cause I want Some More
Spanish bitch, ruby choker
All around her throat
I swear I jump into the
Crowd at all my shows
And I swear my bitch jump
In the bed, Geronimo
And my babymama ask me if
I see these hoes
I swear these legs get to rappin'
Like they Shawty Lo
If a lady wanna talk
Direct em to my bro
He dat way, yeah dat way
Ooh, ooh

Put the rocks up in my Sake
If she want me, then she gonna cop me
But I'll never take her shoppin'
Asian bitch eatin' pocky
She hip to me jus like she hop-y
In her spare time like a hobby
Take it fast, no Ricky Bobby
Shawty gon' gimme toppy
10, 4, to the copy
We gon' turn it up in the nightclub
Then, we bring it to lobby
Ladies actin' so naughty
She off the bean, she so sloppy
Ya lady say I'm so hot-y
Shoot her down like an opp-y

I like the glitz and the glamour
Young nigga feelin' like a star
Red carpet Gala
I copped a Hollywood blonde
Stunt double, no actor
Foreign car, drive faster
Rolling Stone, Mick Jagger
I'm a beautiful disaster
I like to step in Valentino
All of my bitches illegal
I need a girl who throw down in the kitchen
Dark-skinned and speak Creole
Now I'm rollin' off the x, man
Shonen feelin' like an X-men
Young Surf, that's my homie
Good Intent, that's my best friend
I need more of the fast life
Hi-tek, yeah, that Act right
Scottish wench from the U.K
She gon' blow me like some bag pipes
I like strutting in Versace
Avionne wrist rocky
I need more excitement
Need a rush to feel my heartbeat
Lil shawty in the carseat
She want more of the long dick
Mix the molly with the Dramamine
Now, she swear she carsick
Lamborghini, yeah, the car sick
Living my life like a sinner
We just moving like the A-lists
We just moving like the winners
I like clothes
I like hoes
I like dough
I need more, aye
I need more, I need more
I need more, aye
I need more, I need more

Pussy bald like Amber Rose
Fuck that bitch, then I gotta go
"You the best," yeah, I suppose
Imma hit em on the nose
