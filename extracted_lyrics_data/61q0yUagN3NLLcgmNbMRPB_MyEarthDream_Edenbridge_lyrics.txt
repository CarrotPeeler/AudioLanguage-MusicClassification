We harbour an illusion
Estranged, all got out of hand
There's method in our madness
We crave for greenfield land
Plaintive cries
Our demise
Evil hour
No dim glow, just pain
We're leaving behind a stain
We're casting stones in the glass house of our promised land
Neverland (Never, Neverland)
Haunting beauty, second to none
Creator of life, under the sun
My Earth dream, oasis of light
Road ahead, powers unite
My Earth dream, oasis of prime
Karma cleansed, turn on a dime
What if the twain shall meet again
As in days of old?
Blind alley, an aimless walk
We bite the hands that feed us
But who cares when money talks?
You might also likePlaintive cries
Our demise
Evil hour
When time is of the essence here
We learnt to live in abject fear
We take it for granted and claim the moral high ground
And compound
Haunting beauty, second to none
Creator of life, under the sun
My Earth dream, oasis of light
Road ahead, powers unite
My Earth dream, oasis of prime (Oasis of prime)
Karma cleansed, turn on a dime
Our world restored to former glory
Writing a new story
Before the sands of time running out for us
The green lung bleeds, this path misleads
We came and smiled, grinded the faces of the wild
What goes around will come around
We reap the bitter harvest here
And we threw all caution to the winds
Covering a multitude of sins
Further afield, is our fate sealed?
Agent of change
Where are you? Come to rearrange
Return to grace, a newborn place
It is never too late to mend
Fools rush in where angels dare to tread
Truth will out, see to where our hopeless way has led
Can you tell me why
We didn't hear the call?
The bigger we are
The harder we fall
Smoke and mirrors rule
An irony of fate
We fight at every turn
Destroy what we create
Plaintive cries
Our demise
Evil hour
Human, hopelessly
A long way to learn
Some little crumbs of sense
Full steam astern
An enlightened age
Should create a force
To put the world to rights
Let nature take its course
My Earth dream, oasis of light
Road ahead, powers unite
My Earth dream, oasis of prime (Oasis of prime)
Karma cleansed, turn on a dime
The last card to play
My Earth dream, a world in shine
Back to the grand design
It is five to noon
And I still wish for the moon
Our restless pace has slowed
We have come to the end of the road
At the crossroads where we are
Hello, this is our last card
Let the slumbers never end
Believe for a moment in time (Moment in time)
No more grey and dreary deeds
Just a sliver of light
My Earth dreamEmbed
