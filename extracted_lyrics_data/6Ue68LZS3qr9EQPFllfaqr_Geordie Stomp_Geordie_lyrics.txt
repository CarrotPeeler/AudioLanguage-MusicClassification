1 ContributorGeordie Stomp LyricsLet me introduce to you
A brand new dance I got for you
Stomp on, stomp on, stomp on
Stomp on, stomp on
Alright! That's nice!
Stomp your boot heels on the floor
Do the Geordie Stomp some more
Stomp on, stomp on, stomp on
Stomp on, stomp on
Alright! So nice!
Stomp! Stomp! Stomp! Stomp!
Stomp! Stomp! Stomp! Stomp!
Next your hands go in the air
Shake 'em, snake 'em anywhere
Stomp on, stomp on, stomp on
Stomp on, stomp on
Alright! That's nice!
When the night comes to the end
You will find a brand new friend
Stomp on, stomp on, stomp on
Stomp on, stomp on
Alright! That's nice!
