2 ContributorsMe And My Woman LyricsMe and my woman
We don't get along
But one day at a time
Me and my woman
We don't get along
But one day at a time
One day we're fussing and fighting
And the next day we're doing fine
Monday-we're lovey dovey
Tuesday-we don't even sleep
Wednesday-she fixed me a steak now
Thursday night I don't even eat
Talking bout me and that woman
We don't get along
But one day at a time
One day we're fussing and fighting now
And the next day we're doing fine
(Guitar Solo) Oh, mmmm
Friday-everything is beautiful
Saturday- we have no peace
Sunday we go to church
And Sunday night-that woman called the police
Talking bout me and that woman
We don't get along
But one day at a time
One day we're fussing now
And the next day we're doing fine
Woah..........yes fine
(Guitar Solo)
