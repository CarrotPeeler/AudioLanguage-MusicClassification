It's a bad man's world
It's a bad man's world
It's a bad man's world
It's a bad man's world
It's a bad man's world
It's a bad man's world

Was I born as a promise to keep the peace
Or meet the shame
Before you split, one thing left
To give me my ordinary name
Give me my ordinary name

Now that I'm still standing
I've got something left to prove
Got a bullet left, but I can't decide
Which scorpion I'm gonna shoot
Will it be me, will it be you?

It's a bad man's world
It's a bad man's world
It's a bad man's world
It's a bad man's world
I'm a bad, bad girl
It's a bad man's world
You might also like
I will never forgive you
For what you put us kids through
Remember that night
You tried to take your own life?
When I found you
You were a shade of blue
And success is a state of mind
With a little bit of follow through
And then you failed at that too

It's a bad man's world
It's a bad man's world
It's a bad man's world
It's a bad man's world
I'm a bad, bad girl
It's a bad man's world

Will it be me, will it be you?

It's a bad man's world
It's a bad man's world
It's a bad man's world
It's a bad man's world
I'm a bad, bad girl
It's a bad man's worldEmbed
