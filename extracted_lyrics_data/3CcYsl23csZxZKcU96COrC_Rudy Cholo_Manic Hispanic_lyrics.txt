1 ContributorRudy Cholo LyricsEchoes of the Oldies
Comin' thru my barrio walls
They're throwin' him a goodbye party
But he's sittin' there all alone
Someone's humping in my bedroom
And his cousin's a-freakin' out
They think that no one respects them
And they're ready to throw down

Destination: Unknown, Rudy, Rudy, Rudy Cholo
Destination: Unknown, Rudy, Rudy, Rudy Cholo
He's leavin'
He's runnin' away from the man
They tried to bust him for a drive-by
So he's leavin' while he can
He can't make it in the Pinta
He'll go crazy locked up inside
So he kisses her on the cheek
And heads off into the night

Destination: Unknown, Rudy, Rudy, Rudy Cholo
Destination: Unknown, Rudy, Rudy, Rudy Cholo

She realizes Rudy is gone
She cries herself to sleep
And wonders if he'll ever come home
Someday he might send for her
And she'll follow him wherever he goes
She dreams of his chorizo
Dreaming all alone...

Destination: Unknown, Rudy, Rudy, Rudy Cholo
Rudy, Rudy, Rudy, Rudy CholoEmbed
