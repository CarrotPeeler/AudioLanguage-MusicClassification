1 ContributorWestwood Crib Session - (Freestyle) Lyrics
Do up the night
If I'm up I might
I let my power combine
I need my chakra aligned
J Smooth on my grind
The cookies that was nice
I was fried
(hmmm)
I step on a payment and inspire your life
Turn up your life
I need the game , this is chess
Dj  play me on the decks
(Dj, woo,woo)
Figure 8 to my left
Now im feeling itchy on my neck
IM a very big deal
If you dont fuck then chill
Promise me never again
Straight to the mil
Life on edge for the feel
You wasn't using your head
Nah
TEa and my biscuits
You don't want to miss this
Peak at my limit
Yah boy can't fight he a midget
Food on the digits
Ahh
Turn into digits
I roll a fat one, you rolling a midget
You might also like
Work hard thats daily
See chat couldn't pay me
They watch me , couldn't phase me
I do me, can't chagne me
Chase money i dont change me
I could never do basic (come on)
Everywhere i go i slay shit
Take time have patience
If tyou want it gotta wait
Pockets fat gaining weight
Some love hate
Self-made, self-paid
Me and my niggas we move for greatness
You could bnever ever tame this
No guap no dough
Funny how things change
Fines creaming out my name
Dis season for the gang you real done the ?
Independent, no label
You wonder how we still stable
Wonder how we still able
For the love and for the music, ahh
We don''t do it for the fame
H-O on the name
H-O know the name
H-O on the chain
H-O the name
H-O on the chain
H-O on the chain
Yo, ay
Ridding though  bricky , sipping on heenny
I feel like the man in my city
I keep on putting in the work and you know im tryna feel like Diddy
That'sno Biggie
Biopic
The schedule is busy, Im looking like Lizzie
We got the power liek 50,50,50
Sometimes i wish on a star
Hoping that its taking us far
Im in the gym moving weight
They can never complain
They try me, but i  never break
Look at the steak on my plate
You should owe me, i feel great
Playing cards, ace of spades
You know I'm making gains

Its minimal, its not much
Flex ain't much, its not nice
Rayan Neff, got no rocks, i don't want no ice
Betty wanna know the cost, wanna know the price
How could you cross that line ?
I'm part of the deal, im the deal
Real as real could be
Chill as an arctic seal
Clarks for the summer, Clarks for the winter
In the brownish-beige
My words are suede, tryna find out your name
Bad b wanna roll weed up
Her face turn blue like Peter
She don't really know about Sativa
I'm a young boy tryna get P's up
Can't hope on the wave,  no way
Better get your own, its finders keepers
I whole 'nother level I'm on with the bros
Its cold, like a bunch of freezers
Bad B wanna roll weed
Her face turn blue like Peter
She don't really know about Sativa
I'm a young boy tryna get P's up
Can't hope on the wave,  no way
Better get your own, its finders keepers
I whole 'nother level I'm on with the bros
Its cold, like a bunch of freezers
Boujee bad bitch
Big rasta spliff
Hanging from my lip
Its way too loud, might lick off your quiff
For my niggas in the back and they're rolling
True flex and the show got folded
And thats curtains
Got a Porley ting from Hattens
She give blows, so she got patterned
And i just seen the sweetest Latin in endz
Said i loked cute , I told her im flattered
Plus i just stepped in the booth
Slapped on a beat
Then it got shattered
And my guys there way to Juggy
I got a bag on me , A Boogie
Got snakes on my jumper now
Thats a gucci ting might slap on my hoodie

Love my wrist all buss down
She wants cause im up now
Poppin bottles in the club now
Whats the fussing whats the rush now?
Make it happen at the right time
Fucking bitches in my Guccis
From the 6 to the 6
Then she had to make a dip
Different flavours take a pc
Too cold, need mink
Do this for...
I ride and die for my niggas
Yeah, thinking the G and they wid it
If i wat it then i get it
Niggas lying they ain't wid it
We the team, stay winning

Spontaneous or  planned, i do it nice
Imma rum lanes, with one bang
We don't want no ice
Fake friends want guestlist, I have to say its tight
Still party that night
Spin that back, spin that back for me
We're gonna have to do that
It's House of Pharaohs  wth Tim Westwood
As I said large up the guy
Large up everyone here
New things
I know you go that feeling
Hahhha, yess
Spontaneous or  planned, i do it nice
Imma rum lanes, with one bang
We don't want no ice
Fake friends want guestlist, I have to say its tight
Still party that night
We ain't in this for the same reasons
No
Clock the game, with some dirty dealings
Yeess, Irish moss for the rasta man
Den turned into Superman
God bless us everywhere we go
Cookie pack like Snata's elves
Forget to bring it evrywhere we go
H-O , H-O

Ayy
Smoking flavors in the studio
Then right after I might go  and shoot a video
We ant ore than just a milli tho
Pull up, park in Krispy Kremes, Im doing donuts hoe
Loving the fashion, down to the fabric
They could not imagine, fire like magic
They coulda, vanished, find her like phantom
And we want the hunnids, like double the bands
They say we playing no games
She fuck for the fame, I gove her no clout
She have my name in her mouth
And real shit will make her bounce, bounce

Yo
H-O
H-O , H-O

Stop the assumptions
Smokin' some dumb shit
Smell like your armpit
Quiff off your headtop
Scratch me a big bud
And put Vultch in a headlock
Step out the door fresh air, I feel the breeze
Streets too hot, burn your jeans, 100 degrees
Could you believe, they hate weed
Oh man Please, I could not run leave off clean
I am not Scooby or Shaggy
Me and my crew very prestige
You and your jeans are tacky
Ayy

We set a bar (set that high)
You cannot par (No you can't )
I felt that bitch (I did)
Like oolalalala (oolala)
She wanna roll up and dine at the 3 starts
Im hitting the Shard (hitting the Shard)
I get them figure, like double dem digits
My niggas got heart
I got dem niggas fiennin
All dem niggas just preein'
They ain;t go'tno meaning
I think their minds need cleaning

Took a flight to Glasglow
Couple beanies at the show
I got a redbone
Ayy, ayy
Trappin off a cellphone
Know some niggas that be strapped up like some Velcro
Ayy,ayy
I do it, I did it , i done it
My niggas are running
We came for the hundreds
We got the crowd jumping from nothing to something

Loads of readies
Not from Yola
Snapchat Kevin
He's serving up some orders, (what)
Meet him around the corner (flash)
Gone in a flash
Tryna get to the racks
Baby girl do the dash, I know shes trash
Hop in the Uber , I'm ready
I know she Ugly like Betty (Ugly Betty)
I think I'm sick,call a medic
They say your music is epic
I pull up on a next tip
Roll Royce X6
You was never on the guest list
London's Finest , we da best bitch
Best 3 - aliyah rock the 
Ay, yo ,ay,ay
Yeah it seems all funny
I was on the pah with some niggas who move bunny
Fucking with a honey, Couple times i slipped up  rolling my dougie
Bac of the carseat
Im just thinking about some money
My eyes on the prize
0-15 my guys started flioppin the white
I told them fuck the white ting
Man just fuck up the mic
He said fuck being broke, I;m just tryna get mine
See the hoods fucked
And the hoods pepper
Couple man turned crazy in the hood, never
Me and my bro locked it off
We used to kick back smock weed til it hot box
Shout a quick jawn, come link man
A couple man use to move silly, bare cock blocks
And now the blocks hot
She a top thot
Tell her turn over and get on top

Ayy, ohh, hold wait
Dressing up lie tihs, they gone think im Rick James
Moving too official the getting in my way
Moving one direction, they must of thought i was Zayn
Ohh, yeah, no wave
Told them they ain't in my wave
Ohh and they can't fuck with me
Real niggas from 4-14th
They rolling out, they rolling p and we been down
Cause we rolling weed, we blowing weed in that penthouse
We unruly nigga
They can't fool me nigga
And i just call me bros and let them school you nigga
Puff, puff on theese drugs  and have tis codeine
And if i ever get caught up im saying no names
Ayyy
Come on come up
Wise is nothing like these pricks, I;m and edutaed pimp
In enierrity with Wray and Nephews in my drink
If I ever wore mink
They animals are exitinct
Im not just fdapper im just mint
Im smoking on cookie and its just  I and I could look me in my eye
Im well spoken and certified
Look at the tred in my tires  baby
Thats overtime
Stuff thata use to be relevant seems so obsolete
And i just want the amg with the low seats
Low blow  weed
Im cooler than your nutty uncle  going to go theif
My team sweet, OIg's  wall steert
The mney's dirty  but i have the goals to keep it clean
Pc dividends
(Come on)
Tc ? ?
In and out of corners now
I m in order and im crossing borders so wich me well
And if he's movng jail
I clealry fcked his girl
Im backstage and my little brother stares well
Clear lenses with the gold frames
T's got Cartiers so maybe you should check your ways
Yh i got Uniqlo jeans but they look Balmain
Even how they paper sits, at least they spelt my surname
Bitch
Spell my surname bitch

O food for me
I got enemies hating on my Steez
Cause im unique, want the money, cars ,watches and da jewels
Best believe i don't work for free, I don't work for free
I need my p's
Different models every week
We be counterfeting
Yeah im eating dinner in my slippers
Wish she moves, she could be a stripper
Yeah i make her feel it in her liver
Downtown, chilling with some killers
Maybe off the liquor
Moeny getting thicker
Yeah she got a body, gotta figure
Might fuck her  and her sister
Sweet like Twister
Ice cold you can call me winter
Might fight her no Morilla
Chill like Dilla
She a go getta
Lemme get your twiiter
