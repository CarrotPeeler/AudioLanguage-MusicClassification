I can't stand the rain against my window
Bringing back sweet memories
I can't stand the rain against my window
'Cause he ain't here with me

Hey windowpane, tell me, do you remember
How sweet it used to be?
When we were together
Everything was so grand
Now that we've parted
There's just one sound that I just can't stand

I can't stand the rain against my window
Bringing back sweet memories
I can't stand the rain against my window
'Cause he ain't here with me

When we were together
Everything was so grand
Now that we parted
There's just one thing that I just can't stand
You might also like
I can't stand the rain (I can't stand the rain, I can't stand the rain)
I can't stand the rain against my window
Bringing back sweet memories
I can't stand the rain against my window
'Cause he ain't here with me

When we were together
Everything was so grand
Yeah, I know you've got some sweet memories
But there's one sound that I just can't stand

I can't stand the rain against my window
Bringing back sweet memories
I can't stand the rain against my window
It just keeps on haunting me
Hey, hey, rain, get off of my window
'Cause he ain't here with me
And I can't stand the rain against my window
Bringing back sweet memoriesEmbed
