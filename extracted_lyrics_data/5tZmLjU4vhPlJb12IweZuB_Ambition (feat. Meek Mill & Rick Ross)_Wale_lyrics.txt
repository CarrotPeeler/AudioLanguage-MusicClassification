The time is now , on everything
Took my heart away from money
Ain't not interested of fame , and I pray that never change
Ambition is priceless , that's something thats in yo veins and I put that on my name

Huh , Only hope I had was selling dope
It was on my grind cause times were harder than a cellar floor
My mamma taught me never steal but never tell'em folkes
I grew up lookin up to the niggas that was selling coke
Oh ! I was raised by the stop sign
No religion I was gettin saved by the Glock 9
By the minute , I was gettin paid like the hotline
Service raw , fiends was calling , we was dot com
Well connected , well respected and well protected
Ain't get accepted , Well rejected , And now they regret it
Ain't get my message , was no signal when I was texting
The nigga I was callin was fraud and I learned my lesson
Now I moove with agression , use my mind as a weapon
Cause chances are never given they tooken like interceptions
Now throw that pass i'll be the quarterback
Me & Folarin MMG gonn' bring that warner back !

Ambition
Easy to dream a dream, but much harder to live it
They gon love me for my Ambition
Easy to dream a dream, but much harder to live it
They gon love me for my Ambition
Easy to dream a dream, but much harder to live it
Look, they gon love me for my ambition
Beautiful music, painting pictures that be my vision

My ambition to win , Just to get me some ends
Help me pay my low rents , maybe sit in a benz
I saw mamma prayin ,as she waits on results
It was hot in the kitchen , can I wait on the porch
My father was missing , Warlord , Oliver North
Life is diggin me deeper I kept coming up short
Breaking so many laws , walkin up in the dark
Who cut my power off , it's time to moove that powder soft
Not to many options when you comin from the projects
Sittin in the trap , now you moovin Cindy Lauper
Girls wanna have fun , and them niggas want some change
& I doubt that ever change
Ambition is priceless that's somethin thats in yo veins
& I doubt that ever change
Ambition is my shit and I put that on my name
& I doubt that ever change

Well Wishes to my opposition
You nigga probablly cop a plea before you cop a pistol
I got nothing against em , they got fuckin potential
But every nigga who can read gotta get this issue
Subscribe, niggas reside where all the lions and killers be
& I ain't spent a minute up in the streets
But I'm limitless mentallly
I'm lyrically ZMT
Lebron shit , I was in that 6 after 23
& family is everything , & money is less important
Long as your mama love you , don't ever love a woman
I gotta a lot of bitches , they gotta lot of feelings
But I got that green on my eyes
And I ain't donnie Simpson
I retire your niggas , fuck you and your position
They placeholding so slippery niggas can’t even kick it
Y’all rambling, talking shit to these bitches
You know you real you don't say it
You know you real we gon feel it
