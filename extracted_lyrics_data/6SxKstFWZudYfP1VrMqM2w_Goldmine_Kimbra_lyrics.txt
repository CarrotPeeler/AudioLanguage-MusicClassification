13 ContributorsGoldmine Lyrics
You can't touch it with your two hands
You can't find it with the third eye
And I've been thirsting in the mud lands
For a well you can't run dry, oh
Passed down to me through the wind (been listening)
And in the silence of the white sound
It's always hidden in the dark night
And dug up from the cold ground

But it goes over the heart, over the head
Over and above all the words they said
Be still my heart, be still my head

Cause I got a gold mine, it's all mine
Nobody can touch this gold of mine
I got a gold mine, it's all mine
Nobody can touch this gold of mine
I got a gold mine, it's all mine
Nobody can touch this gold of mine
It's been through the brimstone, been through the fire
Nobody can touch this gold of mine

And it's burning in the furnace
And refined in the third eye
No you won't find it on the surface
It rises out of the war cry
You might also like
But this goes over the heart, over the head
Go and get past all the words they said
Be still in your heart, still in your head

Cause I got a gold mine, it's all mine
Nobody can touch this gold of mine
I got a gold mine, it's all mine
Nobody can touch this gold of mine
I got a gold mine, it's all mine
Nobody can touch this gold of mine
It's been through the brimstone, been through the fire
Nobody can touch this gold of mine

They all running to the gold rush
They all running to the river
Hey, don't speak loud, keep it hushed
Cause we're about to be delivered, ooh

Cause I got a gold mine, it's all mine
Nobody can touch this gold of mine
I got a gold mine, it's all mine
Nobody can touch this gold of mine
I got a gold mine, it's all mine
Nobody can touch this gold of mine
It's been through the brimstone, been through the fire
Nobody can touch this gold of mine
I got a gold mine
I got a gold mine11Embed
