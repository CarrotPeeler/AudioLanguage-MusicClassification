7 ContributorsRa Lyrics
Come on, the light is here
Out of the corner
The light is coming
Come on, my God it's here
Down on the stone
The light is coming

Come out, come out, come out, come out, I'm learning
Come out, come out, come out, come out, I'm loving

So long, divided come
High in the garden
Dance the 
Satin and mighty Ra

Come out, come out, come out, come out, I'm learning
Come out, come out, come out, come out, I'm loving
Come out, come out, come out, come out, I'm learning
Come out, come out, come out, come out, I'm lovingYou might also likeEmbed
