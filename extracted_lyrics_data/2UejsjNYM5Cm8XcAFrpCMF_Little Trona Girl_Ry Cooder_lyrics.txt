Little Trona girl, little Trona girl
Little Trona girl, will you wait for me?
Little Trona girl, little Trona girl
Little Trona girl, will you wait for me?

Standing in the twilight by the highway side
In my mirror I can see the teardrops in her eyes

Little Trona girl, little Trona girl
Little Trona girl, will you wait for me?
Little Trona girl, little Trona girl
Little Trona girl, will you wait for me?

Will you wait for me?
Will you wait for me?
Will you wait for me?You might also likeEmbed
