1 ContributorMy Cousin Kim LyricsKim was in the air force
He dropped fire from the air
He grabbed that heater
That was sitting in his hand
He gave it to them
And put 'em in the foreign sand
He was one hell of a man
Kim dropped fire on the people
Fire on their face and hands
He had their families
Their mothers and their kids
He said he'd "Head 'em!"
And that's just what he did

With that heater in his hand
He put it to them
In the Texas sand
He was one hell of a man

Kim was at the airport
And the faces stared at him
He grabbed that heater
Which was burning in his hand
He gave it to them
Buried in concrete!
