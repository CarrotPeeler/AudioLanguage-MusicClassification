4 ContributorsI Can LyricsGot me when I’m giving all my time
Got me when I’m down but I don’t mind
Only when I’m gone only on a moan
Got me on the ground, no I don’t mind at all
Make another run on the bone
Make the river run, no I won’t know
Only when I’m turned, only when I burn
Make it game and fun, no I won’t mind at all
I won’t mind at all
I can, I can, I can
Take another blow and I don’t mind
I can, I can, I can
Take another blow but
I’ll be standing up this time
Break another piece, even lie
Break the better piece no I won’t cry
Only on a line, only on a spine
Break it with a squeeze no I don’t mind this time
I won’t mind this time
I can, I can, I can
Take another blow and I don’t mind
I can, I can, I can
Catch anything you throw and I’ll be fine
I can, I can, I can
Take another blow no I don’t mind
I can, I can, I can
Take another blow but I’ll be standing up
You might also likeI can, I can, I can
Take another blow and I don’t mind
I can, I can, I can
Catch anything you throw and I’ll be fine
I can, I can, I can
Take another blow and I don’t mind
I can, I can, I can
Take another blow but I’ll be standing up this time
Up this time
I’ll be standing up this timeEmbed
