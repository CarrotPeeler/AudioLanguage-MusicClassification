9 ContributorsThe Seeker Lyrics
I've looked under chairs
I've looked under tables
I've tried to find the key
To fifty million fables

They call me The Seeker
I've been searching low and high
I won't get to get what I'm after
Until the day I die

I asked Bobby Dylan
I asked The Beatles
I asked Timothy Leary
But he couldn't help me either

They call me The Seeker
I've been searching low and high
I won't get to get what I'm after
Until the day I die

People tend to hate me
Because I never smile
As I ransack their homes
They want to shake my hand
Focusing on nowhere
Investigating miles
You might also like
They call me The Seeker
I've been searching low and high
I won't get to get what I'm after
Until the day I die

I learned how to raise my voice in anger
Yeah, but look at my face, ain't this a smile?
I'm happy when life's good
And when it's bad, I cry
I've got values, but I don't know how or why

I'm looking for me
You're looking for you
We're looking in at other
And we don't know what to do

They call me The Seeker
I've been searching low and high
I won't get to get what I'm after
Until the day I die1Embed
