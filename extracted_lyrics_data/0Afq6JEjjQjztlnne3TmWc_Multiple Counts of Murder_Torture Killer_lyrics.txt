1 ContributorMultiple Counts Of Murder LyricsAnother victim to slaughter, dead
Another snitch to deal with
A million times I've been betrayed
And now it's time to find my prey
A broken body, a cracked skull
Three days dead, the corpse starts to smell
Now it's time to take my revenge
On the world for wronging me
I'll fucking kill all I see
I'll just kill you to watch you bleed
I'll fucking kill all I see
I'll just kill, it's all just a game to me
One more body that needs to hang
One more person that I can rape
Another hole to cut and fuck
One more victim to have fun with
Masked for killing, I'm dressed in black
On the hunt for people I can stab
Fear the dark - it's when I attack
I woke up today and something snapped
I'll fucking kill all I see
I'll just kill you to watch you bleed
I'll fucking kill all I see
I'll just kill you to watch you bleed
