5 ContributorsSeven Tears LyricsSeven tears have flown into the river
Seven tears are runnin' to the sea
If one day they reach some distant waters
Then you'll know
It's sent with love from me
Here I stand
Head in hand
Lonely like a stranger on the shore
I can't stand this feeling anymore
Day by day
This world's all grey
And if dreams were eagles I would fly
But they ain't
And that's the reason why
Seven tears have flown into the river
Oh
My darling
Oh
My pretty lady
Golden star that leads to paradise
Like a river's running to the ocean
I'll come back to you fourthousand miles
Here I stand
Head in hand
Seven tears have flown into the river
