Suffer, many times
Felt the weakness, when I was strong
Held sweetness when it's was wrong
I've touch tight and low
But wherever I go
The road, always returns to you
My love, It still belongs to you
Seen you crying, tears of rain
I know, I cause you pain
Lef you shatter on the ground
But what matters is here and now
Cause all that I know is wherever I go
The road, always retunrs to you
My love, It still belongs to you
All the bridges that I've build are unbroken
All the memories that live come with knowing
Every thing I've never done
Every thing I've ever doneYou might also likeEmbed
