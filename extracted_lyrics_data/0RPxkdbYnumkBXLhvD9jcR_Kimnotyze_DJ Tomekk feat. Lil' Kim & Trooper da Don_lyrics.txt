8 ContributorsKimnotyze Lyrics

Gib's mir richtig, ganz egal wo

Kimmie, Kimmie, Kimmie – can't you see?
Sometimes your style just hypnotize me
And I just love your sexy ways
This is why they're broke and you're so paid
Kimmie, Kimmie, Kimmie – can't you see?
Sometimes your style just hypnotize me
And I just love your sexy ways
This why they're broke and you're so paid

I'm a big dog, ya'll don't wanna uh with me
I rule on the streets like a trucker B
Move out my way when it's time to get paid
What you know about hydraulics on a Escalade?
We hit switches like they do in Cali
'Cept we ain't in 6-4s we low ridin' Denalis
Lexus, Vipers, eating up the flow
Straight-out Swordfish with the TVR
Lil' Kim and Tomekk, we so hot, we burning
Give it to you in English, put it down in German
Gib's mir richtig, ganz egal wo
Said, "Roll right or don't roll at all!"
Now, get your walk on, get your rub on
All my Gs in the club, get your thug on
Get your name back, put your bling on
Big ballas at the bar, get your drink on
Blow the smoke out, get your steam on
Low riders hittin' switches, get your lean on
Get your name back, put your mack on
And if I hear you talkin' yak, get your smack on
You might also like
Kimmie, Kimmie, Kimmie – can't you see?
Sometimes your style just hypnotize me
And I just love your sexy ways
This why they're broke and you're so paid
Kimmie, Kimmie, Kimmie – can't you see?
Sometimes your style just hypnotize me
And I just love your sexy ways
This why they're broke and you're so paid

Kim, Ich bin horny – Gyal, ich geb' dir von vorne
Troop, Lil Kim, DJ Tomekk
Wieder werd' ich Nummer 1, wah dann, wah dann, wah dann, wah dann?
Bei dir gibt's so viel zu sehen, da gibt's keine Logik, nix zu verstehen (Nix zu verstehen)
Kimmie, willst du mit mir gehen?
Verlier' mein' Verstand, ja, das muss ich gestehen (Ah, ay)
Mein Feuer, das brennt lichterloh
Von Karlsruhe bis nach Itzehoe (Ah, yeah)
Du treibst es auf die Spitze, Hoe (Gib's mir richtig, ganz egal wo)
In der Küche aufm Herd, in der Scheune aufm Pferd
Auf dem Parkplatz derb, und danach noch mehr (Ganz egal wo)
Und ich weiß, es gefällt dir sehr
Kim, ich weiß genau, was ich tun soll
Und es ist ein tolles Gefühl, oh why
Kimmie, Kimmie, Kimmie – can't you see?
Sometimes your style just hypnotize me
And I just love your sexy ways
This why they're broke and you're so paid
Kimmie, Kimmie, Kimmie – can't you see?
Sometimes your style just hypnotize me
And I just love your sexy ways
This why they're broke and you're so paid
Kimmie, Kimmie, Kimmie – can't you see?
Sometimes your style just hypnotize me
And I just love your sexy ways
This why they're broke and you're so paid
Kimmie, Kimmie, Kimmie – can't you see?
Sometimes your style just hypnotize me
And I just love your sexy ways
This why they're broke and you're so paid

„Hahaha, ganz egal wo!“Embed
