Ain't nobody else but you
Ain't nobody else but you
Ain't nobody else but you

There is nobody who can make me cry
Nobody else can do it
Nobody but you, nobody but you
(Ain't nobody else but you)
There is nobody who can make me lie
Nobody else can do it
Nobody but you, nobody but you
(Ain't nobody else but you)

Nobody, nobody but you

Give me one more chance to make it right
Time has come for us to reunite
'Cause baby it's true
(Ain't nobody else but you)
There's no one like you

There is nobody who can make it right
Nobody else can do it
Nobody but you, you know what to do
(Ain't nobody else but you)
You might also like
Nobody, (Nobody) nobody but you

Somebody tell me
'Cause I can't eat or sleep
When you're not close to my body
Your a bittersweet delight
Come and help me through the night (nobody!)

Ain't nobody else can make me cry
Ain't nobody else can make me lie
Nobody but you
(Ain't nobody else but you)
Nobody but you
(No one can make me lie)

Give me one more chance to make it right
Time has come for us to reunite
'Cause baby it's true
(Ain't nobody else but you)
There's no one like youEmbed
