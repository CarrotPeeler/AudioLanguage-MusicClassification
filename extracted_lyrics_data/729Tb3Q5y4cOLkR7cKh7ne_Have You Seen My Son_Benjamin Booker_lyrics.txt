3 ContributorsHave You Seen My Son? LyricsYou told me that the world is full of sinners
And placed a bible at my feet
I could hardly understand you
Oh, I had just learned to chew my meat
I heard that you were calling on the Lord
Asking for answers, for some relief
I heard that you were calling out my name (my name!)
And that you cried for a whole week
Saying, "Have you seen my son?
He’s lost in the world somewhere
I pray for him every day
But I know he ain't seen your ways
(Is he alright?)"
As I got older
It never got any better
I said I’m trying to find some truth in this world
I know there’s things that you won't understand
We fought all the way from Florida
Down I-10 to New Orleans
I said God must love everyone
Even the ones the Church loves the least

She will do most anything
I know that I can never make it right
But it's hard to hear you say it
Yeah, "Have you seen my son?
He’s lost in the world somewhere
I pray for him every day
But I know he ain't seen your ways."Embed
