Moving stranger
Does it really matter?
As long as you're not afraid to feel
Touch me, hold me
How my open arms ache
Try to fall for me

How I'm moved
How you move me
With your beauty's potency
You give me life
Please don't let me go
You crush the lily in my soul
Soul
Soul

Moving liquid
Yes, you are just as water
Flow around all that comes in your way
Don't think it over
It always takes you over
Sets your spirit dancing
You might also like
How I'm moved
How you move me
With your beauty's potency
You give me life (You give me life)
Please don't let me go (You give me life, so please don't let me go)
You give me life (You give me life)
Please don't let me go (You give me life, so please don't let me go)
Oh, you give me life (Ah, you give me life)
Please don't let me go (You give me life, so please don't let me go)
You crush the lily in my soul (La-la-la-la-la, lily)
Soul (La-la-la-la-la, lily)
Soul (La-la-la-la-la, lily)9Embed
