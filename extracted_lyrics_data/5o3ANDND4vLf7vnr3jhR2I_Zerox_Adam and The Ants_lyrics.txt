5 ContributorsZerox LyricsLock up your brain
'Cause I'm here again
I'm never bored
I'll steal your chords
Ooh-ooh, Zerox machine
Ooh-ooh, Zerox machine
Give me a line
Or a middle eight
I've got the best
So I want the rest
Ooh-ooh, Zerox machine
Ooh-ooh, Zerox machine
Let's get together
Before itâ€™s too late
Collect up the ideas
And duplicate
Filling up the forms
Send them off tonight
And you'll be the owner
Of the copyright
Of the copyright
Of the copyright

Get your ears to the ground
However else can the hits be found?
I may look happy, healthy and clean
A dark brown voice and a suit pristine
But behind the smile there is a Zerox machine
(I'm a) Zerox machine
(I'm a) Zerox machine
(I'm a) Zerox machine
(I'm a) Zerox machine
(I'm a) Zerox machine
(I'm a) Zerox machine
(I'm a) Zerox machine
(I'm a) Zerox machine
(I'm a) Zerox machine
(I'm a) Zerox machine
(I'm a) Zerox machine
(I'm a) Zerox machine
(I'm a) Zerox machine
(I'm a) Zerox machine
(I'm a) Zerox machine
(I'm a) Zerox machineEmbed
