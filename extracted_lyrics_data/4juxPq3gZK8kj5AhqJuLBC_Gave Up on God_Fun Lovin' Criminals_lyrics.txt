1 ContributorGave Up On God LyricsAll these people makin' choices with no
Cause and effect check sayin' their man is
The best. But yet they don't respect they
Lie to elect. Then resent the rest. Making
God's whole world a mess I say it again. I
Make a wager that the saviour hasn't been
Back yet we got many looking skyward like
The man got a jet you see it in the
Children's eyes. Within them they reflect
The love that we forget bring me your poor
Persecuted huddled masses. Put them through
The system. And kick their asses. Try to
Figure out why the double edge slashes
While the white rich men get passes. We got
A thousand year beef that's still a problem
Since 1945 we just threaten to bomb 'em. But
Now they're bombin' back. And still we ain't
Got 'em you said. Never forget. But we've
Forgotten
Did you ever think the world would get so
Hard children killing children in our own
Back yard did you ever think you'd say that
You gave up on god
Now try and pitcure this. Through all of the
Mist we're taking out hits. Scratchin' dicks
Off the list we're itchin' to piss off
Those kicks we just lift off. The kids that
Just let off. The guns that we gift. The
Times that push cadence. Reflect all the
Ancients we try to have patience. Through
All of the hatred with all of this growin'
It's out of control. I'm sitting on my sofa
Sedated. We got a lot in the way of
Acheiving a state. That don't try to relate
The temptations of fate. And what's made us
Great? All of this blood? Is this how we
Court the houses of Saud? well we're
Sleeping with dogs. But detaining the pack
They're stealing my rights with the patriot
Act. With Washington runnin' the drugs. And
The guns in. Sometimes I thank god we got
Crack
Did you ever think the world would get so
Hard children killing children in our own
Back yard did you ever think you'd say that
You gave up on godYou might also likeEmbed
