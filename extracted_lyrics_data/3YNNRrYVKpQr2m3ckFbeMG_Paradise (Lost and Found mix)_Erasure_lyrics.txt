1 ContributorParadise (Lost & Found mix) LyricsHey, now did I tell you that I was going?
Yes, I'm leaving, 'cause there's no room in this house
You're just too much in love with yourself
Tired of living in slow motion, gonna make the bubble burst
And fill the ocean with your crocodile tears from your eyes
Instead of swimming against the tide
There are better things that a man can do
Than to waste his time on a no good fool like you
Falling into a hole like paradise
Falling into a hole like paradise
You say that you're really sorry, but sorry don't work
When you've heard it for the fifty-second time
You should be ready to say goodbye
Tired and you're dead and dreamin'
Baby who on earth do you think you're kidding?
Go and put another record on, I'm sick of hearing the same old song
Don't wanna hear your little white lies
They can break the moon and decimate the sky
Falling into a hole like paradise
Falling into a hole like paradise

Than to waste his time on a no good fool like you
I'll be going away soon, only time will tell
If I'll ever be back again
I'll be going away soon, only time will tell
If I'll ever be back again
