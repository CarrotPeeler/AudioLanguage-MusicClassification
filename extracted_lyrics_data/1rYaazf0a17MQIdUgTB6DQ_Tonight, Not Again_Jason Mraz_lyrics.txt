The night she brushed her hands upon my flushed cheek
Smelled of childhood remnants of a dusty weeping willow
Clouds soothe, shredded by the calico
We're oh so vast and quick as I was on my own now

And this time like every other time I believe that I never find
Another sweet little girl with sequined sea foam eyes
Ocean lapping voice smile coy as the brightest quiet span of sky
And I'm all alone again tonight, not again, not again, not again
Not again, not again, not again
And don't it feel alright
And don't it feel so nice
Lovely, lovely

Still I'm unable to inhale all the riches
As I'm awkward as a wound on my bones
Still I've got cobblestone joints and plate glass points
As I'm all by myself tonight not again not again
And don't it feel alright
And don't it feel so nice
Lovely

Well if you should nervously break down
When its time for the shakedown would you take it
It's when you cry just a little but you laugh in the middle that you've made it
And don't it feel alright
And don't it feel so nice
Lovely

Say it again. Lovely. So lovely. To do it again
Again. Loving again. It's coming again
