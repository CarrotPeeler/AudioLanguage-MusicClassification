The world is turning
Night has come
I'm so high
Light too bright
It feels like burning
Take me down
I'm so high
I'm so high
We're the mass
One brain to follow
Feels like God
Make a change
This is what
This is what
My one shot
Makes me feel forever
This is what
This is what
Makes me dream forever
Dream of war
The crowds are screaming
Hear my call
Say my name
I'm a whore
With so much feeling
Like before
Sold my soul
Sold my soul

This is what
My one shot
Makes me feel forever
This is what
This is what
Makes me dream foreverEmbed
