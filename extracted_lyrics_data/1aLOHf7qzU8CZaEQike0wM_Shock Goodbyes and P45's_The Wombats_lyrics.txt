11 ContributorsShock Goodbyes and P45's Lyrics
It's the sociopaths that scare me
Not the fall of my local bank
At least they're only burning money
And they won't be laughing as they're chopping off my hands

One day, I'll learn how to box clever
And beat the past back in its place
I'll never get rid of this false endeavour
But I'll wipe the grin off its dirty little face
Oh, I'll wipe the grin off its dirty little face

Why wait 'til the summertime
Just to say goodbye?
You're so infuriating
(Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)
Why wait 'til the summertime
To hand me a P45?
Was I that infuriating?
Was I that infuriating?

God knows that I don't hate you
But one day, I must learn how to
And the next, I'll learn exactly how to put up a fight

It's not the Illuminati that scares me
It's the people further down in the ranks
The creatures like you that are so controlling
As to lead a God-fearing boy out the devil's pack
Why would you lead a God-fearing boy out the devil's pack?

Why wait 'til the summertime
Just to say goodbye?
You're so infuriating
(Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)
Why wait 'til the summertime
To deflate my legal high?
Was I that infuriating?
Was I that infuriating?

One day, I'll learn how to box clever
And beat the wrongdoers away
I'll wear no mask or tight polyester
But you can rest assured, I'll be on a little-caped crusade
Oh, you can rest assured, I'll be on my little-caped crusade

Why wait 'til the summertime
Just to say goodbye?
You're so infuriating
(Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)
Why wait 'til the summertime
To hand me a P45?
Was I that infuriating?
Was I that infuriating?
(Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)
God knows that I don't hate you
But one day, I must learn how to
And the next, I'll learn exactly how to put up a fightEmbed
