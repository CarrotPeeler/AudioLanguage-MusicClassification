10 ContributorsFaster Lyrics
Haha, yeah, ok!
Uh, Ready? Set, go!

Here comes the A-Train, Mr.Fleet Feet
Savin' lives, no surprise like it's easy
There ain't no day like a race day
A-Train on the track like a raceway (Yeah)
I'm the best to ever do it, y'all crazy
Make way or you're pushing up daisies (That's right)
Bring the heat, now they're beggin' for some AC
Only place I ever lose in your daydreams
Too quick for a flick, too swift for em' (Too quick)
Hear a click, see em' burn when I get going
Bluе streak in the street nevеr tip-toeing
A-Train super sauna with the shit like
Woah, get off the road, lightning got nothin' on me when I bolt
Y'all shoot with shots but your bullets too slow
I'm on the road, straight to the dough

Faster than the speed of light
Watching as your dreams take flight
I think I should stand and fight
Then disappear into the night
Faster than the speed of light
Watching as your dreams take flight
I think I should stand and fight
Then disappear into the night
Into the night
You might also like
Yeah, ain't no after you can get that action no
Takin' back what's my life The Alamo
Baby tryna play me like a saxophone
Who ain't though? I've cracked the code
Slaying lanes and ripping roads
Y'all will never touch me like an asymptote
Presto! Yeah I'm gone in a flash
Start off soon, go and get me cash
Leave em' in the dust when I dash
You can kiss my butt when I pass gas to your mustache
A-Train second to none
If you're looking for the greatest I'm the definition
It ain't fair when I play you in a competition
I'm the king who holds the crown with no opposition

I'ma do it all my way (I'ma do it all)
Picking up the pace, I won't let them stop me (Can't do it)
Putting in the work, lie awake (Haha)
Slipstream wave kicking off my way
I'm outta here

Faster than the speed of light (Than the speed of)
Watching as your dreams take flight (Dreams take flight)
I think I should stand and fight
Then disappear into the night (Go get some)
Faster than the speed of light
Watching as your dreams take flight
I think I should stand and fight
Then disappear into the night
And I'm goneEmbed
