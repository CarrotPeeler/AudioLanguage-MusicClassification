One, two, three, go!

Mistress Mabel, seriously wrong
Clears my table badly, then she's gone
Takes a liberty if you let her
Yes she's old but she should know better
Oh dear Mabel, please don't put me on

Mistress Mabel all the kids agree
You're unstable curious and free
Wind 'em down, and then keep 'em kickin'
Sunken-eyed and all panic-stricken'
Oh dear Mabel, it still worries me

Hemline ratbag so they told her
Last night's name tag across her shoulder

Tell me where all the days have gone
When you robbed my cradle
Tell me, Mabel
Where'd you go when you can't go on with this filthy fable?
Tell me, Mabel
You might also like
Mistress Mabel, won't you marry me?
I'm unable to take it seriously
I'll be good and you'll be a minute
I wish you would or I'll drop you in it
Oh, dear Mabel won't you marry me?

Hemline ratbag so they told her
Last night's name tag across her shoulder

Tell me where all the days have gone
When you robbed my cradle
Tell me, Mabel
Where'd you go when you can't go on with this filthy fable
Tell me, Mabel

Tell me where all the days have gone
When you robbed my cradle
Tell me, Mabel
Where d'you go when you can't go on with this filthy fable
Tell me, Mabel
Tell me where all the days have gone
When you robbed my cradle
Tell me, Mabel
Where d'you go when you can't go on with this filthy fable
Tell me, Mabel1Embed
