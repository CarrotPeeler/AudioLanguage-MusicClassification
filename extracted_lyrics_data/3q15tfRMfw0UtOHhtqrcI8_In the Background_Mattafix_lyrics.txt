2 ContributorsIn The Background LyricsYes I am the boy
Who once worshipped you
As you seemed to destroy the ground beneath you
No more am I
A part of the cycle
Or the boy who once worshipped you
They don't know
Cause they don't know you like I do
You say you're back now and you
You say you want me
I don't believe you
Cause I'm on track now
You're in the background
You say you want me
Do you really?
I don't believe you
Nor do I need you
Cause you're in the background
You're in the background
Yes I know you've travelled
Over seas and rivers
But you can't come back now for there are no bridges
There's a trail of sorrow
That you revealed to
The eyes of a boy
Who once worshipped you
You might also likeThey don't know
Cause they don't know you like I do
You say you're back now and you
You say you want me
I don't believe you
Cause I'm on track now
You're in the background
You say you want me
Do you really?
I don't believe you
Nor do I need you
Cause you're in the background
You're in the background
You say you want me
I don't believe you
Cause I'm on track now
You're in the background
You say you want me
Do you really?
I don't believe you
Nor do I need you
You say you want me
I don't believe you
Cause I'm on track now
You're in the background
You say you want me
Do you really?
I don't believe you
Nor do I need you
Cause you're in the backgroundEmbed
