1 ContributorMi-O-Mai LyricsI lost my heart to a city state
I lost my mind in the middle eight
I sang sang sang to my Peggy Sue
I spoke in tongues cos I wanted to
I lost my heart to a city state
I lost my crown to a feather weight
I sang sang sand to my Peggy Sue
I tongued my back cos I wanted to
I lost my heart to a city state
I lost my mind in the middle eight
I sang sang sang to my Peggy Sue
Where is my concentration?
I lost my heart to a city state
I lost my mind in the middle eight
I sang sang sang to my Peggy Sue
I spoke in tongues cos I wanted to
I lost my heart to a city state
I lost my mind in the middle eight
I sang sang sang to my Peggy Sue
Where is my concentration?
I lost my heart to a city state
I lost my heart to a city state
I lost my heart to a city state
I lost my heart to a city
