3 ContributorsCanâ€™t Stop Now Lyrics
My mama always said if you want you should
Get in fast while the going's good
Lie on a rug if you fool around
Just don't get caught with your trousers down

Somebody stop me
Tie me down
I tell you, baby, I can't, I can't stop now

My daddy said, "Son, gotta understand"
"Don't think twice get it while you can"
"You can't hang around, you can't stand still"
"Cos if you don't take it another man will"

Somebody stop me
Tie me down
I tell you, baby, I can't, I can't stop now

I got an eye for a pretty girl
And a sweet tooth for trouble
I can't stop, can't stop, can't stop now
I can't stop cos it tastes so good
I got a sweet tooth for trouble
You might also like
No rest for the wicked, no peace of mind
When you got a jukebox heart working overtime
I maybe out of touch, maybe out of line
But, baby, you got your life, and I got mine

Somebody stop me
Tie me down
I tell you, baby, I can't, I can't stop now

I got an eye for a pretty girl
And a sweet tooth for trouble
I can't stop, can't stop, can't stop now
I can't stop cos it tastes so good
I got a sweet tooth for trouble
I can't stop, can't stop, can't stop now
I got an eye for a pretty girl
And a sweet tooth for troubleEmbed
