2 ContributorsPandemonic Outbreak LyricsChaos within Laughter of universe
Why is it a sin
To have the will to break out?
Haunted by their Master
Their holy god, their king of kings (He rules the world)
He says outbreaks are evil (Universe)
To be chained into this Lake of fire (Lake of fire)
No sanity exists (Get the ice broken)
Open eyes and truths forbidden (Will raise your mind)
All humans should obey (Time who have decayed)
Heavens gates will fetter up their souls (Now I'll gain it back)
Breaking through the circle
The circle of god
Discover your own will
And break out
Rise to get high
Weakness to deny
Why submit
Be weak and crawl?
Chaotic skies
Too unordered to fall
Lord of beyond
Lead me through the astral skiesYou might also likeEmbed
