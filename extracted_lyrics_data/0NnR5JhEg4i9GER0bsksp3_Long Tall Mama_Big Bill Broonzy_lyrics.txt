Got a long tall mama
She stands about seven feet nine
Got a long tall mama
She stands about seven feet nine
And when she get to loving
Holler papa won't you take your time

Oh when she start to loving
She sure can do her stuff
Oh when she start to loving
She sure can do her stuff
And she squeezing so tight
Holler mama lordy that's enough

Got a brand new movement
One that she calls her own
Got a brand new movement
One that she calls her own
And when she start to kissing
Make a poor man leave his home

And she do a little of this
And mama and she do a little of that
And she do a little of this
And mama and she do a little of that
And when she put on full steam
Make a freight train jump a track
You might also like
Said she's long and tall
And half as sweet as she can be
Said she's long and tall
And half as sweet as she can be
To satisfy that woman
Takes more than a bumblebeeEmbed
