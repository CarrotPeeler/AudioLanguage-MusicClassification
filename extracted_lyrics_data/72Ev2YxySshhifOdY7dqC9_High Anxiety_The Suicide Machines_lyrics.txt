7 ContributorsHigh Anxiety Lyrics
Well it's the high anxiety, a victim of society
High anxiety, a victim of society
High anxiety, my
It's my high anxiety getting to the best of me

Sometimes I feel like I'm gonna explode
When I'm approaching total overload
I know that when I'm having a panic attack
To duck and cover 'cause I can feel it coming

It's the high anxiety, a victim of society
High anxiety, a victim of society
High anxiety, my
It's my high anxiety getting to the best of me

This time I feel like I'm gonna die
Cold sweat, the fear is paralyzing
You know, I wish that this was over and done
Heart pounds, I can feel it escalating

It's the high anxiety, a victim of society
High anxiety, a victim of society
High anxiety, my
It's my high anxiety getting to the best of me

I don't know why
Sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night, I don't know why
I gasp for breath
I'm really feeling like I'm on the brink of death

I don't know why
Sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night, I don't know why
I gasp for breath
I'm really feeling like I'm on the brink of death

I wish I could get this crisis under control
Then I could feel some kind of closure
I feel this could go on and on without end
I guess I'll just have to ride it out

'Cause it's the high anxiety, a victim of society
High anxiety, a victim of society
High anxiety, my
It's my high anxiety getting to the best of me

It's the high anxiety, a victim of society
High anxiety, a victim of society
High anxiety, my
It's my high anxiety getting to the best of me
Getting to the best of meEmbed
