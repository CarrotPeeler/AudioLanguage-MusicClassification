6 ContributorsWho Was That? Lyrics
Who was that? Who was that?
Someone walked their feet through my house
Who was that? Who was that?
Someone's sneakin' quiet as a mouse
Who was that? Who was that? (Who was that?)
Someone left their shoes on the stairs
Who was that? Who was that?
Laughin' just like no one cares

Someone's in my house, I declare
Playin' cards, solitaire (Who was playin' in my house?)
Someone's in my kitchen munchin' out
Peanut butter, there's no doubt (Who was eating in my house?)
Someone took a bath, Mr. Bubble
Middle name must be trouble (Who was playin' in my house?)
Someone's on the porch, right outside
Here I come, you better hide (Who was hiding inside?)

Who was that?
Someone walked their feet through my house
Who was that? Who was that?
Someone's sneakin' quiet as a mouse
Who was that? Who was that? (Who was that?)
Someone left the radio on
Who was that? Who was that?
One minute here, now he's gone
You might also like
Who is it? Who is it?
What!?

Someone's in my house, I declare
Playin' cards, solitaire (Who was playin' in my house?)
Someone's in my kitchen munchin' out
Peanut butter, there's no doubt (Who was eating in my house?)
Someone took a bath, Mr. Bubble
Middle name must be trouble (Who was playin' in my house?)
Someone's on the porch, right outside
Here I come, you better hide (Who was hiding inside?)

Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba, ba-ba-ba
Ey, hey, yeah-yeah
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba, ba-ba-ba
Ey (Hey, hey)
Who was that? Who was that? Yeah, oh
Who was that? Ba-ba-ba-ba, hey
Who is it? Who is it?Embed
