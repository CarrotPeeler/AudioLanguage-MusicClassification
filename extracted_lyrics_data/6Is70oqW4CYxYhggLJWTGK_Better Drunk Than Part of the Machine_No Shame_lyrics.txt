2 ContributorsBetter drunk than part of the machine LyricsThey just wanna buy things
They just wanna drive cars
They just want big tits
They just wanna be stars
They just wanna look young
Look hard, have fun
Get this, Get that
Get big, Get fat
Boys want tits and girls want a**
Bling, bling, bling if your daddy's got cash
You don't have to stand outside in line
You can just go and have a real cool time
Everyone here can just drown in their own s***
I don't wanna hear another word about it
And I'm supposed to live my life with these?
Parempi kännissä ku osa niiden koneen
Who are you to stand there and moralize me?
You're not in a position to tell me a thing
You have fouled your own nest and made a mockery off my dream
Parempi kännissä ku osa niiden koneen
Burn your Visa
Smoke your cigarettes
Bleach your teeth
Have fun like violence
Talk about the movies
Talk about trends
Talk about stores and clothes and bars
Who's hot? Who's not?
Do you need a bigger c***?
Buy these stocks? Make an easy buck
Work more-buy more
We must have a lot
Do you have the membership discount card?
Consume and buy - buy and consume
Consume and buy - buy and consume
Consume and buy - buy and consume
Consume, consume, consume, consume!
Everyone here can just drown in their own s***
So go on to the dance floor and shake your a** to the mirror ball
