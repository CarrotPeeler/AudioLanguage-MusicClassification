1 ContributorBleeding Lyrics...My honest feelings...
...Can’t stop your bleeding...
And why end life?
So run
Why is life so unfair?
...Your honest feelings...
...Can’t stop my bleeding...
The preciousness of life
Locked away then set free
But still set free I start to bleed
Don’t want to hide you now
‘Cause you’re my pain
Don’t want to lose you now
This has always been
...Our honest feelings...
...Our hearts are bleeding...
The preciousness of life
Locked away then set free
But still set free I start to bleed
Don’t want to hide you now
‘Cause you’re my pain
Don’t want to lose you now
This has always beenYou might also likeEmbed
