4 ContributorsBackdoor Love Affair Lyrics
I got to have you, baby
Don't you say that you don't care
Got to have you, baby
Don't you say that you don't care
Any way you want it, baby
I'll settle for a backdoor love affair

I call you on the telephone
The party says that you ain't there
I call you on the telephone
The party says that you ain't there
When a man asked who's calling
I said, "Just tell them
It's a backdoor love affair"

Got to have you, baby
Don't you say that you don't care
Got to have you, baby
Don't you say that you don't care
Any way you want it, baby
I'll settle for a backdoor love affair
Oh, yes I will
