3 ContributorsAmazing Grace LyricsAmazing Grace! How sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me!
I once was lost, but now am found
Was blind, but now I see
Through many dangers, toils, and snares
I have already come
Twas GraceÂ brought me safe thus far
And Grace will lead me home
Good to me
His Word my hope secures
He will my shield and portion be
As long as life endures
When we've been there ten thousand years
Bright shining as the sun
We've no less days to sing God's praise
Than when we'd first begunYou might also likeEmbed
