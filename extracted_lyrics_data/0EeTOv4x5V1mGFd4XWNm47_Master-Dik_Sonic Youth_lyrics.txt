12 ContributorsMaster-Dik LyricsOne two, one two, one two titty
I know every nook and cranny in New York City
We're Ciccone and that's enough
I'm the Royal Tuff Titty and you gotta taste my love
Taste my love
Yeah
Come on everybody and rock with me
I am the one on the Christmas tree
Now whippin' out the words like a moving story
Now walking up the stairs and corkin' up the board
Trippin' anywhere, I don't fucking care
Put on some dark eyes and wave me goodbye
("said she's looking good")
C-C-C-C-Ciccone
("I know")
Yeah, yeah
I know
Gene Simmons is an ugly mother
We're Ciccone
We're Ciccone
We're Ciccone
We're Ciccone

Like a hylozoic gonna pass right through
Saying "all is one and one is too too many"
London fuck you're pissing me off
Hollywood weirdo, cough cough cough
Won't you please let me rock you
Now I'm just a boy with not much to do
Everybody says doesn't come from above
You're gonna scream when you taste my love
Taste my love
Yeah.....C-C-C-C-Ciccone...C-C-C-C-Ciccone..
Yeah we're Ciccone...
...aaaaaaaaahhhhh........
We're Ciccone...Ciccone..C-ciccone..Ciccone
