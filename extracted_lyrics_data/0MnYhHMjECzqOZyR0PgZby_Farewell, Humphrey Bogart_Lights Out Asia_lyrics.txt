2 ContributorsFarewell, Humphrey Bogart LyricsAnd I always thought I would say I'm sorry
Can you feel my heart beating?
Is it going so slow?
Why does it feel like you're before me?
Can you feel the wind blowing?
And I always thought I wouldn't give your heart up
And I feel when I'm always alone with you
