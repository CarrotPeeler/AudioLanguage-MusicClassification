1 ContributorDress Like A Pimp LyricsAre you drag? what you doing? like you never do something real
For your crack, for your wack, what your doing all the time
Your a big fat mother f*cker, and always gonna add to nothing
Maybe you should gather up, then you won't feel this way
Nothing else matters (what you say now)
Nothing else matters (go away now)
Nothing else matters (what you say now)
You gotta fight for your right
Take a good look at what you believe in
I know it ain't easy but sometimes you gotta fight for your..
Fight for your right
Take a good look at what you believe in
I know it ain't easy..
So you fight
One more time
I dont think so
I might as well let you hurt me so
Unless you
Deny me
I might find a piece of you inside me
Nothing else matters (what you say now)
Nothing else matters (go away now)
Nothing else matters (what you say now)
You gotta fight for your right
Take a good look at what you believe in
I know it ain't easy but sometimes you gotta fight for your..
Fight for your right
Take a good look at what you believe in
I know it ain't easy..
But you fight
Are you drag? what you doing? like you never do something real
For your crack, for your wack, what your doing all the time
Your a big fat mother f*cker, and always gonna add to nothing
Maybe you should gather up, then you won't feel this way
Nothing else matters (what you say now)
Nothing else matters (go away now)
Nothing else matters (what you say now)You might also likeEmbed
