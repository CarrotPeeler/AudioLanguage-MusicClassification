She's my ex
I can't cross her from my memory
She meant everything to me
She meant every word she said

When she said, "I'll never love again
Be my ex until the end
'Cause I know I'll never feel this way again"
She's just my ex

She's my ex
She marks the spot where I'm the weakest one
I can't expect she'll change her ways
Can't accept the things she's done

She's just my ex
Nothing more, nothing less
She's just my ex
Just my ex
Nothing more, nothing less
But she'll always be my ex
You might also like
She's my ex
Don't cross her path, she still belongs to me
She'll be my ex 'til I say when
Until I get her back again

'Cause I know I'll never love again
Never need another friend
And I know I'll never feel this way again

She's just my ex
Nothing more, nothing less
But she'll always be my ex


She's my ex
She'll cross my mind a thousand times today
Still have a million things to say
Guess I'm better off this way

'Cause I know she'll never love again
Be my ex until the end
And I know I'll never feel this way again
She's just my ex
Nothing more, nothing less
But she's still my ex

And I, and I
Could never kiss that face goodbye
'Cause I, 'cause I
Never stop to wonder why
She looks so pretty
She looks so pretty
And I know I'll never feel this way again

She's just my ex
Just my ex
She'll always be my ex
She's my, just my exEmbed
