3 ContributorsNobody Knows You LyricsOnce I lived the life of a millionaire
Spending my money, with never a care
Takin' all my friends out for a good time
Drinkin' high-priced liquor, champagne and wine;
Then I began to fall so low;
Didn't have a friend, and noplace to go
If I ever get my hands on a dollar again
I'm gonna squeeze it, until the eagle grins, cause
Nobody knows you when you're down and out
In your pocket, not one penny
And your friends -- you find you haven't any
But as soon as you get back on your feet again
Everybody wants to be your long-lost friend
It's might strange, without a doubt
Nobody knows you when you're down and out
When you're down and out
In your pocket, not one penny
And my old friends, haven't any
But if I ever walk on my feet again
And then I'll meet my long-lost friend
That's mighty strange, without no doubt
No man can use you when you're down and outYou might also likeEmbed
