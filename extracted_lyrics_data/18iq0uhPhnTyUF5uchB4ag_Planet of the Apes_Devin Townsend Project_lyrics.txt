5 ContributorsPlanet of the Apes LyricsI know who I am today
But who knows?
To forgive the lord... you don't damn family
All I ever wanted was to be true for my wife and my kid
And I will never back down, and I release the pain
I say have it your way
I stay heavy for my god
I say have it your way
And pay!
Oh the mind goes!
And I've had to reassess the ways of the mind
And I will never back down, for you are my children's family
And I know what's inside that power, have I forgiven the pain?
Forgive yourself!
I say have it your way
I stay heavy for my god
I say have it your way
Pay! No?

(While we all have lots of bands who influence still, we all rip off Meshuggah!)
Well was I aware that I was more uplifted by the enkindled smiling of the stars
So I cannot find myself worthy
Covered with scent vile they seem to be side by side, animals in a row
I never (get your money's worth)
Pay pay
I never know (get your money's worth)
Pay now
I do not agree existentially
I know father, I know father, I know, I know
I know father, I know father, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know, all about the blood!
Yeah! I let go, I let go my prehistoric mensa!
I say have it your way
I stay heavy for my god
I say have it your way
I stay heavy for my god
I say have it your way
I stay heavy for my god
I say have it your way
I stay heavy for my god
Worlds away, sun it glows
Hearts fade to grey, summer shows
Worlds away, sun it glows
Hearts fade to grey, summer shows
Way of ways, and in a way I'm heading toward the sky!
We never will die, we never know why
Just never hold back now, and I'll be happier still!
Oh! Everybody will know, I am so happy now!
I've got a little boner!
Stay in line, in line we stay!
Stray from the norm and never be heard!
Always above, always alone!
Reaffirm:
This is the planet of the apes!
(Jesus, Jihad. Jesus, Jihad. Jesus, Jihad. Jesus, Jihad. Jesus.)
Show ourselves the beauty of our ways
Then maybe we would last
Hey!
Are we observing? Are we the observed?
Are we deserving, or are we deserved?
If what we owe is all we know!
Then ever in the presence of events that change us all, and then are gone
If they know, what we may never know
Then let this be the lesson of our ways!
(Jesus, Jihad. Jesus, Jihad. Jesus, Jihad. Jesus, Jihad. Jesus.)
Please don't cry to me, cause what you believe is the cause of your own demise
You need to be free in money and the worlds between us! Your words, they say this!
Under the pleasant lines!
I'm sorry baby, I'm sworn to miles and miles of love
I'm sorry baby, I'm sworn to miles and miles of love
I'm sorry baby
Baby
Miles and miles of love!
One is all connected, tungsten body glowing mind!
One collective!
Wild desire!
All the world's been waiting for the news!
Save me your heart!
We must trust in ourselves my friends!
One is all connected! Tungsten body glowing mind!
(One is all, collective)
(One is all, collective)
(One is all, collective)
(One is all, collective)
(One is all, collective)Embed
