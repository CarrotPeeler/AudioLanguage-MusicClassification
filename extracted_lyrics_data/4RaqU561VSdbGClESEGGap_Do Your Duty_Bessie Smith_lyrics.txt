3 ContributorsDo Your Duty LyricsIf I call three times a day, baby
Come and drive my blues away
When you come be ready to play
Do your duty!
If you want to have some luck
Give your baby your last buck
Don't come quackin' like a duck
Do your duty!
I heard you say you didn't love me, baby
Yesterday at Mrs. Brown's
I don't believe a word she said
She's the loudest woman in town, oh babe!
When I need attention at home
I'll just call you on the telephone
Come yourself, don't send your friend Jones
Do your duty!
If my radiator gets too hot
Cool it of in a lotsa spot
Give me all the service you've got
Do your duty!
If you don't know what it's all about
Don't stand around my house and pout
Do you catch your mama kippin' out?
Do your duty!
You might also likeAs you make your own bad heart
That's the way o' life!
You bunk out, I'm sleepin' by myself
You're too dumb to realize, oh babe!
I'm not tryin' to make you feel blue
I'm not satisfied with the way that you do
I've got to help you find somebody to
Do your duty!Embed
