2 ContributorsYou Always Gotta Go Lyrics
Tell me what it is
That you see in me
‘Cause I need to know
If you’re heart is really into it
It seems to me at times
You really care
But the times when we’re alone
I feel as though I’m wrong

When I reach to hold you in my arms
You always pull away & say
“Don’t rush this feeling”
But lady you know that I need your love
So baby stay
I’ve tried so hard to wait
Patiently, patiently
Now I wanna know the truth
When the heat is on
Why do you run, why do you run

You always gotta go
Baby why don’t you stay awhile
You always gotta go
Don’t leave me this way lady, na come on
You always gotta go
Oh sugar when the heat is on, lady
You always gotta go
Don’t leave me this way, don’t leave me this way
You might also like
Don’t play with my mind
You should know by now
That I’ll do anything just to havе
A little taste of you, tell mе what to do
I need your love baby listen
But you turn away when I mention
All the thing I wanna do
Oh, but you call me when you’re in need lady

You always find the time for us to wine and dine
But you’re never in the mood
When it comes down to me and you
Now tell me if I’m wrong speak to me, speak to me
Now I wanna know truth, when the heat is on
Why do you run, why do you run, why do you run, why do you run

You always gotta go
Hey baby why don’t you stay awhile baby
You always gotta go
Don’t do me this way, I need your love baby
You always gotta go
Come on sugar, when the heat is on lady
You always gotta go
Don’t do me this way, don’t leave me this way
You always gotta go
Hey baby why don’t you stay awhile baby
You always gotta go
Don’t leave me this way, don’t do me this way sugar
You always gotta go
I need your love lady, na come on
You always gotta go
Oh, don’t you stay with me baby, why don’t you stay, why, why don’t you stay awhile

Don’t do me this way
Don’t do me this way, naw
Don’t leave me this way, no
Don’t leave me
Don’t you ever, ever leave me

You always gotta go
I need your love baby, stay awhile, stay awhile
You always gotta go
Don’t do me, don’t leave this spot, be with me, I need your love, baby can you stop teasing me
You always gotta go
Hey, yeah, why don’t you stay awhile
You always gotta go
You always making plans with me, but when the heat is on you gotta run from me
You always gotta go
Gotta go, gotta go, gotta go
That’s what you say baby
You always gotta go
Gotta go, gotta go, gotta go
Oh
You always gotta go
You Gotta go, gotta go, you gotta go, gotta go baby
When I need some love you never wannaEmbed
