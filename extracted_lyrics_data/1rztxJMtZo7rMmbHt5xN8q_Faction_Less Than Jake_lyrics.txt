And I, I wonder if you'd understand
If I said I'll never go, never go along again
And if I told you all that I believe in and gave you all my reasons
And always had an answer, an honest answer for all of it

Sometimes you just want to belong
At any loss or any cost
Yeah, sometimes you just want to belong

And I, I've made mistakes before
But I just can't remember, remember them anymore
And I've followed everyone's lead before
And I've made my own desicions, never felt so strong before
I've never felt so strong before

Yeah, sometimes you just want to belong
At any loss or any cost
Yeah, sometimes you just want to belong
Yeah, sometimes your best defense
Is a good reminder of your common sense
Oh yeah, sometimes you just want to belong

So strike a match and hope it lasts
Here's to following your own lead
Strike a match and hope it lasts
Here's to following your own lead
Its the path that I have taken
(So strike a match and hope it lasts)
After all the contemplation
(Here's to following your own lead)
It's the promise I have made
(So strike a match) I hope it lasts
I hope it lasts

Sometimes you just want to belong
At any loss or any cost
Yeah, sometimes you just want to belong
And sometimes your best defense
Is a good reminder of your common sense
Oh yeah, sometimes you just want to belongEmbed
