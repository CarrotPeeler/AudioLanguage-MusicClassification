2 ContributorsSouthwards LyricsThe feelings I had for this place once unknown
Remain as feelings I fear, rather than a place to feel home
And while seasons keep dying I already stopped trying
To get emotions in line everytime your eyes hit mine
It's decisions I've made that caused both love and hate
For all that I am, for all that I am
For all that I'm not, for ways that I cut
For every feeling I choked and the promises I broke
But to live - not survive - it's just impossible
But to live - not survive - as a part of this place
Is only bearable while I'm awaySee â€‹The Flatliners LiveGet tickets as low as $39You might also likeEmbed
