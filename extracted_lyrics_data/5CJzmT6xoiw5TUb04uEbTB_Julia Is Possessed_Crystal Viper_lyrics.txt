2 ContributorsJulia Is Possessed Lyrics
Can you help her, please?
It's our guilt
Do what shall be done
We know you killed
Dear reverend, save her soul
She won't be the devil's doll!
It's the only way
We know the price
But what can we do?
Just see her eyes!
In god's name we should act
She's possessed, it's a fact

Does she need to die, our girl?
Maybe there is a way
She means the whole world to us, you know!
Just give us one hope's ray

Julia is possessed! Listen to me!
We should kill her
And let it be!
You might also likeCan't you see them, demons of the night?
Dark and nasty
They will not hide!
Only death will save her soul!
I know what to do
So now let's pray
I did it before
Do what I say
Yes, maybe she will die
I don't know, I won't lie!
Candles, sacred cross
My weapons are
God is with me, yes
He is not far
Holy book and the stole
The demon will pay toll

Does she need to die, our girl?
Maybe there is a way
She means the whole world to us, you know!
Just give us one hope's rayEmbed
