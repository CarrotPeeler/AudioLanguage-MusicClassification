All that I'm hearing from you, is white noise *white  noise*
White noise *white noise*
All that I'm hearing from you, is white noise *white noise*
White noise *white noise*


If looks could kill
I'd be in trouble right now
Time stands still, when you're around
I can give you all my time, you gave me all your lies
You've just come around, to say goodbye

Now here we stand, with our hearts in our hands
Squeezing out all the life
All that I hear, is a message unclear
What else is there to decide

All that I'm hearing from you, is white noise *white  noise*
White noise *white noise*
All that I'm hearing from you, is white noise *white noise*
White noise *white noise*
White Noise
You might also like
You promised me your soul
But then left me in the cold
No warning and without, a reason
You're placing yourself in a world of mistrust
Making excuses, it's not you it's us
Well how can something unspoken seem so loud?

All that I'm hearing from you, is white noise *white  noise*
White noise *white noise*
All that I'm hearing from you, is white noise *white noise*
White noise *white noise*

The operator comes on the line
Said, 'Hurry up man 'cause you ain't got much time
White noise
White noise


All that I'm hearing from you, is white noise
All that I'm hearing from you, is white noise
WHITE NOISE
White noise *White noise*
White noise *White noise*
(All that I'm hearing from you...
Is White noise *White noise*
White noise *White noise*) x3
All that I'm hearing from you...3Embed
