1 ContributorTomorrow Never Comes LyricsNo doubt in mind, I'm running wild
I see the angels fly
All ups and downs, let's drink out every cup
Swallow it all, I hate the consequences
And I never want to see
Believe it, tomorrow never comes
It's easy when tomorrow never comes
It's only an illusion but it seems to be ok
The hardest part is waking up one day
All drowns in pain, everything hurts
I've seen my anger die
What used to be is just a memory
Reality has brought me to my knees
And now decay is here to stay
Believe it, tomorrow never comes
It's easy when tomorrow never comes
It's only an illusion but it seems to be ok
The hardest part is waking up one dayYou might also likeEmbed
