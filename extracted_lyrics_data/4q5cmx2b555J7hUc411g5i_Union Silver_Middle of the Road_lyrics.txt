1 ContributorUnion Silver Lyrics
"Look at her" my friend said
Pointing down the road
"You can tell by how she looks
She wears a heavy load"

So, we stood and watched her
Didn't say a word
But she must have read our thoughts
For this is what we heard

Union silver has taken my whole life
From my teens to the sixty years I'm living now
Lord, have mercy on me
Come and look upon me
Make a smile show once more on my face
Union silver is gone before it's made
And I could feel my shoes won't wear the winter cold
Can you tell mе, my friend
Where it's all gonna end
'Cause union silver doesn't want to know?
Oh, Lord, I'm

Then we walked on by her
Leaving her alone
Not a word was spoken
As we made our way back home
You might also like
To this day I see her
See her standing there
A mining town, a miner's wife
With coal dust in their hair

Union silver has taken my whole life
From my teens to the sixty years I'm living now
Lord, have mercy on me
Come and look upon me
Make a smile show once more on my face
Union silver is gone before it's made
And I could feel my shoes won't wear the winter cold
Can you tell me, my friend
Where it's all gonna end
'Cause union silver doesn't want to know?
Oh, Lord, I'm
