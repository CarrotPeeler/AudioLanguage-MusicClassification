1 ContributorRose Colored Stained Glass Windows LyricsAnother sleepy Sunday
Safe within the walls
Outside a dying world
In desperation calls
But no one hears the cries
Or knows what they're about
The doors are locked within
Or is it from without...
Looking through
Rose colored stained glass windows
Never allowing the world to come in
Seeing no evil and feeling no pain
Making the light as it comes from within
So dim, so dim
Out on your doorstep
Lay masses in decay
Ignore them long enough
Maybe they'll go away
When you have so much
You think you have so much to lose
You think you have no lack
When you're really destitute
Looking through
Rose colored stained glass windows
(Stained glass windows)
Never allowing the world to come in
(They won't let it come in)
Seeing no evil and feeling no pain
(They'll feel no pain)
Making the light as it comes from within
So dim, so dim
(The light's so dim, the light's so dim)

Rose colored stained glass windows
Never allowing the world to come in
Seeing no evil and feeling no pain
Making the light as it comes from within
So dim, so dimEmbed
