1 ContributorLights Out LyricsI make 'em flow
They nice now
She  lookin' fo'
That lifestyle
I'm True Penguin
You iced down?
Get dark, baby
We lights out! (Sheesh!)
I don't think they ready... (Turn 'em off)
I'm too cold!
We right now
Let's get dark (Y'all ready?)
Let's hit it!
All I hear is money from future profits (prophets)
Keep them strippers out of my pockets (Shit!)
Head Bob, and no Costas
Got the whole room smellin' like Rastas
Came through the back door with my partners
Green room no impostors
Security they don't watch us
No, Invicta niggas can't clock us
Shit, I'm a different type a' hungry
Like my club's ham and bananas
Platinum, all in my standards
I'm that shit baby, no pampers
Oh! no Cam for these panthers
Bet we take a poll (pole), she prolly turn dancer
Damn I'm pissed off, but no pistol
Cuz I miss ballin' my hands up
Excuse me, where are my manners? (Sheesh!)
The name's Mr. Reign and it's nice to meet ya
Ain't the first time crazy, I'm shinin' lately
Cuz like a blind lady, you been feelin' my features
Fuck preachin', I'm glass reachin'
I ain't worried bout you niggas on the ave beefin'
I'm knee deep in my early weekend
Watchin shawty Diplo like it's Mad Decent
Woo - I'm so wavy
Sleep on a nigga like he so ravey
And I'll pull em on stage, make 'em dive in the rage
Like Lights Out! Y'all can't phase me
Haterade don't keep me hydrated
Remy neat, that's how I take it
I'm so fly, my flow style
Let's show them how we flow baby!
You might also likeI make 'em flow

She lookin' fo'
That lifestyle
I'm True Penguin
You iced down?
Get dark, baby
We lights out!
I'm too cold
I'm right now
Let's get dark
It's lights out!
I got my entourage
Boss Ari-I
Gs (geez) and you know I'm the R-E-I
G-N you know why the party fly
Got a few bad bitches, only hardly bi (bisexual) (Sheesh!)
Rum, vodka, whiskey bourbon
And some shit that taste like dish detergent
Pourin' Patron, Jaeger (Jaegermeister), bitch it's curtains (swag)
I'm so focused, it's for certain
Types like me:
Hi Fi (high fly)
Straight Gs, like there ain't no WiFi
Funny how 24 fly by
But I never see Zs, I'ma Y's guy (wiseguy)
Livin' backwards I'mma rise high
Rooftop infinity pool, my flow don't stop
I pity the fool who don't know hip hop in the 9-5 ('95)
Nah fuck that we still golden
Biggie in the iPod, still cold (Damn!)
Now I hear bass, make a killer like Master Ace, be like this is what I'm Born to Roll in
Don't front you know I got ya' open
Shawty in the club sippin' shots of potion
Deez lames jealous cuz they not as potent
You ain't even on my radar, you're not opponents
Wooo, I'm so ill
I ain't even braggin'
I'm just talkin' real
We tryna to see whats crackin'
Hows that connection feel
My game ain't never laggin'
You already know the deal
So just ante up (up the ante) with stacks in (Sheesh!)
I make 'em flow
They nice now
She lookin' fo'
That lifestyle
I'm True Penguin
You iced down?
Get dark, baby
We lights out!
I'm too cold
I'm right now
Let's get dark
It's lights out!
I step off the plane, the car service grabbin' bags
Yeah I'm straight with the W-I-N ("I ain't") even gotta ask
A quick switch of my stitches, I'm lookin' fresh in my threads
Then I'm back out on my grizzly can't bear (bare) to look at my bed
I'm on my grind, you can see me spark
Pull up to the club and park
See the line set up the block
Shady McCoy, on ya marks
Get, set, go, get that green
Switched cities, not teams
Bout to get niggas in this shit wilin'
At the same time, pretties in this bitch Irene
I move E (ecstacy) (iMovie) no more cuz the Final Cut was too deep for me to feel Premier
Most of y'all ain't get it, but what I said is that my end credits ain't nowhere near
Like Lights Out, it's amazin'
Fans in the front row ragin'
I close my eyes, it's outrageous
I can still see the words in these pages
Then that beat drop, like we clumsy
Everyone smell the Marley (weed) in the air
I ain't the one gassin' but I'm here
Every single one of them glasses right there, I'mma guzzle
Don't get it twisted, I still hustle
Why ya camp cramp when I pull muscle?
Tonight I ain't I here to tussle
I'm just here to trust you with the knowledge we floatin', yeah!
I make 'em flow
They nice now
She lookin' fo'
That lifestyle
I'm True Penguin
You iced down?
Get dark, baby
We lights out!
I'm too cold
I'm right now
Let's get dark
It's lights out!Embed
