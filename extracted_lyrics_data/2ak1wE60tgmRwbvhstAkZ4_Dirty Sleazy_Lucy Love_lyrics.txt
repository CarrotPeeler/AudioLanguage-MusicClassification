2 ContributorsDirty Sleazy LyricsI like to st st st stumble on a beat
But not like humpty dumpty never clumsy on my feet
Cos i'm hotter than boiling porridge i'm strong like mustard
And i like to chop my words up like banana 'n custard
I am the cat's pyjamas i'm the bee's knees
Not the crème de la crème no i'm the cream cheese
You know that i mash mc's like mushy peas
This is the sound of lucy love coming from overseas
Cos it's so
Easy peasy lemon squeezy writing rhymes is oh so easy
Keep it sharp or maybe cheesy super clean or dirty sleazy
My rhymes stick to you like bubble gum
No you can't get rid of me because i'm extra troublesome
So get out of the way before i burst your bubble son
There aren't any bullets in this barrel but my words can still stun
I've got ants in my pants i'm like a billion sticks of dynamite
With the infinite power to make you die tonight
You might think this is nonsense yeah you might think this is true
It's the sound of lucy love and it sticks like glue
Cos it's so
Easy peasy lemon squeezy writing rhymes is oh so easy
Keep it sharp or maybe cheesy super clean or dirty sleazyYou might also likeEmbed
