4 ContributorsIn Her Eyes Lyrics
She stares through my shadow
She sees something more
Believes there's a light in me, she is sure

And her truth makes me stronger
Does she realize
I awake every morning
With her strength by my side

I am not a hero
I am not an angel
I am just a man
Man who's trying to love her
Unlike any other
In her eyes I am

This world keeps on spinning
Only she steals my heart
She's my inspiration, she's my northern star

I don't count my possession
All I call mine
I will give her completely
To the end of all time
You might also like
I am not a hero
I am not an angel
I am just a man
Man who's trying to love her
Unlike any other
In her eyes I am

In her eyes I see the sky and all I'll ever need
In her eyes time passes by and she is with me
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh

I am not a hero
I am not an angel
I am just a man
Man who's trying to love her
Unlike any other
In her eyes I am
In her eyes I amEmbed
