3 ContributorsAll the Pennies LyricsLeaky faucet, creaky floor
We don't even own a bathroom door
The sofa set is nothing to be jealous of
We don't have a lot but there's no shortage here for love
All the pennies in the wishing wells
All the diamonds Tiffany's could sell
All the riches put together
All the sunny California weather
Could not make me love you any better
You could give me all that I request
If you fancy, darling be my guest
But I'll take less if more means having less of you
Who needs sequin shoes or private jets to Katmandu
All the pennies in the wishing wells
All the diamonds Tiffany's could sell
All the riches put together
All the sunny California weather
Could not make me love you any better
I don't need your money
Just your kisses and your funny faces
Which I miss when you're away
I cry into my pillow
Stay up late until you bring me takeout
We make conversation all about
You might also likeAll the pennies in the wishing wells
All the diamonds Tiffany's could sell
All the riches put together
All the sunny California weather
Could not make me love you any betterEmbed
