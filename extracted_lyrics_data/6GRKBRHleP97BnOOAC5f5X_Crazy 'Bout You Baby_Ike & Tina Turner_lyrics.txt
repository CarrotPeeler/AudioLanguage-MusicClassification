4 ContributorsCrazy â€™Bout You Baby LyricsOoh!
I can't sleep at night. I cat nap thru the day, can't go on much longer babe, I can't live this way
You know I'm crazy bout you baby and I wonder do you ever think of me
You know I'm wild about you baby, and you don't care, nothin in the world for me
You know it ain't but one thing baby, sittin next to your favorite drink, but to hear you say you don't love me, then I begin to think, cause now you know I'm so crazy bout you baby
You know I'm crazy bout you baby and I wonder do you ever think of me
You know I'm wild about you baby, and you don't care, nothin in the world for meYou might also likeEmbed
