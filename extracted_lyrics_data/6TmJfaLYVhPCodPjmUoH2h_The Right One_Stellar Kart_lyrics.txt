3 ContributorsThe Right One LyricsIt's time to say goodbye
Mistreated one too many times
Mistakes that I have made
Along with these tears will fade
Away in time
Some day I'll find
The right one
My own shooting star
That someone
Who won't break my heart
And I'll wait forever until we meet
You're one in a million
The right one for me
It's time to start again
Pick up the pieces and begin
I don't need anyone
To tell me what I should become
I want more
I'm still waiting for
Say hey for the one in a million
Say hey for the one that's right
Say hey for the one in a million
Say hey for the 1 2 3 4You might also likeEmbed
