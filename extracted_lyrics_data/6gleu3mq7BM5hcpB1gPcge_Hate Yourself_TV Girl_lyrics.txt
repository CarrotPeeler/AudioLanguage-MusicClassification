26 ContributorsHate Yourself Lyrics
You, you'd fall in love with anyone
I think you'd fall in love with anyone
Who fell in love with you
And they frequently do
So take comfort
Cruel comfort
Before you start to wonder
How you got locked inside your room

And how long will it
Take before you start to hate yourself and go
Straight to the arms of someone else and I'll just
Wait 'til those arms belong to me and I'm not
Saying that you love me
I'm not saying any
Thing

Tell me, do you let them down gently?
Does it only make it harder?
To let the feeling linger
To drag it out a little longer
Does it put your mind at ease?
But you're the one who brought 'em here
You're the one who has to take 'em when you leave
You might also like
And how long will it
Take before you start to hate yourself and go
Straight to the arms of someone else and I'll just
Wait 'til those arms belong to me and I'm not
Saying that you love me
I'm not saying any
Thing

And how long will it
Take before you start to hate yourself and go
Straight to the arms of someone else and I'll just
Wait 'til those arms belong to me and I'm not
Saying that you love me
I'm not saying any5Embed
