1 ContributorThe Coo Coo Bird LyricsOh the cuckoo she's a pretty bird
She warbles as she flies
She never hollers coo coo till the fourth day
Of July
Gonna build me log cabin
On a mountain so high
So I can see Willie as he goes on by
Well I've played cards in Texas
And I've played cards in Maine
Oh I'll bet you five dollars I'll beat you
Next game
Jack of Diamonds Jack of Diamonds
Oh I know you of old
You robbed my poor pockets of silver and gold
Rye whiskey, rye whiskey
Oh I know you of old
You robbed my poor pockets of silver and gold
Sometimes I feel much younger
Sometimes I feel so old
Sometimes the warm sun shines sometimes it's
Dreadful cold
You might also likeOh the cuckoo she's a pretty bird
How I wish she was mine
She never drinks water she only drinks wine
Oh the cuckoo she's a pretty bird
She warbles as she flies
She never hollers coo coo till the fourth day
Of JulyEmbed
