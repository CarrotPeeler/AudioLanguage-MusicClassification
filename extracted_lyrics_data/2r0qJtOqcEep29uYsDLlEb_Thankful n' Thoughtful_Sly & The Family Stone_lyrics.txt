8 ContributorsThankful Nâ€™ Thoughtful LyricsOh, Sunday morning, I forgot my prayer
I should have been happy, I still be there
Something could have come and taken me away
But the main man felt Sly should be here another day
That's why I got to be thankful, yeah, yeah
I gotta be thoughtful
Hey, hey, hey, oh, thankful, thank you, oh oh oh oh
You gotta be thoughtful
From my ankle to the top of my head
I've taken my chances, hah, I could have been dead
I started climbing from the bottom, oh yeah
All the way to the top, uh-huh, uh-huh
Before I knew it, I was up there
You believe it or not
Thankful...thoughtful
Thankful...thoughtful
Oh, something gets me, hah, put my head on tight
Because I know in the future, everything'll be all right
Until then, now I will kick back and let the light shine
Remember all yours coulda been all mine
And that's why you ought to be thankful
Hah, hah, you ought to be thoughtful
Well well well, hey, thankful
Ow-ho-ho, thoughtful

I say I put it on the good foot, and it ain't no joke

And I kept on feelin' I had to live some more
I had somethin' to tell y'all
To be thankful, well well, ha
You oughta be thoughtful

Still rectifying, yeah, and straightening things out
I know what a good feelin' you're never in doubt
Sometimes I'm by myself, feelin' alone
I just look around and check it out and then it's all gone
I'm still happy to be here
Thankful...thoughtful
You ought to be thankful
You got every reason to in the world

Record "Thankful and Thoughtful," be such a nice thang
