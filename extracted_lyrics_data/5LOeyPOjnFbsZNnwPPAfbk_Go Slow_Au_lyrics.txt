2 ContributorsDIAMOND LACED 24K CASKET CASE LyricsYung Slaughter
(Arrough)
Crawling straight out the grave
(Oh, eh)
Watch your step boy, don't chat clout
Don't come at me, face some Demons
Coz you know what I be bout
Been out here suffering ages
Hey
Lost in the madness
Dragged through the sadness
(Urrgh)
What the fuck doing moaning, bitch
(What?)
Move like a wolf, 'cept alone with it
Move like I'm creeping through the night
Eye on the scope down the barrel of a sight
It's fun when time collapses
Hey
Just a couple then a few
And then a few go slow mo like
Auurgh, auurgh, auurgh, auurgh
Pass out
In my nightmares, I don't run
(Nah)
Hell knows, I'mma chase em Demons just for fun
(Yuh)
Diamond laced 24k casket case
I'mma drip on my way to crypt
Don't trip
When you carrying my coffin
It's a party at the cemetery, errone invited
Errone indited for a crime against a god
Don't call a reverend, call a reaper coz the Demons showing up
Yeah, that's the gang
That's the gang-gang
Showing up with them red eyes
No love
Keep it low with them eye lids
Blunt tucked
Keep it low with them eye lids
Then I go slow mo
Stumbling like I'm choking on the smoke
Of just about a thousand burning bodies
In the furnace of the crematorium
Give or take a few
Jack the ripper, H.H. Holmes
Surgical precision when I shoot its only head shots
Auurgh, auurgh, auurgh, auurgh
Barking like a Kalashnikov
Auurgh, auurgh, auurgh, auurgh
Hey
Just a couple then a few
And then I watch time collapse like
Watch time collapse bitch
I don't give a fuck, while I'm crawling out the coffin, bitch
Slaughtering shit, I put the law up in a trench
I start a war, I'm dropping bombs
Making bacon while I'm ballin round the block
I got about a hundred shots, you know I'm gonna take em
Little Mary in my pocket all the time
I got the diamonds on my casket case
You know I'm doing fine
My shit's high and I'm bind to the hate
Who, who, who
I don't see em
I'm a Demon
I'm a menace to society
A threat
Nah, I don't know a lot about sobriety
Ha, ha, ha, ha
Sit upon a throne of leaves
Ha, ha, ha, ha
Everybody running from the Demons that I chase for fun
Horror on their faces while I'm laughing
Got that shit all wrong
Face some Demons, face some fears, errbody sing along
Face some Demons, face some fears
Pass out
In my nightmares, I don't run
(Nah)
Hell knows, I'mma chase em Demons just for fun
(Yuh)
Diamond laced 24k casket case
I'mma drip on my way to crypt
Don't trip
It's a party in the coffin
Got it pimped out like a Don
Russian roulette just for fun
Got the diamonds on the casket case
But it ain't closed for long
Demonic, I speak in tongues
Like hocus pocus, bring the cauldron, get it lit
(Get it lit)
Did you think this was a song
When I was speaking all this madness
Spitting hexes like obliviate your mind quick like a lobotomy
When I shout it's a controversy
Don't wanna be Ash, lower me into the dirt and let me be
Hey
Auurgh, auurgh, auurgh
Auurgh, auurgh, auurgh
Hey
Pass out
In my nightmares, I don't run
Hell knows, I'mma chase em Demons just for fun
Diamond laced 24k casket case
I'mma drip on my way to crypt
Don't trip
