How come I feel lost in isolation?
My brain is a dumb submarine
Dumb submarine, dumb submarine
My brain is a dumb submarine
Never descending into the ocean
Into the o
Into the o
Into the ocean
One is alone
Two is devotion
Look out below
'Cause I am diving down
I am diving down
Dumb submarine, dumb submarine
Beneath the waves it is so serene
So I'm descending
Into the ocean
Into the o
Into the o
Into the ocean
One is alone
Two is devotion
And I am diving down (look out below, look out below)
Inside of my dumb submarine, dumb submarine
Is there another dumb submarine
Who is diving down?
You might also likeSurface again glistening all around
Sunlight bending into what I've found
A new friend and we are diving down
Inside of our
Dumb submarines, dumb submarines
Isolation can be something obscene
So we're descending
Into the ocean
Into the oh
Into the oh
Into the ocean
One is alone
Two is devotion
Look out below
We are diving (look out below, look out below)
We are diving
We are diving
Down
We are diving
We are diving
DownEmbed
