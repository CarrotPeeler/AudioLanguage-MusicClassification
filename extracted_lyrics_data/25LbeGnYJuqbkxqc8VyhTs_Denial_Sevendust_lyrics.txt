What? Never say what you mean
All I hear is a scream
Never say that to me
Never say that to me
Wait, wipe that shit off your face
Let's not stop 'til we bleed
The more you spit out your mouth
The less I believe

Denial seems it had to come
Relied on me to say it all
Denial has left you all alone

How can all that shit that you said
Ever make any sense?
Where did you run to, bitch (Bitch)
While I was holdin' my breath?
What's sacred faded into nothin'
Never put that on me
Never put that on me

Denial seems it had to come
Relied on me to say it all
Denial has left you all alone
Denial seems it had to come
Relied on me to say it all
Denial has left you all alone

Denial seems it had to come
Relied on me to say it all
Denial has left you all alone
Denial seems it had to come
Relied on me to say it all
Denial has left you all aloneEmbed
