4 ContributorsHope to Die Lyrics
Never wanted to live like this
Never understood why
All my life nothing ever worked out
Think I lived a lie
Told him not to touch me again
Said I was a liar
Said I never did anything wrong
But I knew that everything was wrong

Now I'm lying on a cot
Staring at three walls
The bars that separate me and the world
Melt away the scars
Can't see why I should stay
On this earth too long
Now I take off my bra
And I sing this song

Cross my heart and hope to die
Can't go on I tell you why
Eighteen hours too late for me
Now I hope to die with the 36C
You might also like
Now I tell you why
I was stopped for a speeding ticket
I was so embarrassed
I was a happy homeworker in my sheltered world
All the shame forced me to kill and join the other girls
Jane Russell and Marilyn will greet me
Won't mistreat me!

So I had to wrap the straps around his neck his neck his neck
Underwires get tighter and tighter
As his eyes get wider and wider
You wouldn't like me when I, huh!
You wouldn't like me when I, huh! Huh!
You wouldn't like me when I'm angry!


Cross my heart and hope to die
Can't go on I tell you why
Eighteen hours too late for me
Now I hope to die with the 36CEmbed
