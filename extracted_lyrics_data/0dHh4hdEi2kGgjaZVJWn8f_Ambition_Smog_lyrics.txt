‘Cause I'm on my way
In your bedroom
Just on the highway
Came in through your window
I think I'd throw your ribbons on the way
I never use doors no mores
I never use stairs just trees
And I hear their voices
Breaking up from down below
The toe
I just dropped by to see you
Cause I'm on my way
In your bedroom
Just on the highway
Say, are you still tight with that pharmacist
Well I've got to get there
Now don't I
And when I get there
I've got to sleep well
Now don't I
And when I wake up in the morning
Gotta wake up in the morning
Now don't I
When I meet with them
Gotta be on the ball
Now don't I
When I do their dirt
I've get to feel numb
Now don't I
When it's all said and done I
I just got to celebrate
Now don't I
When I'm done celebrating I
I just have to unwind
Now don't I
