1 ContributorHIGHBALL Lyrics
I think i’m gonna glow, she gives me so muchs blows
Bros before hoes, she don’t give a fuck like i’m running for my own, i’m flying like a drone
She's sniffing coke in Portland and her nose are from Detroit

I’m gonna kick your fucking ass
Watch your back ayy
You try to get me in your trap
Apple pie
I’m gonna kick your fucking ass
Watch your back ayy
You try to get me in your trap
Apple pie

She thinks she can fuck me
In the backseat for my rollie
I’m tryna get that bitch get off me
Drugs all in my brain, i love it
You think imma going to run
Fuckin this bitches alone
Louis vuitton are my coat
You can bring another one
Oh my god is a lot of pills
I think i’m going never sleep
I just want to make you squirt
Drinkin henny after this
I’m movin in the club
I think i’m going never stop
I just pop some belair rose
You always talking shit
You’re done?
I think i’m in the space
Omg, is just the race
Taking some xanax before we pop off the jet
Recordin a bitch while we having sex
You’re jealous just seeing my bands
Get up there
This nigga drunk too much henny, he’s going insane
I put her on 4, i’m on the road, fuck, this nigga is too low
I will break your fuckin bones, i have party in my boat
Take some notes, selling drugs
Remember that I'm the boss, give me some, i just cut the coke, selling dope
You might also like
I’m gonna kick your fucking ass
Watch your back ayy
You try to get me in your trap
Apple pie
I’m gonna kick your fucking ass
Watch your back ayy
You try to get me in your trap
Apple pie

I think i’m gonna glow, she gives me so muchs blows
Bros before hoes, she don’t give a fuck like i’m running for my own, i’m flying like a drone
She's sniffing coke in Portland and her nose are from Detroit

Travel the world
Full of ammo
Stay there in Netherlands makin a blunt
Feed me with drugs
Never give up
I just want she give me a blow
Drivin a benz, better get rest, 200 hundred thousand the price of my jet
Fly in private, playing some game, laughing and laughing before i get dead

I think i’m gonna glow, she gives me so muchs blows
Bros before hoes, she don’t give a fuck like i’m running for my own, i’m flying like a drone
She's sniffing coke in Portland and her nose are from DetroitEmbed
