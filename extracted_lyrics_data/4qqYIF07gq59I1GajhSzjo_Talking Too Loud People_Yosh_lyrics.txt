1 ContributorTake Me Back Lyrics
Wait... It's the kidsnextdoor
Yoh, let's get them nigga
(Westside, Westside)

Ke tshwere varnac
Spice sa mzoko before di memeza
'Fore the bad girls bare tsenyetsa stress
'Fore the black kids hated being black
Girls used to love our six packs
Now It's black card, shaya Cashback
Haosa shape Cashback, take a back step
'Fore you get treated like a Ben 10
Uh, this ones takes me back like my еx-girl
I got four scars, I got backstabbed
I done seen lot of niggas turn to bad gents
But you know wе sanitize, we don't wanna touch gems
Eish, nigga been through hell
But I came with a fire on these projects
Hope my nigga Theo still play me on the North West(s)
Hope they heard a nigga, I can't really take a no fuckin rest
You don't know how you broke my heart
I'm talking about to my dad with that first scar
I can't really love, I'm a bad son
I know you been streaming nigga, 'cause you heard I rap now
You know what I'm doing, I been tryna cover background
Aiming for some rands, just to buy momma house
Maybe outta ghetto, for some better life
Wanna see my people happy, wanna get them butterflies
You might also likePeople finna talk when you go up
They will still talk when you fall down
Rather keep the whole city showing fake love
I can't hear these people talking, 'cause you know my music loud
Beefing with my neighbours, 'cause I play Drvx
(For playing Drvx)
But too loud
But the whole zone vibe when drop, son
(When I drop some)
They too proud
