1 ContributorHeavy Metal - More than Meets the Eye LyricsFeel the power
That hides before your eyes
A veil of conformity
Kills the wraith of all
Just close your eyes - what can you see
Leave all behind - what can you hear
Just close your eyes - what can you feel
Rising above with me
And there ain't no more boundary
Nor space for elapsed melancholy
A heart of steel assigns you to the pact
A bond between brothers, impossible to break
Heavy Metal - more than meets the eye
Never trust your eyes
Common feel the fire
Feel the heat
The spirit of the flame
Oh oh oh oh - what can you see
Oh oh oh oh - what can you hear
Oh oh oh oh - what can you feel
Oh oh oh oh - and feel the steel
