9 ContributorsEverything Iâ€™m Not Lyrics
Oh no, don't go changing
That's what you told me from the start
Thought you were something different
That's when it all just fell apart

Like you're so perfect
And I can't measure up
Well, I'm not perfect
Just all messed up

I was losing myself to somebody else
But now I see
I don't wanna pretend, so this is the end
Of you and me
'Cause the girl that you want
She was tearing us apart
'Cause she's everything
Everything I'm not

It's not like I need somebody
Tellin' me where I should go at night
Don't worry, you'll find somebody
Someone to tell how to live their life
You might also like
'Cause you're so perfect
And no one measures up
Yeah, all by yourself
You're all messed up

I was losing myself to somebody else
But now I see
I don't wanna pretend, so this is the end
Of you and me
'Cause the girl that you want
She was tearing us apart
'Cause she's everything
Everything I'm not

Now wait a minute, because of you
I never knew all the things that I had
Hey, don't you get it?
I'm not going anywhere with you tonight
'Cause this is my life

I was losing myself to somebody else
But now I see (Now I see, yeah)
I don't wanna pretend, so this is the end
Of you and me (The end of you and me)
'Cause the girl that you want (That you want)
She was tearing us apart
'Cause she's everything
Everything I'm not
But now I see
I don't wanna pretend, so this is the end
Of you and me
'Cause the girl that you want
She was tearing us apart
'Cause she's everything
Everything I'm not1Embed
