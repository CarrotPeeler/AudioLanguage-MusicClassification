2 ContributorsWhen Your Body Gets Weak Lyrics
Tonight, I'm gonna hold you
I'm gonna touch you, and lay you down
Tonight, I'm gonna kiss you
I'm gonna taste you, all the way down

Tonight, you don't have to be lonely
You need only to call me
And I will be down

When your body gets weak
And you need some affection, oh baby
I'll lay you down (I'll lay you down)
When your body's in need
And you need some attention, oh lady, yes
I'll lay you down
I'll lay you down

Tonight, when I've been inside you
I'll lay down beside you, and stay all night long, yes I will
Tonight, I just want you to teach me
Girl, I just want to please thee
So just let's get it on, baby
You might also like
Tonight there be no intermissions
I have only one mission
That's turning you on, ooh...

When your body gets weak
And you need some affection, oh baby
I'll lay you down (down, down, down)
When your body's in need
And you need some attention, oh lady
I'll lay you down
(I'll lay you down, baby; I'll lay you down)
I'll lay you down

Tonight, you don't have to be lonely
You need only to call me
And I will be down

When your body gets weak
And you need some affection, oh baby
I'll lay you down (I'll lay you down)
When your body's in need
And you need some attention, oh lady
I'll lay you down
(I'll lay you down, baby; I'll lay you down)
I'll lay you...
I'll lay you down, darling, I'll lay you down
I'll lay you down, yeah, yes, yeah yeahEmbed
