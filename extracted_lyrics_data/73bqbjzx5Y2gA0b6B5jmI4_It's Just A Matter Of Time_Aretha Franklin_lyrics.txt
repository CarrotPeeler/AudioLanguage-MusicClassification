Someday, someway, you'll realize that you've been blind
Yes darling, you're going to need me again
And it's just a matter of time
Go on, go on until you've reached the end of the line
Because I know that you'll pass my way again
And it's just a little matter of time

After I gave you everything I had
You laughed, you laughed and you called me a clown
Remember in your search for fortune and fame
What goes up is coming down

I said I know
And that something you did to me makes me know
That someday you'll wake up and find
That my love was a true, true love
And it's just a matter of timeYou might also likeEmbed
