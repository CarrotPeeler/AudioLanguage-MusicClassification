1 ContributorFalling Down Blues Lyrics
Got the blues so bad it hurts my feet to walk
Wouldn't hate it so bad but it hurts my tongue to talk

Oh, I feel like jumping through a key hole in your door
I could jump so easy your man will never know
Some people say the wary blues ain't tough
But if they don't kill you they will handle you mighty rough
He took my boggy settled up my black mail
Going to find my woman, going to go somewhere
She caught the rambling I caught the falling down
But I'll never see her never turn around
