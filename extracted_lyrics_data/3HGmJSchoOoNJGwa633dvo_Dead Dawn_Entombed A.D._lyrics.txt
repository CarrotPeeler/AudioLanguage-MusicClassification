1 ContributorDead Dawn LyricsIn the cellar slowly worming
Feeding growing pain and fear
Occupied with greedy hoarding
Without thinking what is there
Final blast inferno on the way
The rolling of the dice
Like sheep in panic running astray
Extermination quick on site
Plastic ocean concrete haze
Concluding dead dawn
Eradicated this the end of days
Into the open hole
No one seeing what is coming
Monkey chatter fills the air
It matters not no point in running
Armageddon fire sear
Total blast inferno on the way
Last rolling of the dice
Like sheep in panic running astray
Exterminated crushed as lice
Plastic ocean concrete haze
Concluding dead dawn
Eradicated this the end of days
Into the open hole
You might also likeAnd all that's on your mind
Hog as much as you can find
You'll command and rule
What a joke total fool
No running away
No reason to pray
No place to roam
All that remains
Is dust and bone
Plastic ocean concrete haze
Concluding dead dawn
Exsanguinated this the end of days
Into the open holeEmbed
