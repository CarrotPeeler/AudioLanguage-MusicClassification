8 ContributorsMoon Lyrics
I watch you spin from afar
I drink you in and breath you out
I'm camouflaged by the timeline
I'm camouflaged when the sun shines

Two ships passing in the night
Two lips pressing ground the tides

I believe the world it spins for you
We will never be, I am the moon
I believe the world it spins for you
We will never be, I am the moon

I long to be apart
I isolate my heart
You've drawn me into your world
Now I too spin limbless

One wide hand clapping where's the wind
I stand snapping at your distant wings
You might also like
I believe the world it spins for you
We will never be, I am the moon
I believe the world it spins for you
We will never be, I am the moon
I believe the world it spins for you
We will never be, I am the moon2Embed
