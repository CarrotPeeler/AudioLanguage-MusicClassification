Walking on a line
I feel like I'm walking
Walking on a line
Do i believe in love?
No, sorry
You want to live by my side
Oh oh oh
But sometimes it's not easy for me
Come on, let's go back in time
Endless kisses, endlessly
We were so young, we're so young
A word of wisdom: forget all about me
And get me out of your mind
But you're not my kind
And I ain't so special
Yes, you're not my kind of girl
You say you'll be fine
Your life is a spiral
Come on, let's go back in time
I feel like I'm walking on a line
Come on, let's go back in time
I feel like I'm walking
Come on, let's go back in time
I feel like I'm walking on a line
Come on, let's go back in time
I feel like I'm walking
Walking on a line
I feel like I'm walking
Walking on a line

No, sorry
You want to live by my side
Oh oh oh
But sometimes it's not easy for me
Come on, let's go back in time
Endless crisis, shame on me
Make a promise and be strong
A word of wisdom: forget all about me
And get me out of your mind
But you're not my kind
And I ain't so special
Yes, you're not my kind of girl
You say you'll be fine
Your life is a spiral
Come on, let's go back in time
I feel like I'm walking on a line
Come on, let's go back in time
I feel like I'm walking
Come on, let's go back in time
I feel like I'm walking on a line
Come on, let's go back in time
I feel like I'm walking
Walking on a line
I feel like I'm walking
You'd better give up honey
I feel like I'm walking
You'd better give up honey
Walking on a line
I feel like I'm walking
Walking on a line
I feel like I'm walking
Walking on a line
Walking on a line
Walking on a line
You'd better give up honeyEmbed
