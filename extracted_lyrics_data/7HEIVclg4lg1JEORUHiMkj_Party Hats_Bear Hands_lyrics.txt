6 ContributorsParty Hats LyricsThe gold standard of mammals is who?
The warm water is finally here
The new scandal is dance is the worst
But the future is nothing to fear
The whole planet is going to war
The same countries are fighting back tears
The doomsayers are making it count
But the future is nothing to fear
It could be days, it could be months
It could be years, it could be fun
You're not the only one, you're not the only one
All our eyes been, staring at the sun, smoke fills up both my lungs
Blind and violent that's the way it's done, now you know where we come from
I start writing a warning for what?
To prove to who our conscience was clear
The few animals left all bought guns
But the future is nothing to fear
Now I understand how we have lost
Control over the celestial sphere
No use making the world lose trust
Because the future is nothing to fear
You might also likeIt could be days, it could be months
It could be years, it could be fun
You're not the only one, you're not the only one
All our eyes been, staring at the sun, smoke fills up both my lungs
Blind and violent that's the way it's done, now you know where we come from
All our eyes been, staring at the sun, smoke fills up both my lungs
Blind and violent that's the way it's done, now you know where we come from
(Now you know where we come from)
Now you know where we come from
(Now you know where we come from)
Now you know where we come from
(Now you know where we come from)
Now you know where we come from
(Now you know where we come from)
Now you know where we come fromEmbed
