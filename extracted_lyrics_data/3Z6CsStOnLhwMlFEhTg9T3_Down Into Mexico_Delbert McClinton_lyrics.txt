3 ContributorsDown Into Mexico Lyrics
There was a casino out in Vegas
Had a million dollars on the wall
Got my imagination workin' overtime
I knew I had to have it all
I knew I had to have it all

Sherrie was a dancer, she was a schemer
We came up with a fool-proof plan
She was workin' it from the inside
And I was her getaway man
Yeah, I was her getaway man

Takin' it deep down into Mexico
No turnin' back once you go down that road
Just one place for a desperate
Desperado to go
Deep down into Mexico
Deep down into Mexico

It all went smooth and sweet as honey
We got it all and nobody got hurt
Me and Sherrie, we were countin' our money
When that gun slid out of her purse
That little gun slid out of her purse
You might also like
That's when she told me 'bout her lover man
That's when I knew I was in a terrible mess
She took the blame, he took the money
I took a bullet in my chest
I took a bullet in my chest

Takin' it deep down into Mexico
No turnin' back once you go down that road
Just one place for a desperate
Desperado to go
Take it deep down into Mexico
Deep down into Mexico
Deep down into Mexico
Deep down into Mexico
Deep down into MexicoEmbed
