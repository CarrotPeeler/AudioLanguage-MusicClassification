Some other spring I'll try to love
Now I still cling to faded blossoms
Fresh when worn, left crushed and torn
Like the love affair I mourn

Some other spring, when twilight falls
Will the nights bring another to me?
Not your kind, but let me find
It's not true that love is blind

Sun shines around me
But deep in my heart it's cold as ice
Love, once you found me
But can that story unfold twice?

Some other spring, will my heart wake?
Stirring to sing love's magic music
Then forget the old duet
Can love with some other spring?

You might also like
Sun shines around me
But deep in my heart it's cold as ice
Love, once you found me
But can that story be told twice?

Some other spring, will my heart wake?
Stirring to sing love's magic music
Then forget the old duet
And love with some other spring?Embed
