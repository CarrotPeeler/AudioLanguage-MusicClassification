2 ContributorsSally Gets High LyricsWho are you when you wake up
Where are your claws and make-up
What did you take home with you
What comfort does it give you
When Sally gets high, yeah she wants you to see her
She's living out loud cause it's all for the theatre
You can join any time, but she won't let you leave her
Sally, who are you
The sunshine feels like burning
Night stays alive with curtains
All makes for strange bedfellows
Should you spit or did you swallow
When Sally gets high, yeah she wants you to see her
She's living out loud cause it's all for the theatre
You can join any time, but she won't let you leave her
When Sally gets high, yeah she wants you to need her
Sally, who are youYou might also likeEmbed
