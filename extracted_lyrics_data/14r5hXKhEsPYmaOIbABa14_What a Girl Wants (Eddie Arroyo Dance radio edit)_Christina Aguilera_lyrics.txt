3 ContributorsWhat a Girl Wants (Eddie Arroyo Dance Radio Edit) Lyrics
I wanna thank you for givin' me time to breathe
Like a rock, you waited so patiently
While I got it together
Oh, while I figured it out (Yeah, yeah)
I only looked but I never touched
'Cause in my heart it was a picture of us
Holdin' hands, makin' plans
And it's lucky for me you understand

What a girl wants (Yeah), what a girl needs (Yeah)
Whatever makes me happy and sets you free
And I'm thankin' you for knowin' exactly
What a girl wants, what a girl needs
Whatever keeps me in your arms
And I'm thankin' you for givin' it to me

What I want is what'cha got (Ooh, yeah)
And what'cha got, is what I want

There was a time I was blind
I was so confused (Yeah, yeah)
Run away just to hidе it all from you
But baby, you knew me bettеr
Mmm, than I knew myself, love
They say if you love something, let it go (Let it go)
If it comes back, it's yours, that's how you know
It's for keeps, yeah, it's for sure (Oh)
And you're ready and willing to give me more than
