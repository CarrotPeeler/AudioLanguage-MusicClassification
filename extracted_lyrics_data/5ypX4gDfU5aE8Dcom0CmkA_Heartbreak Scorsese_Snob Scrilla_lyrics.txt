2 ContributorsHeartbreak Scorsese LyricsSee I was born in like 84
She was born in like 83
I was like her sheree you more
But she was more like my shiela e
Never could take off my cool
To show her what she deserved to see
Loved music more then her
And that's why she deserted me
And the day she was moving on
She said things change and the love was gone
I'm like how, I'm the same old sean
She said that's the problem, your the same old sean
And she was right, one year went by
She called me with tears in her eyes
The day that she married the perfect guy
I'm like dam
There I go again
Everytime they love me
I break em in the end
Nothing I can do about it
So lets not pretend
We both know I'll always be
Heartbreak scorsese
I'll never change (x9)
Untill the day that I die
No one will be this way
I remember you came in high
Man we were so horny
Jack moves to our hearts content
Not cos we need it
Becuase we want it
We rocked the freshness off it
Then we go hit the store
Untill that pale cool lense
Brought flashing lights to my front door
And now she's screamin, and now she's cryin
Cos I been scheming and I been lying
And I know that I failed you now
Yeah I know that I did you wrong
But please get the cash come bail me out
Cos I'm sorry mom
Dam, there I go again
Everytime they love me
I break em in the end
Nothing I can do about it
So lets not pretend
We both know I'll always be
Heartbreak scorsese
I'll never change (x9)
Untill the day that I die
No one will be this way
Heartbreak scorsese
Dam, there I go again
Everytime they love me
I break em in the end
Nothing I can do about it
So lets not pretend
We both know I'll always be
Heartbreak scorsese
I'll never change (x9)
Untill the day that I die
No one will be this wayYou might also likeEmbed
