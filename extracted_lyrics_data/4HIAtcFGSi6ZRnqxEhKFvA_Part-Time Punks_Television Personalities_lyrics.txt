Walking down the King's Road
I see so many faces
They come from many places
They come down for the day
They walk around together
And try and look trendy
I think it's a shame
That they all look the same

Here they come
La la la la la la
La la la la la la
The Part Time Punks
Here they come
La la la la la la
La la la la la la
The Part Time Punks

Then they go to Rough Trade
To buy Siouxsie And The Banshees
They heard John Peel play it
Just the other night
They'd like to buy the 'O' Level single
Or "Read about Seymour",
But they're not pressed in red
So they buy The Lurkers instead
You might also like
Here they come
La la la la la la
La la la la la la
The Part Time Punks
Here they come
La la la la la la
La la la la la la
The Part Time Punks

They play their records very loud
They pogo in their bedroom
In front of the mirror
But only when their mum's gone out
They pay five pence on the buses
And they never use toothpaste,
But they got Â£2.50
To go and see The Clash
Tonight

Here they come (here they come)
La la la la la la
La la la la la la
The Part Time Punks
Here they come
La la la la la la
La la la la la la
The Part Time Punks
The Part Time Punks
