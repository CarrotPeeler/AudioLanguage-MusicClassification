5 ContributorsSomethingâ€™s Missing LyricsIt ain't your TV
Though it's fun to laugh at people sometimes
It ain't your computer
Though it's nice to spend the whole night online
It's not your movies
I see the same damn storyline
It's only music now
It's only music now

I'm not alone, I wish I was
Cause then I'd know, I was down because
I couldn't find, a friend around
To love me like they do right now
They do right now

I'm dizzy from the shopping malls
I searched for my joy, but I returned it all
It doesn't help the hunger pains
And a thirst I'd have to drown first to ever satiate

Something's missing
And I don't know how to fix it
Something's missing
And I don't know what it is
No I don't know what it is
At all
You might also like
When autumn comes, it doesn't ask
It just walks in, where it left you last
You never know, when it starts
Until there's fog inside
The glass around your summer heart


I can't be sure that this state of mind
Is not of my own design
I wish there was an over the counter test for my loneliness
For my loneliness like this
Something's missing
And I don't know how we're ever gonna fix it
Something's missing
And I don't know what it is
I don't know
I don't know
I don't know
Something's different
And I don't know what it is
No I don't know what it is
Friends, check
Money, check
A well slept, check
Opposite sex, check
Guitar, check
Microphone, check
Messages waiting on me when I come home, check

And I don't know what it is
No I don't know what it is
