4 ContributorsIntense Thing LyricsNow it's too late to be using my mind, yeah!
To reason with you would be far too kind, yeah!
It's all coming down like the dark on the town, yeah!
The cold stings my tearstained face, yeah!
So now it's all over, It's much too late to say 'Oh no'
I try not to echo everyone's dream, yeah!
But they don't exist or so it seems, yeah!
They just live inside of me, yeah!
But it's too dark I can never ever see you
And now it's all over, it's much too late to say 'Oh no'
Oh, she looked so lovely, standing on her own
Oh, she looked so lonely, standing all alone
She looked at me as she closed the door, yeah!
A stare so cold, but what for? - yeah!
I fell in love as she crossed the floor, yeah!
I need her now but she hates me more, yeah!
And now it's all over, it's much too late to say 'Oh no'
Oh, she looked so lovely, standing on her own
Oh, she looked so lonely, standing all aloneYou might also likeEmbed
