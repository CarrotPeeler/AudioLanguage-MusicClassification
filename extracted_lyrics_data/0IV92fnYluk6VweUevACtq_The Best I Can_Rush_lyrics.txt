1 ContributorModern Art LyricsI was born a bastard child
Left in baskets in the Nile
But I never learned
To stand back and watch that fucker burn
I know I'm losing control
I don't want to let it show
But I can't let things go
And I split my tongue when I asked for more
Mountained-up man must come down
All my plans ain't working out
Have I just begun?
Strap me down and launch me into the sun
At least it'd be something I'd done
For now, hollow out my heart
So we can find where the beating starts
All the rest I'll mark as modern art
Seems like every bird I held in hand
Turned me twice as hard to undеrstand
On my grave make it say, "I do the bеst I can"
With the water come rushing by
I lay me down and I close my eyes
And I tell you, brother, the river don't wonder why
