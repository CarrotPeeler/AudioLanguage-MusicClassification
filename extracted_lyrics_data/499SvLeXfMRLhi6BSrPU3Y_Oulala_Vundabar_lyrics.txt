17 ContributorsOulala Lyrics
Homeliness and loneliness are wearing to the scars
Rehash information so to tell you who you are
Definition blurs when you're staring through the smoke
Nothing really hurts when everything's a joke

I want to give it to you, I want to show you some
Ououlalalala
Ououlalalala
Ououlalalala
Ououlalalala
I want to give it to you, I want to show you some
Ououlalalala
Ououlalalala
Ououlalala
Ououou

Smart enough to make it, dumb enough to use it
Dropping to the floor when all the girlies lose it
He don't really like the taste so he cover it in salt
Taste that shit so much he don't notice it at all

I want to give it to you, I want to show you some
Ououlalalala
Ououlalalala
Ououlalalala
Ououlalalala
I want to give it to you, I want to show you some
Ououlalalala
Ououlalalala
Ououlalala
Ouououooo
