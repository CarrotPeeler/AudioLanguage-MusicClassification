11 ContributorsVoodoo Child Lyrics
Baby, baby, baby
You are my voodoo child, my voodoo child

You're like Voodoo, baby
You just take hold
Put your cards on the table, baby
Do I twist? Do I fold?

You're like Voodoo, honey
All silver and gold
Why don't you tell me my future?
Why don't I sell you my soul?

So here it comes, the sound of drums
Here come the drums, here come the drums

Baby, baby, baby
You are my voodoo child, my voodoo child
Don't say maybe, maybe
It's supernatural, I'm coming undone
Baby, baby, baby
You are my voodoo child, my voodoo child
Don't say maybe, maybe
(It's supernatural, I'm coming undone)
You might also like
You're like Voodoo, baby
Your kisses are cold
Feel your poison running through me
Let me never grow old

You're like Voodoo, honey
My pictures you stole
You play me like a puppet
Sticking pins in a doll (Sticking pins in a doll)

So here it comes, the sound of drums
Here come the drums, here come the drums

Baby, baby, baby
You are my voodoo child, my voodoo child
Don't say maybe, maybe
It's supernatural, I'm coming undone
Baby, baby, baby
You are my voodoo child, my voodoo child
Don't say maybe, maybe
(It's supernatural, I'm coming undone)

Here come the drums, here come the drums

Baby, baby, baby
You are my voodoo child, my voodoo child
Don't say maybe, maybe
It's supernatural, I'm coming undone

Baby, baby, baby
You just take hold
Don't say maybe, maybe
Do I twist? Do I fold?Embed
