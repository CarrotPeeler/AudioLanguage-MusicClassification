2 ContributorsBoys In The Woods Lyrics
Moccasin Creek (Moccasin Creek)
Haha (Haha, haha)
Demun Jones (Demun Jones)
It's the boys in the woods (Boys in the woods)
Mr. Goodtime (Goodtime) yeah

Woke up early mornin' cotton mouth like a moccasin
Late night ride was runnin' from the cops again (Yeah)
'87 heavy Chevy loaded with the lift kit
Ridin' nine miles with my dogs, don't get lit
Brahma Bull, Demun Jones and some moonshine
Waitin' for a bonehead to walk that old tree line
And if he don't show, we're headed to the waterin' hole
Catch some bluegills from a homemade fishin' pole
Take 'em to the camp, fish fry with some dirt necks
Drinkin' Hot Damn liquor drinks 'til we get wrecked
Pullin' up in an old Trans Am
Corey Dammern in the house caught some fish at the dam
Got a cooler full of bluegills that just got reeled
Two o'clock in the mornin', hot grease in the grill
Them boys in the woods run river water deep (Yeah what)
And you can catch us chillin' at the Moccasin Creek (Come on)

The boys in the woods ride mighty deep
All the way from Jones County to the Moccasin Creek
You can talk that trash and you can act all hard
But I promise you won't ever trespass in the yard
I got two Bluetick's, we got plenty of guns
Deep off in the sticks we got plenty of fun
But if you wanna get rowdy we can grant your wish
Because the boys in the woods don't take no lip
Come on

Carhartt straw hat, RedHead boot
Ready to stomp through the woods, aim and shoot
But I woke up at six too late to hunt coons
Had to settle for a deer, I skinned it with a spoon
See I knew how to swim in a creek when I was seven
Full of water moccasins on Highway 11
We played front yard football, no pads on at all
If the bone ain't stickin' out, get back up when you fall
Hail Mary every play 'til the sun went down
Barefoot kickoff, return, touchdown
JC grade GA is where I stay
Bring your manners when you come around, we don't play
Because the boys in the woods are always armed
When I put on that blaze you better ring the alarm
Your buddies ain't comin' out where we raise hell
I'm wearin' nine kinds of camo, I can't see myself

The boys in the woods ride mighty deep
All the way from Jones County to the Moccasin Creek
You can talk that trash and you can act all hard
But I promise you won't ever trespass in the yard
I got two Bluetick's, we got plenty of guns
Deep off in the sticks we got plenty of fun
But if you wanna get rowdy we can grant your wish
Because the boys in the woods don't take no lip
Come on
Breaker breaker one nine, shotgun ridin'
Front porch sippin' rebel flag stays flyin'
Coondogs with beer bellies, Hank III blastin'
Woke up in the mornin' gonna need a few aspirin
Runnin' with the boys 'round here, it's a lifestyle
Field dress 'em in the moonlight, buck knife style
Quick cracked glass packs, chewin' on some backstrap
And when it's nite-nite time, camouflage knapsack
Raised on the dogs when we drop that tailgate
Raised on them hogs, cornbread, and a hot plate
Whiskey made of corn, grape jelly from the backyard
Fresh scent, now them Beagle's runnin' like a track star
I'm on Yelvington and we let them little doe's cross
T-Wood said hold up, here comes the big hoss
Granddaddy big buck, you know that shots good
My momma must have been a tree, I was born in the woods, hahaEmbed
