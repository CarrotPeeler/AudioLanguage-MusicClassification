Yeah, this is Keith B-Rizzeal
Uh, looks like this brother, Will Smith, is just avoidin' me
But I will not be ignored, you understand?
Uh-uh-uh, 'cuse me, uh, uh-uh Will, Will!
One more question, my brother
Look, I see you brought your DJ Jazzy Jeff with you now keep it real
Are you just flauntin' DJ Jazzy Jeff around for the cameras
So you don't look like some big time bougie Hollywood sell out that you really are?
Process that, along with your hair
Keith, Keith, Keith!
Yeah, I know, Charlie
Charlie, you gonna get enough of grabbin' up on me, manSee Will Smith LiveGet tickets as low as $78Embed
