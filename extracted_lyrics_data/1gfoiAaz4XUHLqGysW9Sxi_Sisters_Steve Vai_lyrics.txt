4 ContributorsSisters Lyrics

They walk through life together
With a deep and respectful understanding
They laugh and cry together with
The most complete sincerity
Through each other's victories and defeats
Glories and humiliations
Euphorias and depressions, they will
Grow and evolve together
Even in death, their hearts and souls
Will be filled, for there are futures that
Await them
They are each other's perfection
And totality
They are the perfect pair
They are sistersYou might also likeEmbed
