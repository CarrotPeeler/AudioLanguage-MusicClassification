Go!

Corrosive, tainted by my sin
I'm spillin' blood and I can't
Hardly contain it
Corrosive, hallowing the hand
Stiffened, I eat away, eat (yeah!)
Eat into the surface

Yeah, you push it
Yeah, you push it
Yeah, you push it
You, you push it
You, you push it
You, you push it

Explosive, more violent, more violent
All consuming, throbbing (go!)
Straight to the circle
Explosive, move on reaction
I slow it down, I slow it (yeah!)
Down, down, down, down, down
You might also like
Yeah, you push it
Yeah, you push it
Yeah, you push it
You, you push it
You, you push it
You, you push it

I see it, I need it
I see it, I need it
I see it, I need it
I see it, I need it
I see it, I need it
I see it, I need it
I see it, I need it
I see it, I need it

My mind is corrosive, I trip
On corrosive, I freak, see through me
My eyes are explosive, I feed
On it, black out, crucify me

Yeah, you push it
Yeah, you push it
Yeah, you push it
You, you push it
You, you push it
You, you push it
Yeah, you push it
Yeah, you push it
Yeah, you push it
You, you push it
You, you push it
You, you push it3Embed
