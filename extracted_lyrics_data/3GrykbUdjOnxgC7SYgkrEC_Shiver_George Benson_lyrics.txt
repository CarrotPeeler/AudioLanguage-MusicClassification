Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo-doo, doo, doo-doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo-doo, doo, doo-doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo

From the moment that I see you
Chills run down my spine
Your smile is mesmerizin'
And soothes me like sweet wine

(Ooh) With you is where it's warmer
I never want to leave
So come on, girl, let's closer
I want to breathe when you breathe

You make me shiver
Girl, your love is such a sweet sensation, ho-oh
You make me shiver
Baby, when you're here with me, it's fascination
You make me shiver
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo-doo, doo, doo-doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
Shiver
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo-doo, doo, doo-doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo

When we're dancing close together
Wrapped up in our bliss
My heart is racing and anticipating
The magic in your kiss

(Ooh) We share a special feeling
I hope the music never ends, mmm
With you love takes on new meaning

You make me shiver

Feels so real, better than a fantasy
When we're so close together
