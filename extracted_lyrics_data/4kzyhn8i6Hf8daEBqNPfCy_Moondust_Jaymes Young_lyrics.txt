28 ContributorsMoondust Lyrics
I'm building this house on the moon
Like a lost astronaut
Looking at you like a star
From a place the world forgot

And there's nothing that I can do
Except bury my love for you

The brightness of the sun will give me just enough
To bury my love in the moondust
I long to hear your voice, but still I make the choice
To bury my love in the moondust

Nothing can breathe in the space
Colder than the darkest sea
I have dreams about the days
Drivin' through your sunset breeze

But the first thing that I will do
Is bury my love for you
You might also like
The brightness of the sun will give me just enough
To bury my love in the moondust
I long to hear your voice, but still I make the choice
To bury my love in the moondust

I'm a castaway and then reap what they sow
And I say what I know to be true
Yeah I'm livin' far away on the face of the moon
I've buried my love to give the world to you

The brightness of the sun will give me just enough
To bury my love in the moondust
I long to hear your voice, but still I make the choice
To bury my love in the moondust
I've buried my love in the moondust, yeah28Embed
