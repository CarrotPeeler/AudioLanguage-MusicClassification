2 ContributorsUptown Up Lyrics
Bright lights, big city, sometimes a pity
The hustle-bustle, the nitty-gritty deep in the city
Take a look around, frown upon every face
A can of mace is up under the waist, just in case
So fax me, tax me a hundred dollar bill
It takes skill to give 'em your money straight at will
Sales pressure, the need to succeed 'til you bleed
Constant struggle to get more than you need

My speed is Mach 1 like Top Gun
As I cruise the ferry with no ordinary Tom, Dick or dime
Trump-tight 'til late at night, from party-hoppin' in Gotham
Freak show time to clubs in cotton
So take a flight on the wild side, but keep it in stride
Schizo city so much, you can call it Jekyll and Hydе
Divided by the green, I mean
Morе box tops than scrapers in town, so put a green thumb down

Uptown, ooh
Uptown up, uh, ooh
Uptown up
Uptown up in the NYCYou might also likeEmbed
