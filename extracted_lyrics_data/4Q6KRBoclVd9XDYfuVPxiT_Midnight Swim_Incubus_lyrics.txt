3 ContributorsMidnight Swim Lyrics
A midnight swim
Is what I'm needing
A careless will
A fast for feeding

I take to the deep
Where the lights been til now
Got to break out and find
What the day left behind

So into blue
Begin an ark
The man was you
True and spark oh

I take to the deep
Where the lights been til now
Got to break out and find
What the day left behind

Nah, no
No, no, no
Whoa, no, no, no
Whoa, no, no, no
Whoa, ah
See Incubus LiveGet tickets as low as $54You might also like
Water and salt
Secrets like new
Arrive salt
A midnight swim

I take to the deep
Where the lights been til now
Got to break out and find
What the day left behind

Nah, no
No, no, no
Whoa, no, no, no
Whoa, no, no, no
Whoa, ah1Embed
