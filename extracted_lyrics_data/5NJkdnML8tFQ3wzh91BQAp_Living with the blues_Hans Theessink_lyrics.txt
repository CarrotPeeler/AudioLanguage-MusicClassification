2 ContributorsLiving with the blues LyricsRocks is my pillow, cold ground my bed
Blue sky my blanket, moonlight my spread
I'm not ashamed, ain't that news, I've been living with the blues
You ever been down? - You know how I feel
Feel like an engine, ain't got no driving wheel
I'm not ashamed, ain't that news, I've been living with the blues
Rocks have been my pillow, cold ground been my bed
Blue skies have been my blanket, and the moonlight's been my spread
Have you ever been down? - You know how I feel
Feel like an engine, ain't got no driving wheel
I'm not ashamed, ain't that news, I've been living with the blues
'Cause rocks have been my pillow, cold ground has even been my bed
Blue skies have been my blanket, and the moonlight's been my spread
Don't believe I'm sinking, look what a hole I'm in
Don't believe I love you, look what a fool I've been
I'm not ashamed, ain't that news, I've been living with the blues
Mama had 'em, papa had 'em too
I've been living with the blues
I'm not ashamed, no friends ain't that news, I've been living with the blues
I've been living with the blues
I've been living with the bluesYou might also likeEmbed
