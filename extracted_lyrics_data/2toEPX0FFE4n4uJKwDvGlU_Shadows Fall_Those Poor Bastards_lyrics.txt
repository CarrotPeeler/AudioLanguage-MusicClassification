1 ContributorShadows Fall LyricsI went out walkin'
Beneath that waning moon
Got tired of sittin'
With my memories in an empty room
I looked down
And I couldn't help but notice
Shadows fall
Wherever I go
Shadows fall
In the dirt or snow
Shadows fall
Wherever I go
Shadows fall
I took a six gun
And aimed it at my head
The birds were singin'
But I couldn't tell
What they said
If I had a heart
It'd break in two
If I still had tears
They'd fall for you
But all I've got
Is my shadow on the floor
You might also likeA dog went limping
Down that endless road
I took my six gun
And I shot that poor beast down
I watched him fall
And it made me feel so hopeless
Shadows fall
Wherever I go
Shadows fall
In the dirt or snow
Shadows fall
Wherever I go
Shadows fall
If I had a heart
It'd break in two
If I still had tears
They'd fall for you
But all I've got
Is my shadow on the floorEmbed
