Oh, Willy, use a Billy; don't be silly
Oh, baby, sex is joy, but use a Billy Boy
Oh, Willy, use a Billy; skilly Willy
A Billy for your thrilly joy
Oh, use a Billy Boy
I want a Billy Boy

So you want sex, sex, sex with your ex
And it won't cost you any tax
But, Willy, you better care for sure
And use a Billy with your long
Ding dong, ding-a-dong
She'll find out you're the number one
So go, man, go and use your toy
But not without a Billy Boy!

Oh Willy, Willy use a Billy; don't be silly
