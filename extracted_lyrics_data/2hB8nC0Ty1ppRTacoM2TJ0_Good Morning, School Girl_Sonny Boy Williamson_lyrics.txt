Hello, little school girl
Good mornin, little school girl
Can I go home with you?
Can I go home, later wit' you?
Now, you can tell yo' mother an' yo' father, um
That Sonny Boy's a little school boy, too

I woke up-a this mornin'
I woke up-a this mornin'
Lord, an' I couldn't make me no
Lord, I couldn't make me no town
Well, but I didn't have no blues, woman
But I was all messed up an' down

Now, you be my baby, mm
Come on an' be my baby, mm
I'll buy you a diamond
I'll buy you a diamond ring
Well, if you don't be my little woman
Then I won't buy you a doggone thing

I'm gon' buy me a airplane
I'm gon' buy me a airplane
I'm gon' fly all over this land
I'm gon' fly all over this land's town
Don't find the woman that I'm lovin'
Then I ain't goin' to let my airplane down
You might also like
I do no hollerin'
I do no hollerin'
Baby, what in this world, I'm gon'
Baby, what in this world, I'm gon' do
Well, that I don't wan' never hurt yo' feelin'
Or either get mad at what you'll doEmbed
