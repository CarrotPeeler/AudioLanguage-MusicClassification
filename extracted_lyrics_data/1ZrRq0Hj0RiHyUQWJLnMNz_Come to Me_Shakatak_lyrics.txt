6 ContributorsNot the Nigga You Thought I Was Lyrics
This yo' hood K, bitch, so call me CK hero
In a 187 on Crip, and one hundred percent but Damus zero
Be called everything from Rickets to Crab, 'cause I put the stomp down
Slob niggas ain't know I'm a gangsta baby, baby gangsta Compton
Tape? for homie, that we gives a fuck about which is blue or cripple
No Glock to the temple, ? that's over and kiccin' it simple
I know one dizzay, I'm bound to catch a fuckin' kizzay
Can't get awizzay, I shot a slob in the fizzay
So if you happen to see my bitch and my shit, you jaccer
She come to me, I get the 47 and boom-shakalaka!
Slobs heatin' up, set 'em on fire, put the fire on 'em
That's why he did it, 'cause what, cuz? That nigga's a brim
Couldn't see my face, all the witness say that bitch is callin' me young cuz
Got away scot-free, and a G, on two C's

(AWOL) I'm not the nigga you thought I was
(Crip Face) What's your name, boy?
(AWOL) A-W-O-L
(Big Mike x2) Lettin' a nigga think he know me, but he really don't know me, G
(Crip Face) And where you from, fool?
(AWOL) I'm not the nigga you thought I was
Nigga from Kelly Park Compton, cuz
Doin' this shit like Oklahoma, niggas would not know what it was

Damn, here come the K-side, niggas don't want no problems
Niggas ain't never heard of a .45 revolver
"Niggas don't want no muthafuccin' problems with my hood"
Baby gangsta evil side K's up, it's understood
Hun Loc, should I fuck this Slob bitch? (Hell nah!) No, I shouldn't
'Cause I said a Slob bitch make me itch
And if I'm fuccing her, she fucc a nigga, that means I'm fuccin' 'em both
And if I fucc without a rubber then I'm fuccin' too close
Call me a playa hata, bitch, as long as I love the gangstas
One of you playas are bustas, why the fucc can't I hate you?
Play a dicc on down your throat, see you gangsta haters hiccup
Glock .50 piccup, now bitch, checc this sticcup
I guess I jack yo' mama first, catch her slippin' comin' from church
Do ? work, snatch her purse, empty my clips 'til they die from thirst
Just to woop her ass, make her lick my nuts
Until her ? ?will be fucked?
Don't snitch you bitch, just tell 'em
...It's not the nigga you thought it was

(AWOL) I'm not the nigga you thought I was
(Crip Face) What's your name, boy?
(AWOL) A-W-O-L
(Big Mike x2) Lettin' a nigga think he know me, but he really don't know me, G
(Crip Face) And where you from, fool?
(AWOL) I'm not the nigga you thought I was
Nigga from Kelly Park Compton, cuz
Doin' this shit like Oklahoma, niggas would not know what it was
Now when the times get behind me with this Slob in my trunk
I'm dippin', hardcore, in the street I'm rippin', 25 with the L, are you trippin'? (Off what?)
Off my gang signs, this young B.G. ain't colorblind
Learnt HOW to split that gang of purple in half, since ?I was 9?
As you could tell a nigga's stucc to the truest side
My niggas picc me up, the other side was suicide
Slob nigga don't underestimate the plan
Why you thinkin' this shit is cool, I'm trying to conjure up some contraband
A gun, a knife, a fork, a spoon
Sharpen anything, lettin' the gangsta hater meet his doom
A-W-O-L, I'm wild off the loot
Not the nigga you thought I was, nigga that killed that nigga for his coupe
I loot, when it ain't no riot going on
Weigh far less than 200 pounds, so bitch, I ain't that strong
Who needs to be stronger as my index finger could pull
Say I'll leave your mouth full, I'm not the nigga you thought I was
 x4
(AWOL) I'm not the nigga you thought I was
(Crip Face) What's your name, boy?
(AWOL) A-W-O-L
(Big Mike x2) Lettin' a nigga think he know me, but he really don't know me, G
(Crip Face) And where you from, fool?
(AWOL) I'm not the nigga you thought I was
Nigga from Kelly Park Compton, cuz
Doin' this shit like Oklahoma, niggas would not know what it was
"Lettin' a nigga think he know me, but he really don't know me, G" (Big Mike)Embed
