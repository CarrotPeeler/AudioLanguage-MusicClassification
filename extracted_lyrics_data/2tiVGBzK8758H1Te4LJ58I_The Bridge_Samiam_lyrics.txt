1 ContributorThe Bridge LyricsThere's this bridge I've got to cross I feel alone
A child down to each side and I can't carry both
The bridge is long we could fall down through holes
Water all around; wind, wet and cold
One child insecure displays the confidence he doesn't own
Another child, uncertain, looks around and cries for home
My bridge is too unstable and the insecurity is letting go
There's no holding to a crumbling bridge
When all the time is gone in between it tumbles
Time to move along...
I toss and turn over and over
Trying to dream out anxiety
Easy answers to my problems
Keeping a grip on sanity
Until the sun comes up
And my mind's fresh and cleanYou might also likeEmbed
