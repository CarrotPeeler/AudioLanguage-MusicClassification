10 ContributorsGuitar Lyrics
(Oh Yeah)
Yeah
Uh uh

Getting dirty at the club again
I'm usually 'round your waist like a chain but then
I got that call
So I jumped in my car

I love you, baby
But not like I love my guitar
Uh huh
Not like I love my guitar
No

You couldn't do it all by yourself
You had to go and get somebody else
You're high enough to call me
But you can't reach the bar

I love you, baby
But not like I love my guitar
No
Not like I love my guitar
You might also like
Oh, listen, turn it up
Uh uh, yeah, now dig


I tried to warn you that it's hard to be a star
Especially when you're driving other people's car
I would have gave you mine, girl
But you took it too far

I love you, baby, huh
But just not like I love my guitar - whoo, uh uh
Not like I love my guitar
Oh

I know you love me and you want to be friends
And if you don't, at least you need to pretend
We're still together
Even if we don't get that far

I love you, baby
But not like I love this guitar
I love you, baby, I love you, baby
Not like I love my guitar
I love you, baby, and I wish you well (I wish you well)
I'll write a letter when I learn how to spell
Until that day, you can go to... 
I love you, baby.... you know the rest

Aah aah aahEmbed
