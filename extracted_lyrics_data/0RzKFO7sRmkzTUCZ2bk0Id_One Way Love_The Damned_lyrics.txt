3 ContributorsOne Way Love Lyrics
She don't care about your miseries
There ain't nothing you can do
She's just preying on your injuries
Just makes you look a fool

I guess you better fall for another girl
Before you fall from above
I guess you better find yourself another girl
'Cause all you got is a one way
A one way, a one way, a one way, one way love
One way, a one way, a one way, one way love
One way, a one way, a one way, one way love
One way, a one way, a one way, one way love

She ain't the cutie that you used to know
She's the fastest girl in town
She ain't worried who's been shooting her
But that's sure to come around

I guess you better fall for another girl
Before you fall from above
I guess you better find yourself another girl
'Cause all you got is a one way
A one way, a one way, a one way, one way love
One way, a one way, a one way, one way love
One way, a one way, a one way, one way love
One way, a one way, a one way, one way love

She don't care about your miseries
There ain't nothing you can do
She's just preying on your injuries
She just makes you look a fool

I guess you better fall for another girl
Before you fall from above
I guess you better find yourself another girl
'Cause all you got is a one way
A one way, a one way, a one way, one way love
One way, a one way, a one way, one way love
One way, a one way, a one way, one way love
One way, a one way, a one way, one way love

Hey you, take a trip from me
You gotta take a one way love
Hey you, take a trip from me
You gotta take a one way love
Hey you, take a trip from me
You gotta take a one way love
Hey you, take a trip from me
You gotta take a one way loveEmbed
