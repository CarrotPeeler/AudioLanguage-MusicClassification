10 ContributorsFrolic Room Lyrics
Yeah
There's a gravity in me pulling me to want to see
What is going on tonight beneath the electric starlight
I like to mix with walks of life who live life on the other side
Pulling muscles from their shell, a place to some that looks like hell
Oh, the classic song that the jukebox is on has me movin'
Oh, the faces here make it so surreal

Oh, in the company of pretty girls and near vagrants
One drink away from sleeping on the pavement
I'm not quite sure what I find so appealing
About the happy hour stealing

A party after party, 'til it started to get grating
Another and another, what are we celebrating?
There's always something not to miss, diving back in the abyss
And it gets so very stale, but tomorrow's a new tale
In the Frolic Room, woah
The seat I assume, yeah
And I'm drawn to the night
And its damn neon light, yeah

Where are we meeting up at? Let me guess, bet I know
Does it have a sign in the window, ice cold six packs to go?
Sleep it off if you have to, there's a booth always in shadow
The reality is all around you, it's the best reality show
You might also like
In the company of the privileged and the nearly damned
Mixing like a cocktail of pure spirits slammed
In the danger zone is where you'll find me
In a certain dive so inviting

A party after party, 'til it started to get grating
Another and another, what are we celebrating?
There's always something not to miss, diving back in the abyss
And it gets so very stale, but tomorrow's a new tale
In the Frolic Room, woah
The seat I assume, yeah
And I'm drawn to the night
And its damn neon light, yeah3Embed
