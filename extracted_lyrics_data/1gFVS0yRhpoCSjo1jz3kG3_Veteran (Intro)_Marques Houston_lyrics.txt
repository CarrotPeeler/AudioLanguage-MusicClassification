6 ContributorsVeteran (Intro) LyricsMy name is Marques...Barrett...Houston
My mommy's name is Carrolyn and my daddy's name is Michael
And my brother's name is Brandon and my sister is Danyelle
I like Michael Jackson and Eddie Murphy
And sometimes my grandmother Bebe comes over and she going to put me in a movie and we going to be rich
Even when I was 2 I knew I'd be something. I thank God because without him none of this would be
When I was 8 I was on my "Worst Behavior."
By the time I was 12 "Playtime Was Over."
When I was 14 I told the world "We Got It."
And at 16 I took you on my "Journey."
At 18 I introduced you to "IMX."
And at 20 IMX came to an end
But then again every end has a new beginning
At 21 that beginning gave birth to "MH."
At 23 MH got "Naked."
After millions of albums sold, hundreds of magazine covers, 3 years in a row making ya'll "Scream", 7 seasons of television, and the number 1 movie that made the whole world wanna dance
From the beginning to now, I survived the rumors, the negativity, the drama, the break ups, the make ups, the confusion between me and people about me saying shit on the radio I never said
I inspired the new generation of music
So, now at 25 I think it is safe to say: That I Marques Houston am a "Veteran"You might also likeEmbed
