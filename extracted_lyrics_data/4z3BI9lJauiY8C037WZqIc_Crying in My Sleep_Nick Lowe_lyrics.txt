1 ContributorCrying in My Sleep LyricsLast night I saw you on the street
With a beefy hanger on
Slow walking upon your beat
You were made up girl
Choked up by rage and grief
I stole up to you and I drew my steel
One flash brought fast relief
Then I woke up I was crying in my sleep
Crying in my sleep
There are tears on my pillow
Last night I had you on the sand
In the shimmer of a desert glare
Lord knows how you got there
You were dried out girl
I pull a flagon on my hand
For precious water is what you crave now
I tip it into the sand to seep
Then I woke up and I was crying in my sleep
Crying in my sleep
There are tears on my pillow
Crying in my sleep
There are tears on my pillow
You might also likeLast night on a windy ledge
I saw you standing with your hair streaming down
Strollin' up while you made your pledge
I was too tired girl
I came upon it when the blue lights played
On the faces of them looking on
Someone shouted "jump" I said "leap"
Then I woke up and I was crying in my sleep
Crying in my sleep, crying in my sleep
There are tears on my pillow
Crying in my sleep
There are tears on my pillowEmbed
