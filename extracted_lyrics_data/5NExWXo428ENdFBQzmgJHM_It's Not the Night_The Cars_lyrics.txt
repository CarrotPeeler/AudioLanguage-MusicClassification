It's not the night for fooling
It's not the night for crazy eyes
I get the feeling you want to stay
I get the feeling you're giving it all away
But I know, I know you take it well
And for you, for you I always fell

It's not the night for sweet revenge
It's not the night to spend

The time is right to take it out
The time is right for tango
I get the feeling you're running out
Before your last fandango

It's not the night for sweet, sweet revenge
It's not the night to spend

I get the feeling you're the spark
That's dancing in the dark
I get the feeling you're the one
Rushing on the run
You might also like
It's not the night for sweet, sweet revenge
It's not the night to spendEmbed
