16 ContributorsScared of Lonely Lyrics
I'm in this fight and I'm swingin', and my arms are gettin' tired
I'm tryna beat this emptiness, but I'm runnin' out of time
I'm sinkin' in the sand and I can barely stand
I'm lost in this dream, I need you to hold me
I'm scared of lonely
I try to be patient, but I'm hurtin' deep inside
And I can't keep waitin', I need comfort late at night
And I can't find my way, won't you lead me home?
'Cause I'm lost in this dream, I need you to hold me
I'm scared of lonely

And I'm scared of bein' the only
Shadow I see along the wall (Of lonely)
And I'm scared the only heartbeat
I hear beatin' is my own (Of lonely)
And I'm scared of being alone
I can't seem to breathe when I am lost in this dream
I need you to hold me
I'm scared of lonely
I'm scared of lonely

I cry at night, 'cause my baby's too far to be by my side
To wipe away these tears of mine, so I hold my pillow tight
To imagine you outstretch your hand, lookin' for mine
'Cause I'm lost in this dream, I need you to hold me
I'm scared of lonely
You might also like
And I'm scared of bein' the only
Shadow I see along the wall (I'm scared of lonely, of lonely)
And I'm scared the only heartbeat
I hear beatin' is my own (I'm scared of lonely, of lonely)
And I'm scared of being alone
I can't seem to breathe when I am lost
'Cause I am lost in this dream, I need you to hold me

I need your strength when nobody is around
'Cause I'm tired of this emptiness, I think I'm drownin'
I can't be lonely no more
And I'm lost in this dream, I need you to hold me
I'm scared of lonely

And I'm scared of bein' the only
Shadow I see along the wall (Of lonely)
And I'm scared the only heartbeat
I hear beatin' is my own (Of lonely)
And I'm scared of being alone
I can't seem to breathe when I am lost in this dream
I need you to hold me
I'm scared of lonely
And I'm scared of being the only
Shadow I see along the wall (Of lonely)
And I'm scared the only heartbeat
I hear beatin' is my own (Of lonely)
And I'm scared of being alone
I can't seem to breathe when I am lost in this dream
I need you to hold me
I'm scared of lonely
