1 ContributorHeart of a rat Lyrics"Heart Of A Rat"
Yeah!
Oh-Oh-Oh, I'm gonna make it
I want silk robes in my closet too
I want trophies to remind me
Of those times when I sold you out
The heart of a rat
The heart of a rat
The heart of a rat
The heart of a rat
The heart of a rat
The heart of a rat
The heart of a rat is a lonely one
Oh-Oh-Oh, You have spoken
You fucked up, sell it by the ounce
Keep us warm, keep us sedated
Stick the blade, now please pull it out
The heart of a rat
The heart of a rat
The heart of a rat
The heart of a rat
The heart of a rat
The heart of a rat
The heart of a rat is a lonely one
You might also likeThe heart of a rat
The heart of a rat
The heart of a rat
The heart of a rat is a lonely one
Oh-Oh-Oh, Bring on the cannons
March right through, bring on the cavalry
The heart of a rat
The heart of a rat
The heart of a rat
The heart of a rat
The heart of a rat
The heart of a rat
The heart of a rat is a lonely one
The heart of a rat
The heart of a rat
The heart of a rat
The heart of a rat is a lonely one
The heart of a rat
The heart of a rat
The heart of a rat
I-is a lonely oneEmbed
