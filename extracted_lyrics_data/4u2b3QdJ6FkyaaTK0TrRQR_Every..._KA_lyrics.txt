8 ContributorsEvery... Lyrics
Every day, every week, every month
All you did was need a dream for what you want
Sometimes you had to bleed, as long as you ain't front
Been breed to hunt, been drilling since weeds and runts
Sling or starve, swing it hard never bunt
Pumping with a pump and a bag, know the ave, better jump
Every day, every week, every month

From Hull Street
Off Hopkinson and Saratoga man
First plan was pack bags, return soda cans
Never rested, cause you don't get tested, they hold exams
What is Ocean Hill? you know the deal, no one ran
Every day is drama--I'm a devoted fan
No love or trust, a royal flush? never show your hand
Or have a full house of evil tense goons
Straight poking on your necks with Eagles, inf's, Rug's
My shit is dope without needles, bent spoons
Came to house the game, y'all free to rent rooms
I drop jewels like I popped a link
When I moved off instinct I ain't stop to think
Didn't spill a drop but had the stove propped by the sink
Intoxicated with tryna make it, I ain't gotta drink
You might also like

I was on it all
Welfare, WIC, and soup lines
Free lunch every day, in the summer two times
If life's one big road, I need new signs
Used to save pennies and nickels, to run through dimes
Whoever say it don't pay must don't do crimes
Got lots of pre-owned shit when I used 9's
Cause fuck that green neck shit, I need true shines
I don't roll deep cause most of my peeps in a hole, 'sleep
I invade Rumors, see me g old freaks
I'm suede Puma, BVD, gold teeth
A late bloomer, previously sold heat
It's more than just nice rhyme
I'm a product of hard, so a lot of these bars took a lifetime
Gambled with Death, before I left, said "Them dice mine."
Every measure flooded with treasures you might find
From amazing days, and nights exciting
Where you get played for playing and learn to fight by fighting
