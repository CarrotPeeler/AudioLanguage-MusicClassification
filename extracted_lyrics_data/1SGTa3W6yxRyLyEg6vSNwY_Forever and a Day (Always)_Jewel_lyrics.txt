2 ContributorsForever and a Day (Always) Lyrics
The other day you asked me to
Tell you how much I love you
Oh, but words so often fail
To describe the depth and scale
And even though it may sound cliché
I'll tell you now in my simple way

My love is as true as the oceans are blue
And I always feel this way
Just listen to the beating that keeps repeating
My heart wants to say
Like Gala and Dalí, it's you and me
Forever and a day
Forever and a day
Always

You watch me turn out the light
Wrap my arms around you, say goodnight
Trace our shadows on the wall
Thank God for the miracle of it all

My love is true as the oceans are blue
And I always feel this way
Just listen to the beating that keeps repeating
My heart wants to say
Like Gala and Dalí, it's you and me
Forever and a day
Forever and a day
Always
You might also like
The road of life winds
With the passing of time
I can hear you say
How can hearts know
Where love will go
Beyond today?

Just listen to the beating that keeps repeating
My heart wants to say
Like Gala and Dalí, it's you and me
Forever and a day
Forever and a day
AlwaysEmbed
