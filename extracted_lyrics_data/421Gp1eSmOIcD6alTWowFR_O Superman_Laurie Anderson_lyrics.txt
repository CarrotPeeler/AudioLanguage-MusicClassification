1 ContributorO Superman (Laurie Anderson Cover) LyricsYou don't know but I know you
And I've got a message for you
I am the hand, the hand that takes
Here come the planes come the planes
'Cause when love is gone, there's always justice
And when justice is gone, there's always force
And when force is gone, there's always Mom
O Superman
O Judge
O Mom and Dad
O Superman
O Judge
O Mom and Dad
Hold me in your long arms
In your automatic arms, your electronic arms
In your  arms, in your  arms
In your arms, in your arms
In your arms, in your arms
Here come the planes come the planes
You can come as you are, but pay as you go, pay as you go
O Superman
O Judge
O Mom and Dad
