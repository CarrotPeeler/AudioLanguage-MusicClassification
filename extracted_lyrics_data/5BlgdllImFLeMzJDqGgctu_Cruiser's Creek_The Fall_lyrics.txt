What really went on there?
We only have this excerpt:

There's a party going on down around here
Cruiser's Creek yeah
Watch the shirt-tails flapping in the wind
Sidewalk running
See the people holding from the back
Hat-boaters tilting
There's a party going down around here
Cruiser's Creek now

Uh Cruiser's Creek yeah
At Cruiser's Creek ah
At Cruiser's Creek now

Got nice pink bubbles in my mouth
From what I've taken
There's a party come around annual
Cruiser's Creek now
And Bianco on the breath guaranteed
Cruiser's Creek yeah
At Cruiser's Creek now
At Cruiser's Creek
You might also like
At Cruiser's Creek yeah
At Cruiser's Creek now (Cruiser's, Creeker, Creeker's, Cruiser)
At Cruiser's Creek yeah (Cruiser's, Creeker, Creeker's, Cruiser)

See the street-litter twisting in the wind
Crisp bags turning
See B&H cartons laughing in the wind
Road-litter turning
Spent forty-five minutes last night
On parallel crease, pow!
And there's a good mid-afternoon breeze
In the air now
With quick treats from clerk Pete
My brain is clear now
No more red lead chimney puff
Or ZTT stuff
At Cruiser's Creek now
At Cruiser's Creek yeah
At Cruiser's Creek

At Cruiser's Creek-ah
At Cruiser's Creek, yeah (Cruiser's, Creeker, Creeker's, Cruiser)
At Cruiser's Creek now (Cruiser's, Creeker, Creeker's, Cruiser)
There's a party going down around here
Next to Freider's Freighter
Get the lead ore deposit off my chest
At Cruiser's Creek yeah
Quick sex behind steel cabinets
Is for what I'm yearning
And there's a dim chance it's what I'm gonna get
At Cruiser's Creek yeah
At Cruiser's Creek now
At Cruiser's Creek

Cruiser's creek yeah (Workforce! Limited!)
Cruiser's Creek now (Happy, happy, Cruiser's, Creeker)
Cruiser's Creek yeah (Happy, chasing, Freider's, Freighter)

Somebody went and left on the gas
Checkpoint, main gate
As I lit a number 6 cigarette
Like a wick, burning
At Cruiser's Creeker
Stamp it out just before it's too late
And turn the tap off
My name is Big Hero Mate
At Cruiser's Creeker
Avert disaster
And I imagine (Happy, happy, Cruiser's, Creeker)
The sound of its blast, yeah (Happy, chasing, Freider's, Freighter)

Ahhhhh
There's a party going down around here
At Cruiser's Creek now
Watch the shirt-tails flapping in the wind
Sidewalk running
See the people holding from the back
Hat-boaters tilting
There's a party going on around here
At Cruiser's Creek now
At Cruiser's Creek yeah
At Cruiser's Creek

Nuptial!
Annual! (Cruiser's, Creeker, Creeker's, Cruiser)
Freaks limited! (Cruiser's, Creeker, Creeker's, Cruiser)
Cruiser's Creek!Embed
