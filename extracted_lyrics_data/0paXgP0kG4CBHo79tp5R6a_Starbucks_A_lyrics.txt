Don't want to quit, but that's a pretty nice door there
I got a bed, it really cost a fortune
I go away and it's too big without you
We got it good, you know how good we got it
We got it bad, you know how bad we got it
I wouldn't swap it for a job in Starbucks
Come on, and you can have your own way
Come on, and you can have your own say
So long, you'll miss it when it's gone
You don't know what it is, you don't know what it is, yeah
He works on automatic
Mr. Clean, but I doubt it
He's got to have his say
Who needs him anyway?
Don't get your kind of music
He lets the others choose it
He thinks you kids are freaks
He wants you off the streets
Come on, and you can have your own way
Come on, and you can have your own say
So long, you'll miss it when it's gone
You don't know what it is, you don't know what it is

You don't know what it means to me
Take it as far as it goes
And I don't want no one to know
It's too late to talk about it
And I ain't changing any of it
Don't listen to us
Don't want your job in Starbucks
Come on, and you can have your own way
Come on, and you can have your own say
So long, you'll miss it when it's gone
You don't know what it is, you don't know what it isEmbed
