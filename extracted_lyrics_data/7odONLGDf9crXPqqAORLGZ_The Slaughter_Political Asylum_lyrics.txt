2 ContributorsKings of the Asylum LyricsYou make the rich richer as you steal from the poor
Political scripture triggers another war
Spread misinformation and betray public trust
Callous exploitation grotesque and unjust
You're on the make yeah you're always on the take
Secret love affairs corrupt billionaires
Vulgar success and the power the money the sex
You hold the keys to the asylum
You shout because you don't know how to be silent
You are the kings of, kings of the asylum
You are thе kings of, kings of the asylum
You send men to thе slaughter as you tighten the noose
Secret new world order just a monkey in a suit
You're the clown the court jester the but of the joke
You let the lies fester and fear you evoke
You're on the make yeah you're always on the take
Secret love affairs corrupt billionaires
Vulgar success and the power the money the sex
You hold the keys to the asylum
You shout because you don't know how to be silent
You are the kings of, kings of the asylum
You are the kings of, kings of the asylum
You might also likeThere's blood in the water you'd better be quick
Like lambs to the slaughter playing your dirty tricks
There's blood in the water they're closing in
Sacrifice at the alter for living in sin
You're on the make yeah you're always on the take
Secret love affairs corrupt billionaires
Vulgar success and the power the money the sex
You hold the keys to the asylum
You shout because you don't know how to be silent
You are the kings of, kings of the asylum
You are the kings of, kings of the asylum
(Hail the king)
