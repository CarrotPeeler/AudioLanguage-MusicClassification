4 ContributorsWanna Be Your Lover Lyrics
Ooh baby, I'm feenin' for you, girl, I got it bad
You turn me on when you walk like that
For Heaven's sake
Your body is perfect in every place
Think God broke the mold when he made
The most beautiful girl that I have ever faced
I wanna give you lovin' all day
Then give it to you all night

When you call, just say, "J, I'm burnin' for lovin'"
I'll heat it up just like a oven
I won't stop (Stop, stop) 'til you're screamin' out
That I'm all that you need

'Cause I wanna be your, wanna be your
Wanna be your lover
And I wanna be your, wanna be your
Wanna be your lover
I, I wanna be your lover
I, I wanna be your lover

Now, when it comes to love, I'm qualified
Experienced, I'll be your guide
I aim to please, that's what I do
I make it happen all night
Take a trip, if you like
Have the time of your life
I'm tryin' to show you, pretty thing
With me you're gonna find ecstasy, baby
If you get with me, baby

When you you call just say, "J, I'm burnin' for lovin'"
I'll heat it it up just like an oven
I won't stop (Stop, stop) 'til you're screamin' out
That I'm all that you need
Oh, whoa, I

'Cause I wanna be your, wanna be your
Wanna be your lover
Ah baby, I wanna be your, wanna be your
Wanna be your lover
I wanna be your, wanna be your
Wanna be your lover
Baby, I wanna be your lover, ooh-hoo

Ooh (Ooh-hoo), ah yeah
Do you feel it, baby?
Said it feels like walking on the beach
Ooh, white sand, oh, feels so good (Yeah, baby)
Oh baby, oh baby, oh baby, let's get together
Do this thing like we're Oprah and Stedman
We could be lovers or the best of friends like Goldie and Kurt Russell

So baby, I wanna be your, wanna be your
Wanna be your lover
I wanna be your, wanna be your
Wanna be your lover
Oh, I, I wanna be your, wanna be your
Wanna be your lover
Now, I...Embed
