40 Contributors4 Page Letter Lyrics
Yo, turn my music up
Up some more, up some more
Up a little bit more

Mama always told me to be careful who I love
And daddy always told me make sure he's right
I always had my eyes on this one particular guy
I was too shy, so I decided to write

I'm sending him a four page letter
And I enclosed it with a kiss
And when I write him, he better get it on time
I'm sending him a four page letter
And I enclosed it with a kiss
And when I write him, he better get it on time

People always say that I've played myself for you
They say that you don't even notice me (Me, me, me, me, me, me)
Maybe when I get the nerve to come to you
Promise me that you won't diss me

I'm sending him a four page letter
And I enclosed it with a kiss
And when I write him, he better get it on time
I'm sending him a four page letter
And I enclosed it with a kiss
And when I write him, he better get it on time
You might also like
I'm writing you a love letter tonight
You better keep watch
'Cause the mailman's coming
I'm writing you a love letter tonight
You better keep watch
'Cause the mailman's coming

I'm sending him a four page letter
And I enclosed it with a kiss
And when I write him, he better get it on time
I'm sending him a four page letter
And I enclosed it with a kiss
And when I write him, he better get it on time
(When I write him, he better get it on time)18Embed
