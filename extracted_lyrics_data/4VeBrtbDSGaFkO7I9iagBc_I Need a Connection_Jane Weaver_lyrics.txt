3 ContributorsI Need A Connection LyricsWill you? Won't you? Just forget it
Time will tell you what's worth waiting for
Or...
In your head it's complicated
You will see it's not worth breaking falls
Falls
Oh, I'm standing on the edge of view
I need a connection
I'm standing on the edge of view
I need a connection
You feel that you won't regret it
When it's all bad timing, so let go
Oh
Then you'll see it's so amazing
Different set of rules, time to let go
Oh
Oh, I'm standing on the edge of view
I need a connection
Aware of something, never knew
I need a connection
I'm standing at the edge of view
I need a connection
I need a connection
I need a connection
I need a connection

I want to protect you, I want to impress you
I want to suggest how I'm sending the message
I want to protect you, I want to impress you
I want to suggest how I'm sending the message
I want to protect you, I want to impress you
I want to suggest to, I want to impress you
I want to infect you, I want to inject you
I want to suggest how I'm sending the message
I'm standing at the edge of view
