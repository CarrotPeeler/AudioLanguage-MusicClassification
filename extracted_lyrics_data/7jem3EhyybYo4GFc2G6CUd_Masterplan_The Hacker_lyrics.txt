1 ContributorMasterplan (feat. miss kittin) LyricsTake off in a box with wings
Landing falling into tears
Frequent trouble or sickness, at it's best
Rock girls, should have killed them selves
You're scared of planes?
We won't hold your hands
No plan is the ultimate master-plan
But here we go again
Taxi driver talking like a machine
And you sit right next to me, dreaming
Safe way back home in Berlin, Minsk
When all the traffic lights are green
Show us pictures of your kids
Show us how it could have been
We may be deaf but we are not blind
We never lie we only change your minds
We don't care about you
Music louder please, thanks
Don't tell us what is normal
We fit in nothing of your kind
Try to repeat and you'll be bleeding inside
We don't care about you, and your wealth around
We don't care about you, and your wealth around
We don't care about you, and your wealth around
Call it darkness if you want
We will always stay under the ground
And when we will lay down from dusk till dawn
We know, we know, we'll be already gone
We know, we know... gone
We are from the blank generation
Too proud for drug addiction
Too old to reprogram, freak out or rehab
We are from the 10th generation
We love dysfunction
Die old, and live fast
The night is young, cause we are the nightYou might also likeEmbed
