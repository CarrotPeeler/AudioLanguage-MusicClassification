2 ContributorsFear the Fear LyricsBravery
As we've all seen on TV
Explosions and swords
Hot girls in reward
And in the games you play
You are the hero of the day
But outside that land
Your head's in the sand
And you think you are bold, and you think you are brave
When push comes to shove, you know it's a feign
You're better off if you choose to abstain
Your fear is your true grave
You turn your head
From all the things you dread
It will keep you alive
At least for a while
And all your sympathy
Is like flowers and tea
Sent by the man
Who betrayed your clan
You have covered your eyes, you have covered your ears
So easy to hide from confronting your fears
Sooner or later it will all end in tears
The cry that no one hears
You might also likeGood morning world, this is your wake-up call
—It's not your war, you say, while you turn your head away
A thousand deaths for you to die before you fall
—Mayday, Mayday, S.M.S. —Save My Soul, forget the rest
Good morning world, this is your wake-up call
—Those who stand for nothing at all, for anything are bound to fall
A thousand deaths for you to die before you fall
—Your lame excuses you can spare, they only live who dare!
Coins you toss
Weighted by your fear of loss
Both sides are heads
The tail's between your legs
And just as well as I
You know what you should do and why
But just falter on
And hope it be gone
And you think you are bold, and you think you are brave
When push comes to shove, you know it's a feign
You're better off if you choose to abstain
Your fear is your true grave
Good morning world, this is your wake-up call
—It's not your war you say, while you turn your head away
A thousand deaths for you to die before you fall
—Mayday, Mayday, S.M.S. —Save My Soul, forget the rest
Good morning world, this is your wake-up call
—Those who stand for nothing at all, for anything are bound to fall
A thousand deaths for you to die before you fall
—Your lame excuses you can spare, they only live who dare!
Die! Die, you sucker, die!
Let me go! Let me free, motherfucker!
Die! Die, you sucker, die!
Let the coward die!
Time stands still
For you to write your will
What's left behind
No way to rewind1Embed
