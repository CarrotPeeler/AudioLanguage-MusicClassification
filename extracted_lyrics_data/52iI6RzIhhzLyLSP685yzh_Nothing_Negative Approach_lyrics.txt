5 ContributorsNothing LyricsYou try to make things work and gain something
It's all no use, it's all worth nothing
Complete satisfaction, too impossible to believe
Nothing's ever fucking gonna work for me
Tomorrow seems so hopeless
Can't keep it off my mind
Another day of nothing
I'm running out of time
I've got nothing I can look forward to
I'm always left with nothing
I'm always told things I don't want to hear
My destiny's become quite clear
Life's never fucking given nothing to me
It's just stood by and watched me bleed
Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothingYou might also like1Embed
