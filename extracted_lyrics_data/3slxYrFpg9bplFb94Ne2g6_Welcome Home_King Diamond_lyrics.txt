Grandma, welcome home
You have been gone for far too long
Oh, is this a dream, are you really back?

Let me help you out of the chair, G-G-Grandma
Let me touch you, let me feel, ahhh

Grandma, take a look
What do you think of the house and the silvery moon?
We are going to repaint the front door soon

Let me help you out of the chair, G-G-Grandma
Let me touch you, let me feel, ahhh


Wait till you see your room up in the attic
Prepared just like you said, without a bed
You will find your rocking chair and the teapot that Missy found

Let me help you out of the chair, G-G-Grandma
There is someone waiting for you, now come along

Missy and Mother, they are dying to meet you
How strange, she's spoken no word
I wonder Grandma, are you all right?


Grandma, what was it like to be on that holiday site?
"Oh, it could have been worse but with 'Them' by my side
In the twilight 'They' sang all the old lullabies."
Grandma, who are "They"?
"Never mind you dirty little brat, oh."

"Let us go inside, something's on 'Their' mind
'They' are still alive, can you feel 'Their' eyes
Can you feel 'Their' eyes?
Now that you are stuck with me, you'd better be my friend."Embed
