2 ContributorsWhat I Need Is Love Lyrics
You don't understand
Oh what you're doing to me
You're breaking my heart baby
You got me in misery

What I need is love love
Just a little bit of loving to ease my mind

You do all your flirting
With every girl in town
You don't care about me
You don't want me around

What I need is love love love love
Just a little bit of loving to ease my mind

From the very beginning
I thought of changing you
But I failed in every way
But that's alright, that's alright baby
You're gonna need me
You're gonna need me one of these days
So go on your way
And I'll go mine
You're gonna need me baby
Till the end of time
But that's alright
That's alright baby
There's got to be somebody to give me love
Woah woah
You might also like
There's got to be somebody to give me love
Yeah yeah yeah
There's got to be somebody to give me love
I don't need you babyEmbed
