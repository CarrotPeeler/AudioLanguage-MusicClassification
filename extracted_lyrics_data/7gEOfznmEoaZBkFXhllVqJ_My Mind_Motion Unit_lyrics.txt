1 ContributorOmniscient Lyrics
I'm back writing some sad tracks, aye
I'm here floating through the motions
My mind untold, aye
But I'm feeling down in the dirt
Because that is all I've ever known
Always feeling bent and hurt
It is always the worst
Never had anyone there for me
To bring me out the dark times
Wishing I was Omniscient
To bring me back
Out of insanity
To find solace in the chaos

Constant feeling of being alone
No one to hold me, through the tears
It is a constant struggle, to even find my voice
It never really was a choice
To deal with all of the shit I deal with on the day to day, aye
Fear of dying alone, no one loving me
I send prayers up to Heaven, never feel like they're answered
So I sit, wanting to cry
Tears never fall, face always dry
But I always seem to fall in July
Still here suffering on the day
Struggling to write the words I wanna say
Want to vent that emotion, but no one gives a damn
Grew up keeping it in and to myself, aye
You might also like
I'm back writing some sad tracks, aye
I'm here floating through the motions
My mind untold, aye
But I'm feeling down in the dirt
Because that is all I've ever known
Always feeling bent and hurt
It is always the worst
Never had anyone there for me
To bring me out the dark times
Wishing I was Omniscient
To bring me back
Out of insanity
To find solace in the chaos

I lay in bed, staring at a plain ceiling
I constantly wonder, If I'm going to die alone
Scars on my chest, and neck
From something I don't want to forget
But she already has, on the sunset
Wanting to come alive at night
But it always is, such a fright
To be with my thoughts always causes such a bite
Whether to be polite or need to expedite
Or maybe I, need to depress
All these thoughts in my head
Always have to see it as progress
But it always is overhead
Darkness always is misread
I come out fine but questioning everything
In my path
Truth is, can I be saved once againEmbed
