There'll be a day when we stare ahead
There'll be a day we we share a hand -
Why do we hide our feelings inside
Hide our feelings inside
There'll be a day with less of bothering
The less we tire, the more we're wondering
Why do we hide ourselves in a shelter
Hide ourselves in a shelter

So alone now
And you feel so alone now

Only run - you don't stop
All you need - you don't drop
In the herd you feel so alone now
In the day you were quiet
On the road you feel tired
Take a breath
Don't be so alone now

We read our histories
Open up a book
We had something to miss
You might also like
We living in the bliss
Come here closer child
And i give you the keys
You don't be so alone nowEmbed
