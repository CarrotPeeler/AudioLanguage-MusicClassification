5 ContributorsThe Valley Lyrics
When it began
Lacking a goal
Ten years I ran
In hunt for a soul
Adhesive flame
Endless it seems
Intriguing shame
Too late to redeem
Everyone knows
Honest and brave
What lies too close
Something to save
 
Valley
Valley in sin
Valley
This valley I'm in
Where you are?
My secret star

Moving away
Nowhere to run
No one can stay
Vanishing sun
See Leprous LiveGet tickets as low as $43You might also like
Visibly frail
Easy to see
How to prevail
Still there it lies
In rivers thin
Down in disguise
In my valley within
 
Valley
Valley in sin
Valley
This valley I'm in
Where you are?
My secret starEmbed
