Some people watch, some people pray
But even lights can fade away
Some people hope, some people pay
But why we have to stay

'Cause even heroes get the blues
Or any misery you choose
You like to watch, we like to use
And we were born to lose

I choose defeat, I walk away
And leave this place the same today
Some like to sleep, we like to play
Just look at all that pain

You want the heart or to be saved
But even good guys still get paid
So watch my back and keep the blade
I think it got you laid
So fake your death, erase your blame
And leave the lights on when you stay
Take off your clothes and dream that fame
Come on and feel that shame

I choose defeat, I walk away
And leave this place the same today
Some like to sleep, we like to play
Just look at all that pain


Just look at all that pain
Just look at all that pain
Just look at all that pain
Just give me all that pain
Just give me all that pain
Just give me all that pain

I choose defeat, I walk away
And leave this place the same today
Some like to sleep, we like to play
Just look at all that pain25Embed
