1 ContributorWatching The Eyes Of Someone Lying LyricsLips open up and palms explode
Arms reach, grab nothing but ropes
Lips open up and palms explode
Arms reach
Everything hangs in the end
Everything hangs in the end
Everything...
Lips open up and palms explode
Arms reach, grab nothing but ropes
Everything hangs in the end
Stomach unties knots and eyes watch so many games
Good night
Say good night to all that say they are with you
If this is an ending, don't read this until I'm dead
Then smash my headstone
Into thread
Hungry fucked up worms
Smash my headstone into thread
And make a home for hungry fucked up worms
Smash my headstone into thread
And make it a home for hungry fucked up worms
They're beautiful... Beautiful
You might also likeHungry fucked up worms
Smash my headstone into thread
Smash...
Lips open up and palms explode
Arms reach, grab nothing but ropes
Everything hangs in the endEmbed
