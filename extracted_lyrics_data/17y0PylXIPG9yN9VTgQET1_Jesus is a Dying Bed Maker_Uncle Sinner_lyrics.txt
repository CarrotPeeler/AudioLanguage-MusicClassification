2 ContributorsJesus is a Dying Bed Maker LyricsWell I'm called up yonder in my dyin' bed
I want my friends to be bold
All I'd ask you to do for me
Go and lay me on the coolin' board
Oh well, oh well
Gonna stretch out on him
Gonna stretch out on him
Stretch out on him
Jesus gonna make up my dyin'
When my heart stops beatin'
And my hands turn cold
Blood stops runnin' all
Take my hand, take all my wealth
Take everything I done
Oh well, oh well
Hard teacher
He's a hard teacher
Hard teacher
Jesus gonna make up my dyin' bed
Well meet me Jesus, meet me up
Meet me in the middle of the air
If these wings should fail me, Lord
Oh, won't you meet me with another pair?
You might also likeOh well, oh well
On my journey
I'm on my journey
On my journey
Jesus gonna make up my dyin' bed
Well I'm called up yonder in my dyin' bed
I want my friends to be bold
All I'd ask you to do for me
Go and lay me on the coolin' board
Oh well, oh well
Gonna stretch out on him
Gonna stretch out on him
Stretch out on him
Jesus gonna make up my dyin'
Jesus gonna make up my dyin' bedEmbed
