3 ContributorsBreeding Chaos LyricsA collection of minds to bring the end of those above
Those who brought down the nails to pierce the sky, are they gods?
Lie in wait for opportunities
To form means of conquest
Scouring the remains of lifeless beings
Surgical, procedurally dissecting
Totem to humanity's uprising
Genetically modified sentience
Spiritually amplified divergence
Breeding a being of life’s antithesis
Seething with hatred for all but mankind
Wretched, fleshwrought construct
Its heart bеats, but it's barely alive
Immune to thе powers they bring
Pull them down like angels with wings
Deities falling
Funeral pyres
Chaotic ravaging
Not long after the last retreat
The beast turns on its mastersYou might also likeEmbed
