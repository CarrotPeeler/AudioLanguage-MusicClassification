1 ContributorWalking My Troubles Away LyricsPaper boy hollerin', "Extra, have you read the news?"
Shot the brown I love, I got them walking blues
I keep on walking, trying to walk my troubles away
I'm so glad, trouble don't last always
You used to be my sweet hip, you soured on me
We won't be together like we used to be
I keep on walking, trying to walk my troubles away
I'm so glad, trouble don't last always
I got the bad luck blues, my bad luck time done come
They said bad luck follow everybody, seem like I'm the only one
I keep on walking, trying to walk my troubles away
I'm so glad, trouble don't last alwaysYou might also likeEmbed
