2 ContributorsWaterfall LyricsThey wanna see where they don't see
Put my hand in the guillotine
Throw my hand on the grill again
Screaming out as the water stings
Take a punch in another face
Keepin' up in a city race
Feel the weight of another day
In the maze at the seaway
Home, just take me home
Cause when I see the waterfall
Just like a dream when flowers fall
I see the colours as they run
I see the rain-man kiss the sun
Sugar-free is a slip away
Breaking out of the monkey cage
Hear the sirens as they sing
Be the kids of another sin
Something new in a different place
Some one cool may be in his face
Get a life far away from this
Heal the womb with a woman's kiss
Home, just take me home
Cause when I see the waterfall
Just like a dream when flowers fall
I see the colours as they run
I see the rain-man kiss the sun
You might also likeRunning free like the blood in me
In my veins should I count to three
Feel the weight of another day
In the maze at the seaway
Home, just take me home
Cause when I see the waterfall
Just like a dream when flowers fall
I see the colours as they run
I see the rain-man kiss the sun...Embed
