8 ContributorsWasted Lyrics
Singing doo-doo-doodoodoo-doo, doodoo-doo-doo

If you had eyes like golden crowns
And diamonds in your fingertips
You'd waste it
If shining wisdom passed your lips
And traveled to the ears of God
You'd waste it
And so I hate that you're overrated
Most revered and celebrated
Bcause you'll waste it

Then again
It's good to get a call
Now and then
Just to say hello
Have I said
I hate to see you go
I hate to see you go

But every time you close a door
And nothing opens in its place
You've wasted
And when you speak the words you know
To those who know the words themselves
You're wasted
You're such a classic waste of cool
So afraid to break the rules
In all the wrong places
You might also like
But then again
It's good to get a call
Now and then
Just to say hello
Have I said
Oh I hate to see you go
I hate to see you go
But then again
It's good to get a call
Now and then
Just to say hello
Have I said
I hate to see you go
I hate to see you go
