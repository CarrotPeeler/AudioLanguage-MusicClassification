1 ContributorI’m Gonna Love You Lyrics(Robert Ellis Orrall)
Hey baby doll, hey sweet potato
I love you now and I love you later
I'm gonna love you for your whole life through
Hey jelly bean, hey belly button
You ain't gonna have to worry ‘bout nothin'
I'll be there to take good care of you
Hey there honey, you're so funny
You're gonna help me spend my money
We're gonna travel ‘round the whole wide world
Hey sugar bug, you're driving me crazy
I can't believe what God gave me
Everyone's gonna know your my little girl
You brought a change in the weather
Things are just going to keep getting better
I'm gonna love you forever, I'm gonna love you
You make me feel light as a feather
We're gonna have some fun together
I'm gonna love you
I'm gonna love you
I'm gonna grant all your wishes
I'm gonna give you hugs and kisses
I'm gonna sing you lullabyes at night
Hey baby doll, hey sweet potato
I love you now and I love you later
When I rock you in my arms, it'll be alright
You brought a change in the weather
Things are just going to keep getting better
I'm gonna love you forever, I'm gonna love you
You make me feel light as a feather
We're gonna have some fun together
I'm gonna love you
I'm gonna love you
Hey jelly bean, hey belly botton
You ain't gonna have to worry ‘bout nothin'
I'll be there to take good care of you
I'm gonna love you
I'm gonna love you
I'm gonna love you
I'm gonna love youSee Collin Raye LiveGet tickets as low as $69You might also likeEmbed
