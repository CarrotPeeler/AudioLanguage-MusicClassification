Oh loverboy, to you I belong
Maybe one day you'll wake and you'll find me gone
But loverboy if you call me home

I'll come driving
I'll come driving fast as wheels can turn

Oh loverboy, I know you too well
And all of my lonely secrets to you I tell
The highest of highs, the lowest of lows

I'll come driving
I'll come driving fast as wheels can turn

Driving
I'll come driving
Fast as wheels can turn
Driving
I'll come driving

Stretching away as far as my eyes can see
Deserts and darkness, my hand on the wheel
Loverboy, please call me home
A girl can get lonely out here on the road
A girl can get lonely out here on the road
You might also like
You see some days I find the old ways frighten me too easily
I leave my key and say "I'm too young"
But loverboy, if you call me home
Oh loverboy, if you call me home
Oh loverboy, if you call me home

I'll come driving
I'll come driving fast as wheels can turn

Driving
I'll come driving
Fast as wheels can turn
Driving
I'll come driving
Fast as wheels can turn
Driving
I'll come driving
Fast as wheels can turn
Driving
I'll come driving
Fast as wheels can turn
Driving
I'll come driving
Driving
Driving
I'll come drivingEmbed
