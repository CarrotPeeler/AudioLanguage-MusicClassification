Overbearing drive to break loose
But not to inflict any wounding
Back-breaking social codes break loose
I'm hurtling toward apoplexy

"Conduct inappropriate"
Cry misappropriating know-alls
Conduct inappropriate

Care to neutralise us human germs
Guidelines they so staunchly espouse break loose
Adjustable once they are exposed

"Lifestyles disproportionate"
Cry misappropriating know-alls
Lifestyles disproportionate

Virtuous fawning makes my flesh crawl
Virtuous fawning makes my flesh crawl
Are you some god, king and sage?
God, king and sage?
God, king and sage?
God, king and sage?
