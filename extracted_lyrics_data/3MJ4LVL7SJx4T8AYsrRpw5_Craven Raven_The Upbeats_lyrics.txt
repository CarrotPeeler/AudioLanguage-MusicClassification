3 ContributorsYou Know LyricsYou know
I got bottles in the back
And the money on the tap
Smile on my face
When I step in the place
If you wanna spread hate
Then you better step back
You know (uhh)
Every time that I'm around
They trying to shut it down (trust)
Hot right now
I'm making the crowd shout
For the fire inside
I'm trying to let it out like
Eh yo
Grew a couple of horns on my halo
Bad beats up in the place so
When you get down, better stay low (stay low, stay low)
Eh yo
From the studio to the state show
We be going hard every day, yo
Till I got my brothers on the pay roll (pay roll)
You know, you know
You know, you know
You, you know
(Let's go)
It's going down right now
You might also like(Let's go)
It's going down right now
(Let's go)
It's going down right now
You know
Every time I'm inside
I'm getting them on the hype (yeah)
Mashing up beats
Showing love to the streets
I'll be coming with the heat
Everytime that I ride (yo)
You know (oh)
Every time I'm on the stage
I'm getting them on a wave (drop)
Real to the grave
Cause I got what they crave
I be coming with the flames
That's lighting up the rave like
Eh yo
Grew a couple of horns on my halo
Bad beats up in the place so
When you get down, better stay low (stay low, stay low)
Eh yo
From the studio to the state show
We be going hard every day, yo
Till I got my brothers on the pay roll (pay roll)
You know, you know
You know, you know
You know, you know
You know, you know
You know, you know
You know, you know
You, you know
(Let's go)
It's going down right now
