2 ContributorsClean Sheets Lyrics
Clean sheets
You're lucky if you got 'em, oh I swear you are
But you don't know that, do you?
You're too busy
Stressing and worrying about what you don't got
But you don't know that, do you?

In the streets, walking right past me, I’m like a ghost that you can barely see
And if I catch your eye, you’re passing by and looking down me
Feel a little scared of me, don’t think I don’t notice
How your face switches up, it’s not my fault that I am homeless
I’ll be here tonight, maybe for another week
It’s been a year without a roof, celebrating my anniversary
You only see the worst in me, I’m human you’ve forgotten
If you ever catch me asking you for help
It's only cause I'm running out of options
I ain't stopping, I ain't dropping, write my life out
I've been plotting, taking stock and making options
Counting every penny
Cause it wasn't always like this
I was living pretty good and now I'm thinking why this
Is happening to me, looking back to when I had it all
Bed, lights, and clean sheets, walls I had four
Hoping for more, then life came knocking at my door, said
“Hey, hello, get out — I have a different plan in store for you"
You might also like
Clean sheets
You're lucky if you got 'em, oh I swear you are
But you don't know that, do you?
You're too busy (too busy)
Stressing and worrying about what you don't got
But you don't know that, do you?

Out here in August in the summer sweating like an open faucet, exhausted
No wallet, nothing in my pocket, only losses no message no profit
Come January, and the cold is crazy, I cannot explain it
Feeling shaky, I'm achy, it's rainy, hey lady
With the umbrella, you're going inside
Won't you help a fella out here, don't leave me behind
Give me a sign God, throw me a line, I'm about resign
From this life I'm in, it's been in constant decline
Don't know where my next meal is coming from
Strangers that decided to be nice today left me some leftovers
Then a dog stepped over it
I’m, upset over it
Fought, and stressed over it
I'm over it, anyways
Thank you to the strangers that are taking the time
To help a young lost soul carry on and survive
All I need is clean sheets at the end of the night
And you can sleep better knowing that I'm sleeping on mine
Do you know what it feels like
To be unseen
To be unheard
You'll never know what it feels like
To have nothing at all (to have nothing at all)
Nothing at all
But you’re lucky cause you got some

Clean sheets
You're lucky if you got 'em, oh I swear you are (yeah you’re lucky if you got ‘em)
But you don't know that, do you? (oh I swear you are)
You're too busy
Stressing and worrying about what you don't got (yeah you’re lucky if you got ‘em)
But you don't know that, do you?

Clean sheets (clean sheets)
You're lucky if you got 'em, oh I swear you are
But you don't know that, do you?Embed
