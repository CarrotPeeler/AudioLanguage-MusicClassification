1 ContributorBugs Lyrics
Can't tie me down, won't shut me up
You will not win
The purpose of this song's
To say my life begins

I wanna fly (I wanna fly)
Reach out, be healed (reach out, be healed)
Don't wanna die (don't wanna die)
Like bugs on the windshield
Like bugs on the windshield

I'm driving down a dirt track road
I know nowhere
And up above the heavens spin
I wish me there (I wish me there)

I wanna fly (I wanna fly)
Reach out, be healed (reach out, be healed)
Don't wanna die (don't wanna die)
Like bugs on the windshield
Like bugs on the windshield
You might also like
Don't talk to me, I'm seeing red
You're the last thing in my head

I wanna fly (I wanna fly)
Reach out, be healed (reach out, be healed)
Don't wanna die (don't wanna die)
It's time to steal (it's time to steal)

I wanna fly (I wanna fly)
Reach out, be healed (reach out, be healed)
Don't wanna die (don't wanna die)
Like bugs on the windshield
Like bugs on the windshield
Bugs on the windshield
Like bugs on the windshieldEmbed
