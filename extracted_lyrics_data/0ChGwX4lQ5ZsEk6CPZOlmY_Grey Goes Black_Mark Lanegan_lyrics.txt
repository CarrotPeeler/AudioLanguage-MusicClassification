Grey goes black
Dead white and baby blue
In life there's a falling away
And a sad, sad coming
It rise from the burning tower
It walks in late and early hours
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Grey goes black
Dead white and baby blue
In life there's a falling away
And a sad, sad coming
It rise from the burning tower
It walks in late and early hours
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeahYou might also likeEmbed
