4 ContributorsUntil the End of the World LyricsI'll wait for you until the end of the world
All the weights that keep me down
Seem heavier than before
Fate hits me in my face
Though you feel nothing
Only time will heal you say
Your word's my therapy
But half of me is gone
My dearest treasure torn away

I'll stick with you until the end of the world
I cry out loud but you hear nothing
I'll wait for you until the end of the world
My dearest treasure torn away
All the weights that keep me down
Seem heavier than before
Fate hits me in my face
Though you feel nothing
Only time will heal you say
Your word's my therapy
But half of me is gone
My dearest treasure torn away
You might also like
I'll stick with you until the end of the world
I cry out loud but you hear nothing
I'll wait for you until the end of the world
My dearest treasure torn away
(I'll wait for you until the end of the world)
I'll stick with you until the end of the world
I cry out loud but you hear nothing
I'll wait for you until the end of the world
Half of me is gone, my dearest treasure torn away
I'll stick with you until the end of the world
I cry out loud but you hear nothing
I'll wait for you until the end of the world
My dearest treasure torn awayEmbed
