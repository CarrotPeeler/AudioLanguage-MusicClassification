7 ContributorsThief of Hearts Lyrics
Let me tell you about a man I knew
Yeah, I knew him all too well

Huh, my attitude has always been
You can have me for tonight and not for tomorrow
It's gonna cost you plenty, yeah
More than you can afford or you can borrow
Well I can make 'em fall in love
Just as easy as I pick their pockets, hey
And when I've done the deed
I jump on a freight train and make my getaway

I'm a thief of hearts, a burglar in the night
Before they knew what hit them, I was out of sight
Been a thief of hearts, now I'm paying for my crimes
'Cause now you've gone and stolen mine

Yeah, I met you on a starry night, full moon in your eyes
Did something strange to me
I was all prepared to spin my web, take you for a ride
There was a fork in the street
Well I didn't mean to fall in love
Didn't practice the rules that I've been taught
You never get involved, never drop your defenses
But this time I got caught
You might also like
I'm a thief of hearts, a burglar in the night
Before they knew what hit them, I was out of sight
Been a thief of hearts, now I'm paying for my crimes
'Cause now you've gone and stolen mine

I'm a thief of hearts, paying for my crimes
I'm a thief of hearts, now you've gone and stolen mine

Feels so good
I want more
It should be against the law


I'm a thief of hearts, a burglar in the night
Before they knew what hit them, I was out of sight

I'm a thief of hearts, a burglar in the night
Before they knew what hit them, I was out of sight
Been a thief of hearts, now I'm paying for my crimes
'Cause now you've gone and stolen mine
Been a thief of hearts
Thief of hearts
Been a thief of hearts
I'm a thief of hearts, a burglar in the night
Before they knew what hit them, I was out of sight
Been a thief of hearts, now I'm paying for my crimes
'Cause now you've gone and stolen mineEmbed
