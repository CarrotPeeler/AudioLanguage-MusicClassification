To have a drink or two
As I was marching towards the jukebox
My eyes fell on you
The bartender said youre disengaged
And I saw you trying to look my way
I said wait, stop a minute
I said now dont, go too far
I said wait, stop a minute
Cause I really really really got to have you
I always see you walking in the street
Always looking so nice and neat
Always got you on my mind
I know were gonna have a good time
Bartender said youre disengaged
And I saw you trying to look my way
I said wait, stop a minute
I said now dont, go too far
I said wait, stop a minute
Cause I really really really got to have youYou might also likeEmbed
