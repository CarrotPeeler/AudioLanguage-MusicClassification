5 ContributorsFeather Lyrics (Devin Townsend)
Hey little one, think about our time
When all the pain we’ve overcome
Hey little one, think about a time
When all the boys are older
All I’ll ever think about is you
And you’ll be there when we are through
 (Devin Townsend)
And all are drinking from our hearts
Of all the love that comes apart
Is all for you or all for ‘I’?
I want to wait until we die
 (Katarina Natale, Devin Townsend)
Close your eyes and go to sleep (You’re here afraid yet still you try, as life for me is life through ‘I’)
Close your eyes and go to sleep (If all for three is all for five then we’ll have peace until we die)
Peace to you…
Peace to you…
Peace to you
 (Devin Townsend)
Hey little one, think about a time
When all the waves and oceans rise
Hey little one, think about a time
And all the way, you loaded
All your dolls and toys into the ca
And we are here while you are far
And all I ever think about is you
It’s only father feather
You might also like (Devin Townsend)
Hey little one, think about a time
When all the pain is gone (It’s only feather)
Hey little one, think about a time
When all the pain is gone
They say that heaven was in tune, your point of view
I try to see your point of view
They say that heaven was in tune, your point of view
I try to see your point of view
 (Devin Townsend)
The door opens into your eyes
And I have wondered when we die
He won’t have due this falling ride
As I’ll have to already child
 (Katarina Natale, Devin Townsend)
Close your eyes and go to sleep (So all for you and all for I let's just forgive and let this child…)
Close your eyes and go to sleep (So all for you and all for I let's just forgive and let this lie…)
Peace to you…
Peace to you…
Peace to you
 (Katarina Natale, Devin Townsend)
