1 ContributorNothing Can Replace LyricsSeeing out my senses
Stepping out of grey
Shadows will not find me here
Has love seen better days?
'Cause I'm shattered by my journey
As I faced the accursed sky
Nothing can replace you
There's something here, outside of us
Nothing can replace you 
I wanted you to be with me
The sun's gone and the birds have flown
Fade in dreams of love
Just make me wanna cry
Sworn as the loneliest number
Words are left to say
Love can wait 
Nothing can replace you
There's something here, outside of us
Nothing can replace you You might also like1Embed
