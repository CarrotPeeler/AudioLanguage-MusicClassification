3 ContributorsAngry Times LyricsI'm sitting here thinking what we said last night
Talking 'bout the life we used to know
Got to thinking how the year's gone by
How I insisted there wa so much time
So I got to feeling low
And I decide to make a telephone call
Have you heard the new: John Lennon's dead
For nothing - but John Blast
It's crazy
Hey
Suddenly I realized that I'm destined for angry times
Suddenly
Wow
You know it's crystalized
I got to make it in these angry times
Angry times
I'm just sitting here thinking what we said last night
We talked 'bout the life we used to know
We got to thinking how the year's gone by
We kept insisting there was so much time
Well
I've had my share of ups and downs
You try to make it in this insane town
I've been battered
Beaten
Slowly burned
You know: They didn't leave one stone unturned
Suddenly I realized that I'm destined for angry times. . . 
I got to make it
I'm gonna make it
I got to make it
Angry times
Angry
Angry times
I'm still sitting here thinking what we said last night
Talking 'bout the life we used to know
I got to thinking how the year's gone by
I kept insisting there wa so much time
Suddenly I realized that I'm destined for angry times. . . 
I'm gonna make it
I'm gonna make it
I'm gonna make it
Angry times
Angry
