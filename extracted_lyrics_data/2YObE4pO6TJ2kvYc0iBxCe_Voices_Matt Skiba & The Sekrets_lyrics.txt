3 ContributorsVoices LyricsOn the ceiling there’s a feeling and its spreading like ink that is slowly spilling out from the well
And all the guilt that you felt smiling down from above with a pit inside you deeper than hell
And it’s a crime all the time you spent blaming yourself
All is fine in the shrine of mystery and doubt
And I tried, I tried, I tried to explain they’re in vain but it’s no fucking help
All alone with the voices in your head
Skin and bones hell knows all the poison that you’ve been fed
All alone with the voices in your head
In the dark as you walk hand in hand with the living dead
The living dead
On the floor by the door there’s a sliver of light and a pair of cloven feet standing there
And there’s a knock as the clock strikes 3:33, as you awaken to a living nightmare
And it’s a shame that you blame your bad luck on a girl
You destroy and rejoice as you fuck up the world
And I scream, I scream, I scream and I dream of the day that you’re finally gone
All alone with the voices in your head
Skin and bones hell knows all the poison that you’ve been fed
All alone with the voices in your head
In the dark as you walk hand in hand with the living dead
The living dead
I escaped to a place called Babylon
Through the gates face to face with the seven headed one
I escaped to a place called Babylon
Never to return I’m here to burn eternally home sweet home

Skin and bones hell knows all the poison that you’ve been fed
All alone with the voices in your head
In the dark as you walk hand in hand with the living dead
All alone with the voices in your head
Skin and bones hell knows all the poison that you’ve been fed
All alone with the voices in your head
In the dark as you walk hand in hand with the living deadEmbed
