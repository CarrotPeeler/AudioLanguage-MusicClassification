4 ContributorsDirty Deeds Lyrics
If you're having trouble with the high school head
He's giving you the blues
You wanna graduate but not in his bed
Here's what you gotta do
Pick up the phone, I'm always home
Call me anytime
Just ring 3-6 2-4 3-5-0
I lead a life of crime

Dirty deeds done dirt cheap
Dirty deeds done dirt cheap
Dirty deeds done dirt cheap
Dirty deeds done dirt cheap
Dirty deeds done dirt cheap

If you've got a lady and you want her gone
But you ain't got the guts
She keeps on nagging at you night and day
Enough to drive you nuts

Pick up the phone, leave it alone
It's time you made a stand
For a fee I'm happy to play
Your night time plan

Dirty deeds done dirt cheap
