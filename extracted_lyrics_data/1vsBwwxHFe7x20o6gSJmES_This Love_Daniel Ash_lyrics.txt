3 ContributorsThis Love LyricsRadio was playing
I was knocked out on the floor
Staring at the floor boards
She kicked me to the floor
I said to myself
"This ain't no way to have fun"
Then she looked me in the eye and said
"Your life has just begun"
Now I want some water, not some whiskey
I want some water in this cup
Don't tell me of your fortunes
Then wish me best of luck
I've seen that face before
In a million magazines
All beauty on the outside
And the inside's just as clean
Then she say "Love, it's just not enough"
Then she say "Love, it's just not enough"
Now the telephone's been ringing
And I'm knocking at her door
Standing in the hall she say
"I've seen that face before"

I just come for some more
No, I don't want to own her
I just come for some more of that
Love, it's just not enough
Love, it's just not enough
Love, it's just not enough
Love, it's just not enough
So when the sky's ain't blue
And stars don't shine
And everything ain't right
You go walking down that hallway
See the girl from paradise
Now you won't want to own her
You'll just sit, you'll want to cry
No, you won't want to own her
You'll just sit and wonder why
This love, it's just not enough
This love, it's just not enough
She say, "Love, it's just never enough"
Love, it's just not enough
