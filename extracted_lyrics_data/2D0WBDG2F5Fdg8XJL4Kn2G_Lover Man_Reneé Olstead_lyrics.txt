1 ContributorLover Man LyricsDon't know why but I'm feeling so sad
I long to try something that I've never had
I've never had no kissin', oh, what I've been missin'
Lover man, oh, where can you be?
Oh, the night is so cold and I'm so all alone
I'd give my soul just to call you my own
Got a moon above me, oh, nobody to love me
Lover man, where can you be?
I've heard it said that the thrill of romance
Can be like a heavenly dream
I go to bed with a prayer
You'll make love to me
Strange as it seems
Someday, someday we'll meet
You'll dry all my tears and you'll whisper
Sweet little things in my ear
Hugging and kissing
Oh, what I've been missing
Lover man, where can you be?
I've heard it said that the thrill of romance
Can be like a heavenly dream
I go to bed with a prayer
That you'll make love to me
You might also likeStrange as it seems
Someday we'll meet
And you'll dry all my tears then you'll whisper
Sweet little things in my ear
Oh, hugging and kissing
Ohh, what I've been missing
Lover man, oh, where can you be?
Lover man, oh lover man, where can you be?
Lover man, lover man, where can you be?Embed
