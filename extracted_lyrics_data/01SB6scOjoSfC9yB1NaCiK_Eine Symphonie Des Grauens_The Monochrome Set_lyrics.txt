6 ContributorsEine Symphonie des Grauens Lyrics
I'm dead and dank and rotten
My arms are wrapped in cotton
My corpse loves you, let's marry

Get smart, once - Oh, every night at sleepy time
Get smart, twice - I hang my skin out on the line
Get smart, sing - Oh, darling, would you be, be mine

I'm in love, I think I'm in love
I'm in love, I think I'm in love
I'm in love, I think I'm in lo-o-o-o-ove

I'm caught in a mesh of veins
My fingers and flesh and brains
My skull gives head, so let's wed

Get smart, once - Every night when all alone
Get smart, twice - I drape my flesh around the phone
Get smart, pray - Oh, darling, would you be my own

I'm in love, I think I'm in love
I'm in love, I think I'm in love
I'm in love, I think I'm in lo-o-o-o-o-o-o-ove
You might also like
Don't cry, beautiful, it's just a phase
To the father and the son and the holy ghost
Oh, I chant and I pray, I love
You know God works in mysterious ways
To the father and the son and the holy ghost
Oh, I sing and I pray, I love

I'm soft and slightly stinking
My eyes are small and shrinking
My lips kiss dirt, oh, let's flirt

Get smart, once - Every night at half-past-one
Get smart, twice - There's a little taste of things in come
Get smart, chant - Oh, darling, can I be your son?

I'm in love, I think I'm in love
I'm in love, I think I'm in love
I'm in love, I think I'm in lo-o-o-o-o-o-o-ove

Don't scream, baby, it's just a coma
To the father and the son and the holy ghost
Oh, I chant and I pray, I love
You go to heaven, I go to Roma
To the father and the son and the holy ghost
Oh, I sing and I pray, I loveEmbed
