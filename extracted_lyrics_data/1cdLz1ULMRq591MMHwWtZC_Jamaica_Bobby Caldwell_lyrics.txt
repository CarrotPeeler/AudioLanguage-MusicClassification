5 ContributorsJamaica Lyrics
When the world gets too much to carry
And when life becomes too bizarre
And my friends seem ordinary
As compared to the Rastafar
No, I can’t wait to see the city
Have a drink inside my favorite bar
So if you leave me, that’s a pity
Maybe I’m better of by far

Oh, Jamaica, hold me
Come let your arms enfold me
Forever and ever
Someone told me love grows here in Jamaica
Leaving you how could I ever

As I ran for the ocean ferry
Well, I knew I'd said my last goodbye
And now my life seems so contrary
As the stars fill the evening sky
Oh
Ohohoh
Ohohohoh
You might also like
Oh, Jamaica, hold me
Come let your arms enfold me
Forever and ever
Someone told me love grows here in Jamaica
Leaving you how could I ever
Oh, Jamaica, hold me
Come let your arms enfold me
Forever and ever
Someone told me love grows here in Jamaica
Leaving you how could I ever

Oh oh oh oh oh ohEmbed
