6 ContributorsDo Nothinâ€™ Till You Hear From Me Lyrics
Do nothin' 'til you hear from me
Pay no attention to what's said
Why people tear the seam of anyone's dream
Is over my head
Do nothin' 'til you hear from me
At least consider our romance
If you should take the word of others you've heard
Don't you know, I haven't a chance
(Do nothin' 'til you hear)

True I've been seen with somebody new
But does that mean that I've been untrue?
When we're apart the words in my heart
Reveal how I feel about you

Some kiss may cloud my memory
And other arms may hold a thrill
But please do nothin' 'til you hear it from me
And baby you never will

(Do nothin' 'til you hear from me)
Nothin' 'til you hear from me
(Pay no attention to what's said)
Pay no attention to what's said
(Nothin' 'til you hear)
Why people tear the seam of anyone's dream is over my head
(Do nothin' 'til you hear from me)
Do nothin' 'til you hear from me
(Do nothin' 'til you hear from me)
At least consider our romance
(Nothin' 'til you hear)
If you should take the word of others you've heard
Don't you know, I haven't a chance
You might also like
True I've been seen with somebody new
But does that mean that I've been untrue?
When we're apart the words in my heart
Reveal how I feel about you

Some kiss may cloud my memory
And other arms may hold a thrill
Please do nothin' 'til you hear it from me
You never will

Oh, please do nothin' 'til you hear it from me
You never will
(You never will)Embed
