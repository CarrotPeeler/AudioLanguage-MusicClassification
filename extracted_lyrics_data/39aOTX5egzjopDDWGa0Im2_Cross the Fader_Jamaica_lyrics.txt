1 ContributorCross The Fader Lyrics

Don't hesitate
She's just a girl trying to give you a hand
Job all day long
She's just a girl, why don't you call her on the phone ?
Cause you're a man
You're just a man indeed, don't try to fly your needs
Ain't got the time
The clock is ticking, gotta hurry to make a scene

Show confidence
She's just a girl, trying to give you a hand
Job all day long
She's just a girl, why don't you call her on the phone ?
Cause you're a man
And she's a girl in need, you gotta pack and leave
Ain't got the time
The clock is ticking, gotta hurry to blow a kiss

In a studio
She's a lie in a miniskirt
Please cross the fader
Studio, in a studio
She's a lie in a miniskirt
Please cross the fader
Studio, in a studio
She's a lie in a miniskirt
Please cross the fader
Studio, in a studio
It's about to come out
Because she's on me
You might also like
Don't hesitate
She's just a girl trying to give you a hand
Job all day long
She's just a girl, why don't you call her on the phone ?
Cause you're a man
You're just a man indeed, don't try to fly your needs
Ain't got the time
The clock is ticking, gotta hurry to make a scene

In a studio
She's a lie in a miniskirt
Please cross the fader
Studio, in a studio
She's a lie in a miniskirt
Please cross the fader
Studio, in a studio
She's a lie in a miniskirt
Please cross the fader
Studio, in a studio
It's about to come out
Because she's on me
