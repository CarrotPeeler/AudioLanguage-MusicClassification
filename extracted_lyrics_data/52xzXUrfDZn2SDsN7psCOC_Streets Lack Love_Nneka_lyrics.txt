2 ContributorsStreets Lack Love LyricsThis goes out to you people in the streets
Know it is not easy to survive in this world
Where there is no love, where there is no heart
The things we say, we are, we can never be
You find yourself wandering why
You're sitting in the darkness
Can't find the light in this world
And as we grow old we might understand the truth
The fear of knowing it all
See places where we'll be
We never thought we would see
This goes out to you people in the streets
Know it is not easy to survive in this world
Where there is no love, where there is no heart
The things we say, we are, we can never be
You will see we want the things we never have
Continuously dreaming, yeah
I know as long as we believe, we can get outta this
Together we'll achieve
And sometimes they wanna see your down fall
Think of their own profits and make you misuse
Your fellow brothers and sisters, your family, your friends
We just don't know what to do

Know it is not easy to survive in this world
Where there is no love, where there is no heart
The things we say, we are, we can never be
For nearly 60 years in Nigeria
People have been suffering from gas flaring, and pollution
Because of big oil extraction companies such as Shell, Chevron, NNPC
The Niger Delta, the Warri and the Ogoni people have pleading for a change
They have been fighting fot justice
But the companies, Europe and Nigerian government do not seem to care
Do not seem to be bothered, they can't be botheredEmbed
