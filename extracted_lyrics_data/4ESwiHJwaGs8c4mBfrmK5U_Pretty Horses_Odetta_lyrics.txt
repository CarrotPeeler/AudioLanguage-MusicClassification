1 ContributorPretty Horses LyricsHush-a-bye, don't you cry
Go to sleepy little baby
When you wake, you shall have
All the pretty little horses
Blacks and bays, dapples and greys
All the pretty little horses
Way down yonder in the meadow
Lies a poor little lamby
Bees and the butterflies pickin' on it's eyes
Poor little thing is cryin' Mammie
Blacks and bays, dapples and greys
All the pretty little horses
When you wake, you shall have
All the pretty little horsesYou might also likeEmbed
