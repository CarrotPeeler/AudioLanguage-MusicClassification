1 ContributorThey Donâ€™t Even Know LyricsJust cos you rappers built a bigger buzz don't mean I'm jealous
Just cos I'm killing yall with mixtapes don't mean you should be embarrassed
Finna move my parents out into that palace
Kick their feet up while sipping red, red wine from a chalice in Paris
Let em know their son finally did it
Turned a blurred vision, flipped it til it became vivid
But I ain't tripping, I'm chasing the dream so I can live it
And these cliche rappers with a buzz have no clue what they triggered
Bringing the heat so it's bout to be a warm winter
Crossing lines, making sure they're re-drawn thinner
Walking round with a low soul, but my chin up
And word to Biggie and Cole that I'm just another Born Sinner
Cos it's all a dream, no one can take it
How much are you willing to sacrifice in order to be called "the greatest"?
Got the nerve ask me for favours
All because my tracks are the only thing bumping in your girlfriends playlist
Got word people believe in me
- told me in private I can steal this game easily
Caught a cab to the club last night
And heard his shit play on the radio and thought "damn, thats where we should be"
Proud man, but this year I'm coming for it
Sat back too long - you don't understand my hunger for it
Kept delaying this mixtape to be finished
And I guess I should explain why but all of thats another story
Remember when I made my first thousand dollars?
Thought "not bad for a kid who dropped outta college"
Dad congratulated me and now I'm finna see
His reaction if I managed to put a mill in his pockets
I'll do it for you
I'll do it for you
I'll do it for you
And I'll do it for you
Tell it like I got something to prove
Cos my generations brainwashed and I feel it needs to improve
I'm not perfect, dog, but tell me what that's like
Still doper than that shit in your crack pipe
Been quiet for a few years
But I ain't never stopped rapping for a single day - get your facts right
They say express yourself Dre, put your city on it
They'd be offended if I was to be completely honest
Knew if I stayed that I'd grow to be a failure
So I packed my shit and looked for more options in Australia
And it kills me not being home
It kills me none of my grandparents lived long enough to see me grow
So I'm doing this for them and everyone thats ever shown me love
And everybody else should be afraid cos they don't even know
They don't-they don't even know
Everybody else should be afraid cos they don't even know
Young freshman rapping like a motherfucking pro
And all you hating mothersuckers gonna find it hard to cope
I was off for a while now I'm back with some clarity
Staring at me like I'm bout to treat you like a charity
But I won't spend a dollar on ya bruh
Middle finger to those who saw my vision and treated it like a parody
You might also likeStaring up at the top like it's vacant
You're highly mistaken if you think you're taking
This, many years in the making
It's a one-man invasion, I'm shaking the nation
Cos Dre be going hard like I soaked up Gamma radiation
You're facing a Thracian, aiming to be every rappers replacement
Ball so hard til I make it out the basement
And every track that I'm lacing right now
Is a preview of everything you'll hear on every radio station
So, let it play, let it play, let it play
Took my ass outta school and discovered another way
Visions of sold out shows
Performing songs the whole crowd knows
Telling myself that'll be you someday
If I can make it out, then we all getting famous
If I make it count, then we all getting paid
If I can aim high enough, we all touch the sky
Have our head up in the clouds like we all getting blazed up
I've waited too long for my moment
But things are bout to change, thought I'd warn my opponents
I'm back for the title, you can put that on the bible
Til I collab with my idols, I'm overlapping my rivals
To me it's more than a dream, it's vital man it's life
Putting in work cos I ain't go viral over night
Taking zero days off, just praying this pays off
Time to show you what this Kiwi kid is made ofEmbed
