1 ContributorDanny Myers vs Ron Compton Lyrics
The slug'll open his chest, and exit out his back, bitch I been hood
Bullets’ll be right outside of Compton like Lynwood!
Big blade, sharp as fuck, normally I'm .9 holdin'
I’ll slit his baby throat, he'll mourn for his daughter he's Ron Goldman
You won''t want this crude rumble, I'll crack yo' ass then take the tool from you
I'll pop you, then sneak ya kid the .40 like the cool uncle
I’m with whatever bitch, blade to his throat..then I tear the shit
He gon’ be like {cough cough}... like he tryna learn Arabic
I need a therapist!, I'll show no remorse after the body rot
Forty .9’s be in his face soon as we hit Ronnie Lot
Get ya body chopped, this knife'll cause plenty of devastation
I'll cut Compton off from the rest of the country like a Indian Reservation
I'll hop in his vehicle, pistol whip him, give em a hard time
Since he wanna be in the Mafia, I’ll tell the nigga the car mine (Carmine)
These police want us dead, laid in the streets from the flame
Ron...our test (Artest) is to bring peace to our names
Bitch I like fightin', I'm the competitive one
They knew I was the bomb with the forearm since Predator One
This is Danny vs Cameron, start placin' ya bets
Y'all gone see me put a murder on Cam like Faces Of Death
Let me catch you in traffic and you pull off, I promise to let the mag' chase ya
I'll shoot (Chute) out the back of ya car like a drag racer
You battled up and comers, now you facin' the GOAT, to test our limits
That bitch Finesse pussy must got powers in it
I shower with it, watch how quick I get his soul floored
Bullets begging me to let em out like a parole board
Oh Lord!, When I got that Sig' on try me
I'll go to this Player's Club and wig on Ronnie
I'll watch him talk shit, 'til I crack his jaw, and he can't no more
He'll be forced to chew...on one side of his mouth like a canker sore
Bitch I came for war, they got me matched with a lame rasta
Bat to his spine he won't stand with the same posture
Do you believe in a Parallel Universe? I do, it's insane patna
A OG said, "I can live life by diggin' for jewels", then he was killed by a grave robber
I hold that gauge proper, in case his niggas get to trippin'
They get that Henny, and wanna shoot soon as they get to sippin'
This ain't the 1920's
But Mafia better control how much liquor his niggas gettin'
We can fight nigga, you don't need the gun from Myers
Soon as you see me and black box you'll know it's only one survivor
I'll rip a lung inside ya, .38 and the fo' spray
After you get this power couple, it'll be so Genuine where ya soul lay (Sole)!
You'll be a cold case, you can't handle these beatings
I'll teach you kids How To Get Away With Murder like Analise Keating
They think Danny be cheatin', I can get you stomped in minutes
Then I'll send some YGs to wherever Compton men is (Menace)
All my comp' is finished, and you on the ground with this shit
This wack MC got another two rounds of this shit
Yikes!
You might also like
I can't grow dreads, and I'm jealous, I got that thang cocked
I aim shots and shoot up ya hair Ron (Heron) until my veins pop
Bar after bar, let's straight to the eulogy
I gotta punch in numbers on holmes (homes) like a gated community
I shoot iron, Geechi Gotti the homie, but ya group dyin'
You tried to become a rasta, but nobody respected that shit like Snoop Lion
You'll get a proper death, up close, my gun got a block of flesh
But the meat slide off of the iron, it's like a copper chef
I'll sock his shit, rock his shit, cold drop this bitch
I fight well, so him grabbin' a gun is a compliment
Consider this an accomplishment
You sold ya soul for these views now deal with the apocalypse
Peep the Revelation, let me get my thesis in
The strap'll leave his feet burnt Bronze like Jesus skin!
I need this win, or I'll fire the strap rapido
Tell Champion...I'm coming for Blac (Black) belt like Ralph Machio
This ain't Karate Kid, this the streets where the Glocks smokin'
I'll shoot a thousand clips like claymation...until he stops motion
I'm not jokin', don't lie to me, niggas confide in me
They trust me cause my input harder than doin' a tiger knee
When you write for me, you gotta be from a ancient bloodline rightfully
Cause I might just be the only nigga with a copy of the Bible 3!
This ain't a rivalry, I'm just prompted to let the heat pop
I'll leave so much smoke in him Compton'll never Detox!
Piece cocked, 30 shot, ya family killed
Then a lot'll (lotta) fly in ya attic like Amityville!
Danny is skilled, I done seen ill dreams die out
You think it's only rap til a real beam fly out
I'll paralyze ya daughter
Ya baby'll have to practice her steps again like drill team try outs
I will shoot you in yo stab wound, yo shit gone be all scarred up
That means these bullets tryna park in the cut like a car fuck
Keep yo guard up, it ain't about the rhymes I could spit
Shhh!!! Long as I dot yo eye (i) and cross yo tee (t) I ain't got time for this shit
Inside my mind is a cliff, if I jump off, I won't fall
Gravity's an illusion and my pad is the conclusion
It's sad that he is losin', but my lyrics is the best
I'm gang neutral, I ain't out here trippin' with the sets
You ain't Bruno Mars
But I'll shoot you while you on top of ya bitch and have you 'Drippin' In Finesse'
You in Geechi shadow forever nigga, I got the most on it
I'm Straight Checkin' Em, you ain't even Compton's Most Wanted
Fuck yo' music too, we'll run in yo' lab and get yo' goons smoked
Ya crew will leave Earth in the studio like the Moon Hoax
I tomb folks, you'll need forensics to see this bitch features
Ya skeleton'll have a story to tell like a crypt keeper!
Big heater lay him down, and you on the ground with this shit
This wack MC got a whole 'nother round of this shit
Yikes!
.45 and a hunting knife
The clip destroy these homies
But the assistant allowed to go in the back like "Employees Only"
My mind contains the secrecy of a Masonic lodge
Thoughts travel faster than the bullet you tryin' to dodge
I personify the op' and the symbolism
You been a victim of the emperial of lyricism
I hear it in him
The fear in his Bible shit
You standin' in front of a higher power, feel my chakras lit
Mexican strap, black gat that I can pop him with
So I can properly pop him so he can reflect the populace
Wasn't for the oppulence
I write the end of your story with the same pen I write the synopsis with
I'm from the metropolis
These bars leave this bitch severed
Compton ain't get beat like this since Quik dropped his diss record
I lift Hecklers
Your team on some fuck shit
Your major cool with Gotti? That's the seeds of corruption
This the eve of destruction
For MC's intending to breathe and function take heed to these instructions
Don't think, cause you had a couple battles that's noteworthy
You can skip some levels and battle niggas that's GOAT worthy
Quote 30
Lines
Show me where Ron is spazzin'
But to get bars from Compton you're gonna need a Chronic album
He'll need a squad just to say he beat rappers
Only wack niggas Finesse they way into elite status
You need practice
You didn't make a wise decision
You a fake conscious nigga that don't improve the lives of children
I envision
A time when brothers are guided with the livest wisdom
To avoid serving time in these private prisons
I just give him
Five incissions
 with cyanide inside ya system
So him and Finesse can battle 
This guy's a victim like  actors
If you caught that on the low you know I'm one of the nicest rappers
I'm more disappointed in what you didn't say
Up close the blood shot will be beautiful like 
How the fuck did these Compton niggas be seen equal
Y'all think Gotti the best? Where is King Rico?
The beam hit you, stomach shot, make your body a mess
Why y'all put the Mafia in front of Elliot Ness?
That's not a cop out
I'll fire the clip until it drop out
It's too late for diplomacy
I'm great with this poetry
Your woman is fine, a lot of niggas have spite for you
The irony, y'all will never break up because she write (right) for you
I got in this game cause I felt a void
But I knew I could rise when I felt like it like I'm self employeed
You actually helped my ploy
You set this up you got yourself destroyed
Now I gotta kill somebody else's boy
Bar God!
You on the ground with this shit
Thank the Lord he ain't got another round of this shit
Yikes!Embed
