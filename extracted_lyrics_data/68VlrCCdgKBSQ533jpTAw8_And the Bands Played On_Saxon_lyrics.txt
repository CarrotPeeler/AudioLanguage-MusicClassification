7 ContributorsAnd the Bands Played On Lyrics
Just before dawn, in the cold light
We came out of the night
Great expectation, from the man who ran the show
Will it rain? Will it snow? Will it shine? We don't know
Are there clouds up in the sky?

We sat in the sun, woah-oh-oh
And the bands played on
And the bands played on
And the bands played on

See the people, feel the power
There was sixty thousand there
Just like thunder, the crowds began to roar
Were you there? Did ya know? Did ya see? All the show
There was magic in the air

We sat in the sun woah-oh-oh
And the bands played on
And the bands played on
And the bands played on
See Saxon LiveGet tickets as low as $55You might also like
See the rainbow, shining brightly
Shooting rockets to the sky
Making music, and it, rolled on through the night
You could hear, on the air, rock n' roll, everywhere
We were strangers in the night

We sat in the sun woah-oh-oh
And the bands played on
And the bands played on
And the bands played on
And the bands played on
And the bands played onEmbed
