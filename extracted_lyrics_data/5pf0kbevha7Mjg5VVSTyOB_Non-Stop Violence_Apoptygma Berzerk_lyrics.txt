3 ContributorsNon Stop Violence LyricsCome close, step inside
Radiance from the dying world
Contagious and careless
You're spreading your disease among us
Warm sweat, no regret
All you see is the TV set
While people around you
Are dying like flies
Non-stop violence, they feed us cascades
Of non-believers dying in the sand
Feeding us with violence, we face the fall of man
Believe me, and catch me if you can
Catch me if you can!
Come close, step inside
Radiance from the dying world
Contagious and careless
You're spreading your disease among us
White noise in your ears
Your eyes look like monitors
But what you need is silence
And a positive vibe
Not your TV!

Of non-believers dying in the sand
Feeding us with violence, we face the fall of man
Believe me, and catch me if you can
Catch me if you can...
So I took shelter in tomorrow
Tomorrow will bring a brand new day
Think I make it by tomorrow
Think I need more sleep today
Lets play for keeps again tomorrow
I need a pill to stay awake
I guess I'll always hate tomorrow
Until it's far away...away...Embed
