1 ContributorWhite Freight Liner Blues (Nashville Sessions) Lyrics
I'm goin' out on the highway
Listen to them big trucks whine
I'm goin' out on the highway
Listen to them big trucks whine
Ah White Freightliner
Won't you steal away my mind

Well New Mexico ain't bad, Lord
And the people there they treat you kind
Well New Mexico ain't bad, Lord
And the people there they treat you kind
Ah White Freightliner
Won't you steal away my mind


Well, it's bad news from Houston
Half my friends are dying
Well, it's bad news from Houston
Half my friends are dying
White Freightliner
Won't you steal away my mind
You might also like
Lordy, Lord I'm gonna ramble
Till I get back to where I came
Ah Lord, I'm gonna ramble
Till I get back to where I came
Till that White Freightliner
Gonna haul away my brain

I'm goin' out on the highway
Listen to them big trucks whine
I'm goin' out on the highway
Listen to them big trucks whine
Ah White Freightliner
Won't you steal away my mindEmbed
