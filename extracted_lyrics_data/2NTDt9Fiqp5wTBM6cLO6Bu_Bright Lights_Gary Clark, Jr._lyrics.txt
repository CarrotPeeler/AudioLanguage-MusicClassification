10 ContributorsBright Lights Lyrics
Woke up in, woke up in New York City lyin' on the floor
Just outside of Marcy's, west fifty four, well
You're gonna know my name by the end of the night, yeah
You're gonna know my name by the end of the night

Bright lights, big city going to my head
Bright lights, big city going to my head
Bright lights, big city going to my head
I don't care, no, 'cause you don't care, no

Start off with the bottle ended up with the bottle
Taking shots, waitin' on tomorrow
Tryna' fill up what's hollow
You're gonna know my name
You're gonna know my name

Bright lights, big city going to my head
Bright lights, big city going to my head
Bright lights, big city going to my head
I don't care, no, 'cause you don't care, no

Get lost in the city, try to find myself
I went up a different person, came down somebody else
I know it ain't right, but it's all in my head
Oh, I'm surprised that I'm still alive, I should be dead

Bright lights, big city going to my head
Bright lights, big city going to my head
Bright lights, big city going to my head
I don't care, no, 'cause you don't care, no

Oh, you're gonna know my name
(Yeah, yeah)
You're gonna know my name
(Hey, hey hey)
You're gonna know my name
Well, you're gonna know my name
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, uh)
(You're gonna know my name)
(You're gonna know my name)
Hey, you're gonna know my name by the end of the night, well5Embed
