How in the world we gonna make everything in time?
Train burning, all night burning
Trainfire up and down the line
How in the world we gonna make everything alright?
How in the world we gonna make everything in time?
Train burning, all night burning
Trainfire up and down the line
Sexy seventeen year old
Moving me up and down the pole
You won't tell me what I need to know
So the train burns, all night burns
Trainfire up and down the line
Move me
How in the world we gonna make everything alright?
How in the world we gonna make everything on time?
Train burning, all night burning
Trainfire
Trainfire up and down the line
Sexy seventeen year old
Moving me up and down the pole
She don't tell me what I need to know
Train upon the quantum, a Kai, the string theory
Trainfire up and down the line!

So, you called my name
Left on a weary road beyond your ways
May all the other colors of your name
