12 ContributorsSwan Lyrics
The swan sang with a broken neck
Out by the pool, behind the fence
You can't forgive me when
You know if I had the gun
I'd choose to shoot again

He raised my hands in the backyard
He taught me to be a good shot
You love the sound of "sorry"
Even when you know I am not
I am not

In the holy land of broken homes
You still pretend you don't know
That I took it out back and I
Snapped its neck just like
A wishbone and I let it die

He raised my hands in the backyard
He taught me to be a good shot
You love the sound of "sorry"
Even when you know I am not
I am notYou might also likeEmbed
