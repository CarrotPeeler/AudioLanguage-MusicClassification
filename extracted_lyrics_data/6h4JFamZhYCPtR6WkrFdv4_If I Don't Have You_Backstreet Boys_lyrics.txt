7 ContributorsIf I Donâ€™t Have You Lyrics
Everyday girl, I wake up and pray
That you'll come back home
And don't take to long
'Cause since you've been gone
Everything's gone a bit wrong
I wish you were here
Holding me near

You know I'd go out of my mind
If you ever left my love behind
So I'm beggin' you please
(So I'm beggin', beggin' you please)
Bring your sweet love back to me
(Please come back to me)

If I don't have you (Don't have you)
To hold on to (To hold on to)
I can't go on in this world alone
Baby, it's true (Baby, it's true if I don't have you)
If you said goodbye (You said goodbye)
Girl, I would die (Girl, I would die)
I'm a star with no light, a day with no night
If I don't have you
You might also like
Late at night, I reach to hold you tight
But you're not there
(You're just not there, baby)
I know you still care
(I know you still care)
And oh, how I miss your soft and love, lovely kiss
You'd give to me (To me)
So tenderly

We used to feel
That time would stand still
When I see you baby, it will
So hurry home
(So hurry, come home to me)
You know your man needs you so
(Oh girl, can't you see)
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh

If I don't have you (Don't have you)
To hold on to (To hold on to)
I can't go on in this world alone
Baby, it's true (Baby, it's true if I don't have you)
If you said goodbye (You said goodbye)
Girl, I would die (Girl, I would die)
I'm a star with no light, a day with no night
If I don't have you
If I don't have you (Don't have you)
(If I don't have you, no-no)
To hold on to (To hold on to)
(I just wanna hold you)
I can't go on (Can't go on) in this world alone
Baby, it's true (Baby, it's true if I don't have you)
(Baby-baby) If you said goodbye (You said goodbye)
(If you said goodbye, I would die)
Girl, I would die (Girl, I would die)
(I would die if I don't have you)
I'm a star with no light (No light), a day with no night
If I don't have you

You know I'll go crazy without you (If I don't have you)
(If I don't have you, no-no)
To hold on to (To hold on to)
(I just wanna hold you)
I can't go on (Can't go on) in this world alone (In this world alone)
Baby, it's true (Baby, it's true if I don't have you)
If you said goodbye (You said goodbye)
(If you said goodbye, I would die)
Girl, I would die (Girl, I would die)
(Girl, I know I would die)
I'm a star with no light
A day with no night
If I don't have youEmbed
