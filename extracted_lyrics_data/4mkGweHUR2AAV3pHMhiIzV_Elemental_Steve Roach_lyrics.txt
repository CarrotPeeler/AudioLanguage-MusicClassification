1 ContributorTemple of Solomon Lyrics(Steven Newman)
Sun lays its rays on the Mother Earth
Then the rain comes down - now they’re giving birth
Sun lays its rays on the Mother Earth
Then the rain comes down - now they’re giving birth
(Steven Newman & YashAkasha)
Rattle the cage with a rattle and sage
‘Cause you know we’re feeling ready for this Aquarian Age
Rattle the cage with a rattle and sage
‘Cause you know we’re feeling ready for this Aquarian Age
(YashAkasha)
Servin’ as a column
In the Temple of Solomon
Spirits yeah we call ‘em in
With names we be callin’ ‘em
No need to be solemn and
No need to be gloomy
They pittin’ Shia vs Sunni
We mixin’ Tumi with Rumi
And givin’ thanks to the elemental forces that grew we
So let the lighters be raised
We givin’ thanks ‘n praise
Prayin’ to preserve the ancestral ways
Never crazed, never phased
Fire blaze for days
Clear the haze out the maze where the spirit plays

Then the rain comes down - now they’re giving birth(X4)

Rattle the cage with a rattle and sage
‘Cause you know we’re feeling ready for this Aquarian Age
Rattle the cage with a rattle and sage
‘Cause you know we’re feeling ready for this Aquarian Age
(YashAkasha)
Shown how to use a microphone
To get the truth inside of every breaka-bone like the marrow
Fly like a sparrow
Carryin’ the message on the path that is narrow
Overthrow the pharaoh with a flaming arrow
Cast an I-Ching with the stalks of the yarrow
Pull another Tarot
Here it goes
Keep it at the barest bones
And our hair it grows
To our bare toes
And we wear stones
And our only cologne is our pheromones
‘Cause it scares drones away
