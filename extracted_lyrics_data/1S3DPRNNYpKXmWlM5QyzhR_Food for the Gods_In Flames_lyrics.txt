6 ContributorsFood for the Gods Lyrics
Shame marries the guilt
Introduces itself to the concept of total loneliness!
Sensations repressed
Make friends with suicidia!
And here the leeches begin
To suck away the lust for life!

Escape takes the lead into a world unknown
Uncontrolled by all
Where borders are erased and potential infinite

Chosen cells, glands and transmitters
Blast the body with joy!
Astral feet running up
To dimensions covered with gold!
Stairs of glowing ectoplasma
Sapphire, onyx, and buzzing vibrations!
A dead men's banquet
Food for the gods!

There's only one real world
Our Earth is but a shadow!
Created from a child's heart, a living jewel
From now on abode for a soul in its setting!

Escape takes the lead into a world unknown
Uncontrolled by all
Where borders are erased and potential infinite

Chosen cells, glands and transmitters
Blast the body with joy!
Astral feet running up
To dimensions covered with gold!
Stairs of glowing ectoplasma
Sapphire, onyx, and buzzing vibrations!
A dead men's banquet
Food for the gods!

Cutting the bloodline
Re-tie the bleeding roots
To a heavenly slip of glass!
And let it drift in passive arrogance
In a one-word dialogue with the stars!

Escape takes the lead into a world unknown
Uncontrolled by all
Where borders are erased and potential infinite
Chosen cells, glands and transmitters
Blast the body with joy!
Astral feet running up
To dimensions covered with gold!
Stairs of glowing ectoplasma
Sapphire, onyx, and buzzing vibrations!
A dead men's banquet
Food for the gods!Embed
