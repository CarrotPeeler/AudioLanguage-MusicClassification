3 ContributorsOne Second of Insanity LyricsDamn you make up your mind
I pop a pill at a time
And you've got it crawling like my skin
When you don't want to be found
You dig a hole in the ground
Choke down the filth you're living in
Is this the reason I've been low?
If this is wrong then let me go
It's a long way down
But you never listen
It's the wrong time now
But you never give in (yeah)
Smash your grip on control
For sale sign on your soul
Bite down, smile and take the pain
Pressure tested to break
What choice will you make?
One second or Infinity?
Is this the reason I've been low?
If this is wrong then let me go
It's a long way down
But you never listen
It's the wrong time now
But you never give in
You might also likeGive me one second to breathe!
One second
One-one-one one second
One Second
One second
Is a long time now
But you never listen
It's the wrong way around
But you never give inEmbed
