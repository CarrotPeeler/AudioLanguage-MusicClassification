3 ContributorsWhy Me LyricsWhen there's a heart to be broken
Why mine, Why mine
When there are arms to left longing
Why mine, Why mine
Of all the other fishes swimming in the sea
Why'd you have to come and pick on me
Why me, why me, why me
When there are dreams to be shattered
Why mine, why mine
When theres a soul left searching
Why mine, why mine
It seems every time that I take a chance
I always wind up with a broken romance
Why me, why me, why me
How could you fall in love with someone else
After saying you love me
I was so surprised when I realized you were making a fool of me
When there are lips to be kissing
Why mine, why mine
When there are eyes left crying
Why mine, why mine
You might also likeBaby when I said that I love you
Why'd you have to break my heart in two
Why mine, why mine, why mineEmbed
