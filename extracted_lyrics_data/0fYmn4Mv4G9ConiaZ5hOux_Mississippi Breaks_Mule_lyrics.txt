2 ContributorsMississippi Breaks LyricsWe left town to the sound of buckshot rain
Falling, before our eyes, to Walsh
Pushed through and found ourselves
At the end of the road
Far from the hand of the law
I don't think we're welcome back there
But I don't really like the way they live
Never knowing from one minute to the next
What's his or yours, or yours or his, or what else
I ain't used to asking for nothing
I take what I want
My momma never told me nothing
I didn't have to go out and figure for myself
Been running so long
I feel like I'll be running when I catch my dying breath
It ain't the little things that kill you
It's what they come to add up to
I just wish I didn't hear her voice
In all the evil that I do
I ain't used to asking for nothing
I take what I want
By the time we got to Medicine Hat
It was plain we couldn't hold out til the lake
Said to the boys better pull out
Cut our loses 'fore the Mississippi breaks
Straight up and went about our ways
I ain't seen none of them boys since
I just hope my path don't double me back
To where the trouble is again
You might also likeI ain't used to asking for nothing
I take what I wantEmbed
