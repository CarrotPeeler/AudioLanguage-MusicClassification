4 ContributorsLiving It Down Lyrics
A terrible beauty is bored
Mick steps out of the 27th floor
And views the babylon below
With couples, dogs and children, scurry to and fro
It's been a long hard life
And now he's nearly 21
He's read the sermons on the mount
"They're not for me"
I'll never live to 23

Down Down Down (yoohoo)
Down Down Down (yoohoo)
Down Down Down (yoohoo)
Down Down Down (yoohoo)

The air is cleaner here on high or so it seems
There must be chemicals that rise
I've got those flying dreams
The aeroplanes and helicopters pass much closer by
If I could just reach out and touch the sky
He sees a never ending search for sex and sulph and squats and fun
He neversees a villa in the sun
But yet there's one way
He'll make sure he's not depressed
And maybe get a notice
In the local press and it's
You might also like
Down Down Down (yoohoo)
Down Down Down (yoohoo)
Down Down Down (yoohoo)
Down Down Down (yoohoo)
The sky is glistening with light or so it seems
Outside the day turns into night
Inside the alligator screams
The aeroplanes and helicopters pass much closer now
I spread my aviator wings
The air is cleaner here on high or so it seems
The must be chemicals that rise I've got those flying dreams
The aeroplanes and helicopters pass much closer by
If I could just reach up and touch the sky
If I could just reach up and touch the skyEmbed
