8 ContributorsChase The Tear Lyrics
Looking out, looking in
Going where never been
Running round my defenses
Been afraid, felt the grain
Open doorways full of shame
My own life I resented

Winter sigh, summer's gone
Holding off tomorrow's sorrow

Rushing out, Rushing in
Losing out, losing the
Identity of my heart
Didn't fold, chase the tear
Never let go, now I'm there
It's over, it's over

Winter sigh, summer's gone
Holding off tomorrow's sorrow
So I won't anymore
Winter sigh, summer's gone
Holding off tomorrow's sorrow
So I won't anymoreYou might also likeEmbed
