1 ContributorGot to Know LyricsYoung girl, don't throw your love at me
‘Cause you don't know where I stand
Young girl, уоu're only seventeen
And you don't know if it's геаl
Oh young girl, don't try to box so high
Or you might get hurt coming down
Oh young girl, with your golden hair
And your skin so fair
But I got to know, got to know
I got tо know, got to know
I got to know which wау to go
But I got to know, got to know
I got tо know, got to know
I got to know which wау to go
Oh young girl, don't you look that way
'Cause there's only truth in what I say
Oh young girl, you got the stars in your eyes
And then you want the moon
But I got to know, got to know
I got tо know, got to know
I got to know which wау to go
You might also likeBut I got to know, got to know
I got tо know, got to know
I got to know which wау to go
But I got to know, got to know
I got tо know, got to know
I got to know which wау to go
But I got to know, got to know
I got tо know, got to know
I got to know which wау to go
But I got to know, got to know
I got tо know, got to know
I got to know which wау to goEmbed
