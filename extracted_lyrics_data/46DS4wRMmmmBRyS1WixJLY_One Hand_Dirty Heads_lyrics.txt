5 ContributorsOne Hand Lyrics
We live like Titans, we live immortal
The uninvited, the other side of the road
We are the right hand, you are the mortar
We'll build you up and then make you the cornerstone
See mirrored mountains painted in water
We will disturb them, jump in and bring 'em to life

Ohh, one hand comes after the other
Ohh, no time to run for cover
Ohh, feels like I'm climbin' forever
Ohh, one hand comes after the other

I feel the weight of the world upon my shoulders
It feels like the weather outside is getting colder
No sense in hiding, I just keep climbing
The sky is the limit and that's right behind me
I can feel it coming down harder than before
God speed, keep steady, man, heavy is the storm
Be warned and be told
Time won't wait for the helpless
I'll rest when I'm dead, 'till then I'm livin' restless
Yes, you can't hold me down 'cause my confidence is constant
I'm killin' this shit, Death Wish, Charles Bronson
Look around man the whole world is watching
What you gonna say, take caution

Ohh, one hand comes after the other
Ohh, no time to run for cover
Ohh, feels like I'm climbin' forever
Ohh, one hand comes after the other
(One hand comes after the other, one hand comes after the other)

Realizing everything in life is beautiful
I know this world can make us crazy, act like animals
I've seen the worst and now I know there's always brighter days
Once you reach the bottom, ups the only other way
I keep on climbing 'till I find just what I'm lookin' for
Can't stop me now, I'm going to climb until I can't no more
We take our chances and sometimes they have the price to pay
That's just the way it goes, there ain't no other way

Ohh, one hand comes after the other
Ohh, no time to run for cover
Ohh, feels like I'm climbin' forever
Ohh, one hand comes after the other
Ohh, feels like I'm climbin' forever
Ohh, one hand comes after the other

One hand comes after the other
One hand comes after the other
One hand comes after the other
One hand comes after the otherEmbed
