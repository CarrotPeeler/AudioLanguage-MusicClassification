You get me
You get me right there baby now
Some sensation
Making love when saying your name out loud
And conversation
There's no need for it when you're around
'Cause
Talking 'bout your love, and where you use it
Baby pick me up, and never put me down
Talking 'bout your love, and never will I abuse it, no
'Cause oh, we're, baby, going round and round and round
You get me
You get me
You get me right there baby now
You get me
You get me
You get me right there baby now
A few attraction
Just touching your body when you hold me in your arms
Pure satisfaction, when we getting it on it's because you're the only one
You might also likeTalking 'bout your love, and where you use it
Baby pick me up, and never let me down
Talking 'bout your love, and never will I abuse it, no
