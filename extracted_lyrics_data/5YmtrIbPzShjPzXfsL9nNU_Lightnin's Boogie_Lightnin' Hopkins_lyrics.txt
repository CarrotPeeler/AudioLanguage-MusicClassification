2 ContributorsLightninâ€™s Boogie Lyrics
What's the matter with you baby, say you wanna boogie?
Well I don't exactly feel like it
But I guess I'll boogie with you a little while, isn't it now
Now what we're gonna do now is boogie
Now teach your sisters now, what they havin' down there?
A boogie woogie thing?
Well, alright baby, let's go

See you're tryin' to shake it up now, don't do that
I'm gettin' too old to wheel on the floor like I used to
But that's watch this lick Imma put down
Play it, boy, ooo wee
That's what I'm talkin' about
Make them old bass's cut up for me again
So I can sass a little
Cut it up

Make me, think about it when it tell you you swing
You and I swing Mama, and then
We'll be truckin' on down the line
Come on young girl, don't go slowin' back
I'm an old man and you're gettin' tired alreadyYou might also likeEmbed
