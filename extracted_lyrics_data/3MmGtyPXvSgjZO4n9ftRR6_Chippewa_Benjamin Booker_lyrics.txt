3 ContributorsChippewa LyricsWhere’d you get them clothes?
Where’d you get them shoes?
Last time I saw you, you were singing them blues
Where’d you get that scar
Where’d you get that bruise
You had it all you just had to choose
She don’t mind the whirlwind coming
And she ain’t looking down the road
And she don’t mind the loneliness
But she do mind not eating for days
And you've gotta find a better way
And you've gotta find a better way
Where you walking now?
Where you wanna go?
It’s alright girl to tell him no
I don’t know what’s going on in that head
But I do know what’s going on in that bed
Why do you need someone to love you to love yourself?
Sometimes I find we all need help (I got plenty of empty bottles girl)
I’ll see you in the morning Margeaux dear
And if I don’t it will all be clearSee Benjamin Booker LiveGet tickets as low as $33You might also likeEmbed
