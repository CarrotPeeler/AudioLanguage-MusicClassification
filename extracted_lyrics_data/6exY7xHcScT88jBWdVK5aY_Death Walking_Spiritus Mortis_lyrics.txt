1 ContributorDeath Walking Lyrics"Wake up, it's time to die!"
Tears disappear in the rain
"I know", that silent sight
"Release me from the pain"
I hope to see the light
So boldly I fought
Battle turns to night
In between I'm caught
(chorus)
If you see me coming
You see death walking
If you see me coming
Get away if you can
First me then there's God
Pray me to be free
To a lake I'll spill your blood
I'm coming and hell is coming with me
(chorus)
Get away, get away if you can
If you sec me coming
Get away, if you sec me coming
You see death, death walkingYou might also likeEmbed
