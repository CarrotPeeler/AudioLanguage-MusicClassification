1 ContributorBad Girl Blues LyricsThese women lovin' each other
Y'all know they ain't thinkin' about no man
These women lovin' each other
Y'all know they ain't thinkin' about no man
They ain't playin' no secrets, oh no
These women playin' a wide open hand
You know I loved a little girl the other day
And I asked her for a little thrill
She said, "I'm so sorry daddy
"I'm putting out the same thing ???"
These women lovin' each other
Y'all know they ain't thinkin' about no man
They ain't playin' no secrets, oh no
They playin' a wide open hand
If you ever take a women out to ride
Bought her all kinda whiskey and wine
She'd say you was too drunk to realise
And I'll see you some other time
You know she was, she was lovin' another
And they wasn't thinkin' about no man
Well, these women ain't playin' no secret, oh no
They playin' a wide open hand
Yes, wide open
You might also likeYou never wanna ??? last night's cookin'
Smellin' sweet like a rose
She come home five o'clock in the mornin' with that
Fish scent all in her clothes
These women lovin' each other
You know they ain't thinkin' about no man
These women ain't playin' no secrets, no more
They playin' a wide open hand
Lovin' each otherEmbed
