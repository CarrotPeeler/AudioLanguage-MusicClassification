2 ContributorsKinda Girl For Me Lyrics"Kinda Girl For Me"

You are everything
You are everything
All of this time
That you been waiting
Seems like now you got what you want (ohh)
You got me stuck on the realness (realness, realness)
Give all your love all your realness

She's that kinda girl
Pretty 'bout 5"6', small hips, with them cinnamon curls
Yes a straight bravado girl
Money for new whips, makin' trips all around the world
Yes she's the kinda girl, always thinkin' on her feet
The type of girl that one day you'd like to meet
Guess I found her, wanna be around her
Really ain't that hard for me to see (yeah)

The truth is see I got it bad
But there ain't nothing wrong with that
Found a girl that makes me wanna go
Places I ain't never been before
She's so sick like a dope melody sittin' nicely on top of the beat
'Cos she's a rider not a fighter, kinda girl for me (yeah)
