2 ContributorsProdigal Son LyricsShine on, prodigal son
Gotta have your morning glory
Keep on having your fun
It'll be the same old story soon
Soon it will be afternoon
Sun getting hot as a fine
Never mind
Keep on watching the sky
Keep on waiting to die
Keep on wondering why
Afternoon
Afternoon
Burn on, celestial star
Burn away the times that find you
Move on wherever you are
Xxx do the thing that one will find you here
You won't have nothing to fear
But time slipping away
Day by day
Keep on watching the sky
Keep on waiting to die
Keep on wondering why
Afternoon

Rushed off to your happy ending

No use wasting time pretending now
Now that you xxxx xxxx xxx
Hating the time and the space?
Lose that race
Keep on watching the sky
Keep on waiting to die
Keep on wondering why
Afternoon
