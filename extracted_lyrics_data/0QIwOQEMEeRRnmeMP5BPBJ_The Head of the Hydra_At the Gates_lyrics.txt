Language, self-destruction
Against the iron air
In broken, nonverbal strains
An all-devouring sand

The phantasm
We invoke
A monument
A final stand

We disappear
The words from our bodies torn
Irresistible
In all its bewildering forms

Deceptive, the images burn
Fragments of silent lives
Hunger of the dreaming dead
Imagination, the death of man

The phantasm
We invoke
A monument
A final stand
You might also like
In blasphemy
The words from our bodies torn
Temptation
Death in all its bewildering forms

The tomb is the passage
As the light flickers before me
The head of the Hydra
The charlatan denounced


We disappear
The words from our bodies torn
Irresistible
In all its bewildering forms
