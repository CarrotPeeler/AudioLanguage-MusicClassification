From vast nights consumed
In sheets and skin
I know the windows when they're closed
The blinds when they're unrolled
For no light gets in
It shows in the distance you grow
The sorrow you show
And when it shows
It shows in the mirrors you see
In dreams that cannot be
Wide awake
It shows in a stranger you saw
A face from afar
You thought you knew
It shows in the distance you grow
The sorrow you show
And when it showsYou might also likeEmbed
