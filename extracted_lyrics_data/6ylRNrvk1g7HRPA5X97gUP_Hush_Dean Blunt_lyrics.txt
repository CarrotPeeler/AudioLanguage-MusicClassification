19 ContributorsHUSH Lyrics
Girl, you really had a lot
Shop? A nigga don't shot
You girls want cotch?
Cause your batty's so hot
Smile, I known you for a while
But I haven't seen you in a while
Gonna leave in a while
So come over for a while
Girl, I haven't seen you in a minute
What a minute
Girl, gonna see you when I leave
Know you wanna leave with a G
To all the niggas that knew me
Sue meYou might also likeEmbed
