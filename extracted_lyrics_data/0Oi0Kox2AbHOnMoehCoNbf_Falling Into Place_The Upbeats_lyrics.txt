1 ContributorSweet Side Lyrics
(Stab me in the back)
(Mh, mh, mh, mh)
(All from best)
(From the west)

All from best, stab me in the back
Full of distress, is it love, is it less
And I'm lookin' for a bless from the west to the east
I'm makin' my way from the loss to the sweet life
All for the best, put me on a rack
Pull on those strings 'til I fall to the black
And I took in all the stress that I got from the peeps
I'm waiting no more, cuz I'm down for the sweet side

Imma stick with the sweet side girl
Tryna send me into that place somehow
I let her be the one, I pray for 'til I'm done
I stay for 'til I'm numb, they say 'upbeat'
Darling imagine our honest talkin'
Forget about time and begin our thing
Bless, but still there's an empty hole
So where can I find you

All from best, stab me in the back
Full of distress, is it love, is it less
And I'm lookin' for a bless from the west to the east
I'm makin' my way from the loss to the sweet life
All for the best, put me on a rack
Pull on those strings 'til I fall to the black
And I took in all the stress that I got from the peeps
I'm waiting no more, cuz I'm down for the sweet side

I'm dancin' with my shawty in the backyard
Shawty in the back 'til I'm awake, yah
I'm chancin' 'til I'm tardy for the flashcards
Tardy for the friends and all the rest
I've been going this road for too long
And I'm tired of being alone
Falling in love just to see they're moving on
Let's still be friends but I'm already gone

All from best, stab me in the back
Full of distress, is it love, is it less
And I'm lookin' for a bless from the west to the east
I'm makin' my way from the loss to the sweet life
All for the best, put me on a rack
Pull on those strings 'til I fall to the black
And I took in all the stress that I got from the peeps
I'm waiting no more, cuz I'm down for the sweet sideEmbed
