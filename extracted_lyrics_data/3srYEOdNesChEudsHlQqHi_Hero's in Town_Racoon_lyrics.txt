You read about it in the paper
You hear about it on the news
The hero's in town
You never know who called him
And there's nothing you can do
The hero's in town
Flying overhead
And he's fixing things as new
The hero's in town
People worship on a daily basis
Before dinner in the afternoon
The hero's in town
Yeah the hero's in town
Sure come in handy
A hero in town
He's offering candy to everyone
Oh what a guy
You better sleep with a gun
The hero is in town
So look up at the sky my friend
Is it safe enough to go out there
The hero's in town
So should we trust or loathe him
Should we break or take his hand
The hero's in town
He's leaning on his golden cane
He gives away free hurricanes
The hero's in town
For god and money devil's fight
Religion holds a beast inside
The hero's in town
Yeah The hero's in town

A hero in town
He's offering candy to everyone
What good are heroes in this mixed up world
Load us up another free, free world
Free world
Load us up another free, free world
Free world
Monkey see, monkey do
Monkey wants so it comes straight through
Small talk travels quicker
Than the truth can tie its shoes
Sure come in handy
A hero in town
He's offering candy to everyone
Oh what a guy
You better sleep with a gun
'Cause the hero is in for money
He's in for money1Embed
