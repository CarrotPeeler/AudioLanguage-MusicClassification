4 ContributorsWhy Sheâ€™s Acting This Way (Our Mother the Mountain Version) Lyrics
Like silence, she stands, like laughter, she falls
From a castle of sand, like a memory, she calls
And the mockingbirds grieve 'cause they can't make her cry
They'll soon start to believe that the lady has died
Oh what it all goes to show it ain't my job to say
For who am I to know why she's actin' this way

Oh once again turn away, if you're sure that it's done
Tell your prophets to pray, tell your bandits to run
Take your eyelids of stone, they won't do you no harm
And take your cross made of bones, take your flypaper arms
And when everything's placed in your coffin of gold
Throw a scarf round your face 'cause the subway gets cold

Pack up your sunflower smile and your bandana blues
Take your worthless denials, they're all you've got left to lose
Take your Tinker Bell lies and your weary desires
Take the tears in your eyes, take your cup full of fire
Ah give your lover a call, if your legs start to fail
And he'll come break your fall with a bed full of nails

No need to glance back again, there ain't nothin' to see
Just this drunken old man and this woman and me
And you've made it quite plain that we're just wastin' time
And you say it seems strange that I'm staying behind
But don't you worry 'bout me, I can make it alone
'Cause I got no place to be and I ain't far from homeYou might also likeEmbed
