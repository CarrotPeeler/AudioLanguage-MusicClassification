Smoking, drinking, never thinking of tomorrow, nonchalant
Diamonds shining, dancing, dining
With some man in a restaurant
Is that all you really want? No no, no no
Sophisticated lady, I know
You miss the love you lost long ago
And when nobody is nigh, you cry

They say into your early life romance came
And in this heart of yours burned a flame
A flame that flickered one day and died away
And then, with disillusion deep in your eyes
You learned that fools in love soon grow wise
The years have changed you somehow
I see you now

Smoking, drinking, never thinking of tomorrow, nonchalant
Diamonds shining, dancing, dining
With some man in a restaurant
Is that all you really want? No no, no no
Sophisticated lady, I know
You miss the love you lost long ago
And when somebody is nigh, you cry, you cry, you cryYou might also likeEmbed
