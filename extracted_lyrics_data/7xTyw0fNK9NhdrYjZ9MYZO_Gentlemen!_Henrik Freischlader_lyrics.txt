1 ContributorGentlemen! LyricsI feel bad for you
Way too many things that you gotta do
But this new kind of man fail to play
The part of your helping hand
That's why we miss all your love
Just puttin' dispensable things above
It's a shame what it became
And we're the ones to blame
Yeah
We can't care for you
And there ain't no way
You wouldn't tell another truth
But we should do everything
That would make you happy
As early as you are satisfied
We won't get a chance
To make a wrong right
We need this flow from years ago
And yeah, you know I know
Yeah
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
You miss the love of the gentlеman
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
You miss the love of the gеntleman
I know, I know, I know
Yes, you wanna take it slow with me
You might also likeSo keep walking through the garden
And put flowers in your hair
Going miles just to save your hand
Your feet just wouldn't care
Spending nights to feel the same
Wasting days sharing dreams
And you wouldn't need nobody
Your fable's got so many scenes
So don't close your eyes
Help yourself to realize, yeah
Just what you need and what you want
And you will find just who you'll get it from
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
You miss the love of the gentleman
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
You miss the love of the gentleman
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
You miss the love of the gentleman
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
You miss the love of the gentleman
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
You miss the love of the gentleman
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
You miss the love of the gentleman
I know, I know
Yes, you wanna take it slow with meEmbed
