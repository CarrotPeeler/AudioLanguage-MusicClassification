All the animals
Agree you and me
Should be a team

And they walk on parade
Say that we were made
To be a team

And my heart flutters when you're near
Oh, longing to hear you call me dear

And all the rainbows
Say that they know
We're a perfect pair

And the clouds up in the sky
Say they can see it from way up high
We're a perfect pair

And my ways weaken beneath your will
And before you I am trembling and still
You might also like
All the birds know it
One and one is two
All the birds see it
Tell me, why don't you?

And all the light of the sun
Doesn't help me out none
'Cause you still can't see meEmbed
