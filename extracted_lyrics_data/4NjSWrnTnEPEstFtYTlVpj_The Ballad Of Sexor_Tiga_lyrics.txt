Some say Sexor was a man
Tight pants, black hair and a tan
If so, I just don't understand
How he could come and go
And some say Sexor was a prince
And he could take your love with his fingertips
And if so, I just don't understand
Why he wore those kid gloves on his hands

Whatever I gain, whatever I lose
I will stay the same, my promise to you
First hand man and take me by the hand
It's so easy once you understand

Some say Sexor was a girl
A mischief smile to rule the world
And if so, I just don't understand
How everything's going just as I planned
And some say Sexor was a dream
In the mind of a million men
And if so, I just don't understand
Why all my dreams come true
You might also like
Whatever I gain, whatever I lose
I will stay the same, my promise to you
First hand man and take me by the hand
It's so easy once you understand

Whatever I gain (Whatever I gain), whatever I lose (Whatever I lose)
I will stay the same (I will stay the same), my promise to you (My promise to you)
First hand man (First hand man), and take me by the hand (And take me by the hand)
It's so easy (So easy) once you understand (Once you understand)Embed
