1 ContributorConvergence Of Hurting Lyrics
You were the runt, went to school and they beat you bad
Taken out of school to no longer experience that
Now I know your mom and dad are not the smartest
Did they have a hands-off approach to class when they taught it?
In home school and one of your brothers hurt you mentally
Just one of the things that affected you detrimentally
Verbally abused so you found some refuge in food, video games
Bile backed up, gall bladder removed
Little love, back in public school high senior year
You’d cling to anyone and everyone who’d lend you an ear
Is that fear?

I wonder why the convergence of so much pain had to happen to you like a perfect storm in the rain
But I understand why you’re still confused to this day
It’s not all your fault, it’s just that you were raised this way

Made a lot of friends that senior year of high school, darling
Followed them to college but you’re not a scholar
You stopped with your small degree
You’d work, drink, smoke, party to death and
I know your story’s deep, sex was just a tool for acceptance
Relationships died ‘cause healthy bonds were not manifested
Sexing like a jackrabbit, lack of hats on your fellas
Even screwed a bunch of dames ‘cause the men were not better
They left ya, but who the hell’s fault is that?
You put no value on the most sacred treasure you have, your vag
And your mind you give it away to the trends
You laugh and think it’s okay and play with your friends
Watch out ‘cause these demons have come back to haunt ya
Find the fighter in you, I won’t be there when they stalk ya
You might also like
I wonder why the convergence of so much pain had to happen to you like a perfect storm in the rain
But I understand why you’re still confused to this day
It’s not all your fault, it’s just that you were raised this way

Even children get older, and of course you’re getting older too
How’s that guy you cheated on? Can he still get a hold of you?
A house condemned is not easy to remove from sin
The dirt from your teens and early twenties moved back in
You don’t sweep it
Do you still sneak behind the backs of men?
Do you think feminist ideology’s an attack on men?
At any rate, here we are at your present job, just a job
Trying to steady date with guys but it’s hard
You scare them all away because you’re still wild, juvenile and a child
You give promiscuity a wink and a smile, that’s vile
And you got to me, but you haven’t changed
So the same result came, we’re no longer a thang
Finish your new degree, girl, but also fix up your morals
You have egg on your face, wipe it off before it’s all over

I wonder why the convergence of so much pain had to happen to you like a perfect storm in the rain
But I understand why you’re still confused to this day
It’s not all your fault, it’s just that you were raised this wayEmbed
