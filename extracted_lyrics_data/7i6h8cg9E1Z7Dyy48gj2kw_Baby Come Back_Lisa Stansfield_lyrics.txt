3 ContributorsBaby Come Back LyricsSpending all my nights
All my money going out of the town
Doing anything just to get you off of my mind
But when the morning comes
And I"m back where I started again
Trying to forget you is just a waste of time
Baby come back
Any kind of fool could see
There was something in everything about you
Baby come back
You can blame it all on me
I was wrong and I just can't live without you
All day long wearing a mask of false bravado
Trying to keep up a smile that hides a tear
But as the sun goes down I get that empty feeling again
How I wish to God that you were here
Baby come back
Any kind of fool could see
There was something in everything about you
Baby come back
You can blame it all on me
I was wrong and I just can't live without you
You might also likeNow that I've pulled it up all together
Give me the chance to make you see
Have you used up all the love in your heart
Is there nothing left for me, is there nothing left for me
Baby come back
Any kind of fool could see
There was something in everything about you
Baby come back
You can blame it all on me
I was wrong and I just can't live without youEmbed
