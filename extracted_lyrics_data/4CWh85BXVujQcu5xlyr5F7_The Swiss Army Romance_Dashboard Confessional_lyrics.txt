8 ContributorsThe Swiss Army Romance LyricsSleep with all the lights on
You're not so happy
You're not secure
You're dying to look cute in your blue jeans
But you're plastic just like everyone
Just like everyone
And that face you paint is pressed
Impressing most of us as permanent
And I'd like to see you undone
College night will draw the crowds
Dorms unload and you're heading out
Here is your moment to shine
Making up a history
It’s nothing from the life you lead
But man, will they buy all your lines
Sleep with all the sheets off
Baring your mattress, baring your soul
And you're dying to look smooth with your tattoos
But you're searching just like everyone
You could be anyone
And those friends you have are the best
Impressing most of us as permanent
And I'd like to see you undone
You might also likeYouth's the most unfaithful mistress
Still we forge ahead to miss her
Rushing our moment to shine
Making up a history
It’s nothing from the life you lead
But man, will they buy all your lines
We're not twenty-one
But the sooner we are, the sooner the fun will begin
So get out your fake eyelashes and fake I.D's and real disasters ensue
It's cool to take these chances
It's cool to fake romances
And grow up fastEmbed
