Mr. Joy, Mr. Joy's a toy
You can wind him up
He'll do anything you want him to
He'll sing and dance and make everybody happy
Mr. Joy, Mr. Joy

Buying a toy, a passion I need so badly
He's my Mr. Joy, he's waiting for me so gladly
I'll wind him and when I'm alone, feeling sadly
Come to my bed, say "Don't you feel so badly?"

Mr. Joy, he's my favorite toy
You can wind him up, you can wind him up
And he'll do anything you want him to
Mr. Joy, oh my Mr. Joy
My favorite toy, my Mr. Joy

Buying a toy, a passion I need so badly
He's my Mr. Joy, waiting for me so gladly
I'll wind him and when I'm alone, feeling sadly
He'll come to my bed and say "Don't you feel so badly?"

Mr. Joy, Mr. Joy
He's my favorite toy
Oh, you can wind him up, you can a-wind him up
And he'll do anything you want him to
My Mr. Joy
My Mr. Joy, joy, joy, joy, joy
He's my favorite toy, oh, oh, oh, oh
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, oy, oh, oh, oy
He's my favorite toy, my Mr. JoyEmbed
