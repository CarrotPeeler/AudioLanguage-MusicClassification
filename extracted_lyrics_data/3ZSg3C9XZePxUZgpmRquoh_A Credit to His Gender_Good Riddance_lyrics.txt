2 ContributorsA Credit to His Gender LyricsHow are you feeling?
How does someone like you elude the moral quarantine
Does your repression only server the greater lie
As you abuse and objectify
All the emotions you defeat you've got the world at your feet
Because you think you've silenced all the critics of your misogynistic lies
But when you wake up from your reveries you'd better realize
You're a model of virility a specimen divine
As you deflower you empower the false ego trapped inside
And by the virtue of your "conquests" you've endeared yourself
To those who you hold in high esteem
You think you've silenced all the critics of your misogynistic lies
But when you wake up from your reveries you'd better realize
You've got to rectify
That attitude
You're a hopeless case
And now you're too late
You call her a whore
She's just the same as you
Though she could never be that shallow
But you just take what you can get
And you throw the rest away
Another notch in your belt
Another score another lay
You might also likeYou're taking
She's giving
You're losing
You think you're winning
You're time is
Running out now
It doesn't feel the same3Embed
