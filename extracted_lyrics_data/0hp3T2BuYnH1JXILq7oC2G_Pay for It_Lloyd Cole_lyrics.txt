2 ContributorsPay for It LyricsStrange to see you babe, ain't nothing down here free
Did you lose your ticket? hope you weren't looking for me
I'm still wearing the scars I got from being your fool
You messed me up pretty good babe I didn't mean to ruin you
I remember when I first saw you babe you were looking pretty good
You said you were looking for love, well then why didn't you?
You just sat there taking everything you could get
Never thought one day you might have to pay for it
Did you ever dream baby one day you might fall
And feel your back against the wall?
Did you ever dream baby one day you might crawl
Did you ever dream?
Now when you're putting on your face I guess that you feel kind of low
Knowing that you past your best and you've got nothing to show
Well, baby, you know just as well as I some fool is going to fall your way
Only this time around you might have to pay for it
Did you ever dream baby one day you might fall
And feel your back against the wall?
Did you ever dream baby one day you might crawl?
Did you ever dream, baby?
When you had no need, baby
Did you ever dream
That you might have to
