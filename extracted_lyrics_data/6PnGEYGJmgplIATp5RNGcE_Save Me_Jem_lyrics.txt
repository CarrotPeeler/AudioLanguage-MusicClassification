5 ContributorsSave Me Lyrics
Save me
Save me
Save me, oh

I've gotta stop my mind
Working overtime
It's driving me insane, aha, aha
It will not let me live
Always so negative
It's become my enemy, aha, aha

Save me (Ah, ah)
Save me (Ah, ah)
Save me (Ah), oh
Save me (Ah, ah)
Save me (Ah, ah)
Save me (Ah), oh

Why would I think such things
Crazy thoughts have quick wings
Gaining momentum fast, aha, aha
One minute I am fine
The next I've lost my mind
To a fake fantasy, aha, aha
You might also like
And none of these thoughts are real
So why is it that I feel
So cut up and so bad
I need to take control
'Cause my mind is on a roll
And it isn't listening to me

Save me (Thinking, thinking)
Save me (Thinking, thinking)
Save me (Thinking, thinking), oh
Save me (Thinking, thinking)
Save me (Thinking, thinking)
Save me (Thinking, thinking), oh

Mirror mirror on the wall
Who's the dumbest of them all
Insecurities keep growing
Wasted energies are flowing
Anger, pain and sadness beckon
Panic sets in, in a second
Be aware it's just your mind
And you can stop it anytime
Save me (Thinking, thinking)
Save me (Thinking, thinking)
Save me (Thinking, thinking), oh
Save me (Thinking, thinking)
Save me (Thinking, thinking)
Save me (Thinking, thinking), oh

OK so here we go
If it works I'll let you know
One, two, three I say stopEmbed
