4 ContributorsTrailer Park Mullet Wars Lyrics
I'm now going to beat you 36 times....
I wish I was cool as you, I wish I was cool as you
I wish I was cool as you, I wish I was cool as you

War, war, war, war, war, war, war, war
Bring it, bring it, bring it, war
Bring it, bring it, bring it, war
Bring it, bring it, bring it, war (Eye for an eye)
Bring it, bring it, bring it, war (Tooth for a tooth)
Bring it, bring it, bring it, war (Eye for an eye)
Bring it, bring it, bring it, war (Tooth for a tooth)

Can't escape from a criminal mind
Eat that biscuit and walk that line
A cop on a donut don't need a gun
Some people think that crime is fun
Billy Ray Cyrus got a mullet on
Trans Am parked in a trailer zone
Shoot that man when I'm out of town
Maggots take the body now

War, war, war, war, war, war, war, war
Bring it, bring it, bring it, war
Bring it, bring it, bring it, war
Bring it, bring it, bring it, war (Eye for an eye)
Bring it, bring it, bring it, war (Tooth for a tooth)
Bring it, bring it, bring it, war (Eye for an eye)
Bring it, bring it, bring it, war (Tooth for a tooth)

Big black woman with her weave on tight
Bust that lip in a cowboy fight
Shake that tooth in a rotten fruit
Sex in the morning in the birthday suit
Stick your eye with a big horsefly
Crush your mind and you don't know why
Early bird did get that worm
You never listen you never learn

War, war, war, war, war, war, war, war
Bring it, bring it, bring it, war
Bring it, bring it, bring it, war
Bring it, bring it, bring it, war (Eye for an eye)
Bring it, bring it, bring it, war (Tooth for a tooth)
Bring it, bring it, bring it, war (Eye for an eye)
Bring it, bring it, bring it, war (Tooth for a tooth)Embed
