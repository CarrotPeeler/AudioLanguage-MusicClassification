3 ContributorsWhat Was I Thinking? LyricsWhy do we torture ourselves?
This will never work I can already tell
We're not the same, it's over
What exactly would you like me to do?
Whitewash my words to hide the truth
Make them easier to swallow
It's not gonna happen
As entertaining as this has been
Stuck in romantic destruction
It's all a mistake and it's all I can take
What was I thinking?
Maybe I wasn't at all
Where were we headed
Before we dropped the ball?
You're at the bar having a ball
I'm staring at my f*ckin' hotel wall
Driven half insane with no diversions
How much will I take before I break?
I've taken the liberty in deciding your fate
Now the damage is done
In a time of great tribulation
I forgot my shovel at your grave
I'll need it back in case anyone else misbehaves
A higher power told me we can't be saved
What was I thinking?
Maybe I wasn't at all
Where were we headed
Before we dropped the ball?
What were you doing
Inside the bathroom stall?
What was I thinking?
Maybe I wasn't at all
Didn't I say, didn't I say, didn't I say I'd call?
Didn't I say, didn't I say, didn't I say I'd call?
I've been climbing up, I've been climbing up
I've been climbing the walls
I've been climbing up, I've been climbing up
I've been climbing the wallsYou might also likeEmbed
