Sunrise, wrong side of another day
Sky high and six thousand miles away
Don't know how long I've been awake
Wound up in an amazing state

Can't get enough
And you know it's the righteous stuff
Goes up like prices at Christmas

Motörhead, remember me now
Motörhead, alright

Brain dead, total amnesia
Get some mental anesthesia
Don't move, I'll shut the door and kill the lights
I guess I'll see you all on the ice

All good clean fun
Have another stick of gum
Man, you look better already
You might also like
Motörhead, remember me now
Motörhead, alright

Bam, bam, bam, bam, bam! Ow, ow!


Fourth day, five day marathon
We're moving like a parallelogram
Don't move, I'll shut the door and kill the lights
I guess I'll see you all on the ice

I should be tired
And all I am is wired
Ain't felt this good for an hour

Motörhead, remember me now
Motörhead, alright
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Motörhead, remember me now
Motörhead, it's only you now
Motörhead, only you, babe
Motörhead, yeah, yeah, yeah3Embed
