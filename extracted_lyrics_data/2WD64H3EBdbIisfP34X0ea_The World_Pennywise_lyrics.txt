4 ContributorsThe World LyricsHatred from your closed mind nothing you think is gonna change
Your actions speak so loud you've got to try a different way
We live together we're worlds apart down on the streets
Because we're too proud no one will ever admit defeat
The world is a smoking gun and it's loaded
And soon it's gonna blow you away
Up till now nobody has noticed
But we're going to have our day
Where do we draw the line nobody seems to have clue
We're at each other's throats cause we don't share a point of view
So what's the problem can't see beneath the shade of skin
A vicious circle a human race no one can win
The world is a smoking gun and it's loaded
And soon it's gonna blow you away
Up till now nobody has noticed
But we're going to have our day
It's just a state of mind it's not reality
It's all psychosomatic static inhumanity
A savage mental sickness that plagues the human race And it's going to blow up in your face
The world is a smoking gun and it's loaded
And soon it's gonna blow you away
Up till now nobody has noticed
But we're going to have our day

And soon it's gonna blow you away
Up till now nobody has noticed
But we're going to have our dayEmbed
