Sweet Leilani
Heavenly flower
Nature fashioned roses kissed with dew
And then she placed them in a bower
It was the start of you
Sweet Leilani
Heavenly flower
I dreamed of paradise for two
You are my paradise completed
You are my dream come true

I dreamed of paradise for two
You are my paradise completed
