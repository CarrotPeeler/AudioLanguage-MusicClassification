4 ContributorsMissing You Lyrics
I wish this could be
A happy song
But my happiness disappeared
The moment you were gone
Don't think I ever believed that
This day will come
Now all I'm feeling
Is lost and numb

And oh, I know I promised
Mmm, that I will try

But I, yes I miss you
And it's killing inside

I'll always be thankful
For the time we had
We were blessed I should celebrate
But I feel too sad
Our wonderful memories
Just make me fall apart
And it feels like somebody
Stepping in my heart
You might also like
No, I know I promised
Mmm, that I wouldn't cry

But I, yes I miss you
And it's killing inside, oh
Well I, yes I miss you
Want you by my side

Walking, holding hands
Talking making plans
Touching my heart, my soul

I wish this could be
A happy song
But my happiness disappeared
The moment you were gone
Tell me it's not happening
Say it's not as it seems
Tell me that I'm gonna wake up
It's just a bad dream

Please tell me that it's fiction
Tell me it's just a lie
Whatever you choose to tell me
Please say you didn't die
Yes I, yes I miss you
And it's killing inside, oh
Well I, yes I, I miss you
Want you by my side

Oh, well I, oh I miss you
Want you by my side
Back here by my side
Here by my sideEmbed
