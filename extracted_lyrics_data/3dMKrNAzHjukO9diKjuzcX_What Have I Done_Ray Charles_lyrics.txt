2 ContributorsWhat Have I Done Lyrics
Tell me Baby
Tell me the truth
Tell me Honey, what are you going to do?
Tell me Babe, please tell me
What have I done?

I took you in
Right off the block
You would be that ragged
Head a mop

Tell me babe
Please, please tell me
What have I done?

If you don't want me, why don't you tell me so?
How could someone else, have let you go?
Won't you tell me, please, baby please tell me
What have I done?You might also likeEmbed
