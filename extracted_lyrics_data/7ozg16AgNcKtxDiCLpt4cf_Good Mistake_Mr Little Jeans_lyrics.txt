5 ContributorsGood Mistake Lyrics
Blood on your hands and your hands still roam
But your secret is safe with the garden gnome
Those marks on your neck never seem to fade
Bring a marching band for the masquerade
Oh lonely man
You know you can
A pocket knife
Will serve you well
Remember what you're good for
There's much more to life

Ooooh
Under the sun
Ooooh
It's not what they can see
Ooooh
Until it's done
Oooooh
Your secret's safe with me

Blow out the candles on your cake
It's another year due with the same mistakes
Blind like a bat when you hit that wall
Now who's gonna come who you gonna call
Oh lonely man
You know you can
A pocket knife
Will serve you well
Remember what you're good for
There's much more to life
You might also like
Ooooh
Under the sun
Ooooh
It's not what they can see
Ooooh
Until it's done
Oooooh
Your secret's safe with me

I can see you run
I can see you're undone
Shadow to the sun
Shadow to the sun
See a rule to break
See another rule to make
It's a good mistake
Shadow next to none

Ooooh
Under the sun
Ooooh
It's not what they can see
Ooooh
Until it's done
Oooooh
Your secret's safe with me
Ooooh
Under the sun
Ooooh
It's not what they can see
Ooooh
Until it's done
Oooooh
Your secret's safe with me
(Ooooh) Broken bones in the walking man
Under the sun
It's a trick to the eye, It's a rubber band
It's not what they can see
Don't let it go, Let it fall appart
Until it's done
It's heavy load, For a tender heart
Your secret's safe with me
Broken bones in a walking man
Under the sun
It's a trick to the eye
It's a rubber band
It's not what they can see
Don't let it go
Let it fall a part
Until it's done
It's a heavy load
For a tender heart
Your secret's safe with me3Embed
