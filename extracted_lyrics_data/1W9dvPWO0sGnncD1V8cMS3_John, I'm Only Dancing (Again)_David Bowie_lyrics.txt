11 ContributorsJohn, Iâ€™m Only Dancing (Again) Lyrics
(Dancing) I'm having so much love
(Dancing) Too bad my back had gone
(Dancing) Boogie down with David now
I'd give my house in the country, if you'd slept, it's so funky

(Music) I'm dancing in the street
(Ooh, music) I've torn the shoes from my feet
(Romancing) It's got me dirty and sweet
It's got you reeling and rocking, won't you let the slender thing in?

(Rolling) I think it's all I can do
(Rolling) Just got me feeling you too
(Ooh, rolling) Give a little, take a little, give a little back
Jumping John, the great goose is gone
Got a lion in my hand, a Charlie on my back

(John) I'm only dancing
(She turns me on) I'm only dancing
(She turns me on) Ooh, get you with me
(Don't get me wrong) Ah ha ha ha ha
(I'm only dancing, hmm)
(I'm only dancing, hmm)
You might also like
(Dancing) have you heard the news?
(Dancing) President has got the blues
(Dancing) I tell you comfortably
If he gives it to you, he'd better take it from me

(Sad sir) I pick up your bones
(Sad sir) Leave the numbers alone
(Sad sir) Get off your telephones
Look the people in the eye, tell them my oh my
Let your backbone slide, buddy whistle and cry

(John)
(She turns me on)
(She turns me on) La da la le la
(Don't get me wrong) Mmm hmm hmm
(I'm only dancing, hmm)
(I'm only dancing, hmm)
(John) I'm only dancing
(She turns me on) I'm only dancing
(She turns me on) I lost my fear
(Don't get me wrong) And I'm on my war
(I'm only dancing, hmm) Please dance with me
(I'm only dancing, hmm) Please dance with me
(I'm only dancing, hmm)
(Dancing, dancing, dancing, woo woo woo)
(Dancing, dancing, dancing, woo woo woo)
(Dancing, dancing, dancing, woo woo woo)
(Dancing) I'm only dancing (Dancing), I'm only dancing
(Dancing) I'm only (Woo woo woo)
(Dancing) I'm only dancing (Dancing), I'm only dancing
(Dancing) I'm only (Woo woo woo)
Can't see nor hear, I lost my beer
Cha-Charlie dance on (Woo woo woo)
(Woo woo woo)
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, 'cause (Woo woo woo)
Got white light, got black light
Got white light, lay your dance on (Woo woo woo)
I'm only, I'm only, I'm only (Woo woo woo)
I got, I got (Woo woo woo)
(Woo woo woo)
(Dancing) hey (Dancing), hey
(Dancing) hey (Woo woo woo)
Lay your dance on me
(Dancing) Lay your dance on me
(Dancing) Lay your dance on me, hey
(Woo woo woo)
(Dancing, dancing, dancing, woo woo woo) Gotta give me know
(Dancing) Gotta give me know (Dancing), Gotta give me know
(Dancing, woo woo woo)
(Dancing) hey, hey (Dancing), hey, hey
(Dancing, woo woo woo)
Lockin' it fine, makin' it mine
Lockin' it fine, makin' it mine
Lockin' it fine, making it!
