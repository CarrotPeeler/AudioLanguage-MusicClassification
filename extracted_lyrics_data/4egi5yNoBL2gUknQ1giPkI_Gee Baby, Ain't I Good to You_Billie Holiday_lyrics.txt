8 ContributorsGee Baby, Ainâ€™t I Good to You LyricsLord makes me treat you the way I do
Gee baby, ain't I good to you?
There's nothing in the world too good for a girl that's good for true
Gee baby, ain't I good to you?
Bought you a for coat for Christmas, a diamond ring
A Cadillac car, and everything
Lord makes me treat you the way that I do
Gee baby, ain't I good to you?You might also likeEmbed
