2 ContributorsGoldfish Bowl Lyrics
What will it take for them to leave me alone?
Don't they know I'm just a guy who sings songs?
I'm not promoting no hit record
And I don't have no TV show
And I don't have no reason to live in the goldfish bowl

I'm just doing my gigs and I'm on and off the road
Everything I say is not meant to be set in stone
Just because they call me a celebrity
That does not make it true
'Cause I don't believe in the myth, people, so why should you?

Jazz, blues and funk
That's not rock and roll
Folk with a beat
And little bit of soul
I don't have no hit record
I don't have no TV show
Tell me why should I have to live in this goldfish bowl?


Well, there's parasites and psychic vampires feeding on the public at large
Projecting their shadow onto everyone else
Well, the newspaper barons
Are scum of the lowest degree
And they prey on everybody, they prey on you and me
You might also like
I'm singing jazz, blues and funk
Baby, that's not rock and roll
And folk with a beat
And a little bit of soul
I don't have no hit record
I don't have no TV show
So why should I want to live in this goldfish bowl?


So why should I have to live in this goldfish bowl?Embed
