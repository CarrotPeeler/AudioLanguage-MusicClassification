2 ContributorsHow Can You Do It? Lyrics
Well, you take my money, you call it chicken feed
You take my money and you throw it around

Baby, how can you do it?
Baby, how can you do it?
Baby, how can you do it, throw my money around?

Well, I work hard every day as a man 'sposed to do
Take my money, bring it home to you

Baby, how can you do it?
Baby, how can you do it?
Baby, how can you do it, throw my money around?

I done told you once, I ain't gon' tell you no more
Next time I tell ya, got to let you down

Baby, how can you do it?
Baby, how can you do it?
Baby, how can you do it, throw my money around?
Yes, yes

Baby, how can you do it?
Baby, how can you do it?
Baby, how can you do it, throw my money around?
Baby, how can you do it?
Baby, how can you do it?
Baby, how can you do it, throw my money around?

Well, you take my money, you call it chicken feed
You take my money and you throw it around

Baby, how can you do it?
Baby, how can you do it?
Baby, how can you do it, throw my money around?Embed
