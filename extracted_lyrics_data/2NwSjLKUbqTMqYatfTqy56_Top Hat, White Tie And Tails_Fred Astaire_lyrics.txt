"Your presence requested this evening
It's formal, a top hat, a white tie and tails."
Nothing now could take the wind out of my sails
Because I'm invited to step out this evening
With top hat and white tie and tails

For I'll be there
Puttin' down my top hat
Mussin' up my white tie
Dancin' in my tails
I'm puttin' on my top hat
Tyin' up my white tie
Brushin' off my tails
I'm dudin' up my shirt front
Puttin' in the shirt studs
Polishin' my nails
I'm steppin' out, my dear
To breathe an atmosphere
That simply reeks with class;
And I trust that you'll excuse my dust
When I step on the gas
