6 ContributorsWinds Of Destination Lyrics
Blood is flowing on the ground
Like a river branching red lines
Anguish is all around
Hope yielding to (despair)
Life is a circumstance
Any minute slips away
God, please look upon us all
Do you give a damn?!

Dancing in the air
Spinning leaves in circles giving
Pleasure to my eyes
Sadden my delight
When the joy is over laying scattered
On the ground

Oh! The sun will rise
The beginning of creation
Oh! Into the skies
On the winds of destination
Carry us away

Secret ark of Solomon (Solomon)
Hidden in the temple wreck (Temple wreck)
For the king (For the king)
Many years and centuries (Centuries)
'Till seven knights from the order
Down the tunnels of the past (Of the past)
Learning from the undisclosed (Undisclosed)
All the way (All the way)
Holding dreams on zealous hands (Zealous hands)
All those archives
Lost and wasted (Wasted)
Somewhere in the battle fields (Fields)


Farewell to common world
Templars are watching
And guarding the scrolls
Shields of faith the knights behold
All manuscripts of the sacred
Laws are there

Dancing in the air
Spinning leaves in circles
Giving pleasure to my eyes
Arrive!

Oh oh oh oh! The sun will rise
The beginning of creation
Oh oh oh oh! Into the skies
On the winds of destination
Carry us

(Away!)
Old leaves will be falling
Old trees will remain
Old leaves will be falling
Old trees will remain
Whirlwind carries you away
For tomorrow be the sameEmbed
