7 ContributorsUntitled (Love Song) LyricsIf tonight’s the night, then today is my day
That I should hang it all on display
Yours was just a loser's game
And I decided that I should play
Throw your arms around my neck
I won’t be soon to forget
Throw your arms around my neck
I won’t be soon to forget
Felt the wind’s direction beginning to change
Clouds so softly full of rain
The summer fell and the winter sprang
Now it’s all a feeling I can’t get back again
Throw your arms around my neck
I won’t be soon to forget
Throw your arms around my neck
I won’t be soon to forget
Cloudy thoughts against a clear blue sky
When the feeling came, I felt like getting high
With no sense to try to find my peace of mind
‘Cause maybe I was born to win, dissatisfied
Throw your arms around my neck
I won’t be soon to forget
Throw your arms around my neck
I won’t be soon to forget
Throw your arms around my neck
I won’t be soon to forget
Throw your arms around my neck
I won’t be soon to forgetYou might also like3Embed
