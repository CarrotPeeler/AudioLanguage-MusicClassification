When the day is over and the work is done
Well, it's a different story
As the darkness comes around
I tried to let you know
You're going the wrong way

And the streets you thought
Would all be paved with gold
But when the wind cuts through
You'd even try to sell your soul
Everywhere you go, it's the long way

Now you're no longer just the boy next door
When they were falling in love
With that clean-cut smile, change of style
Just for a little while

Whatcha doing? Hey, whatcha doing?
Walking through danger
Can't see the wrong or the right
Whatcha doing? Tell me whatcha doing
Can't be a stranger, must be a trick of the night

Well, its a laugh a minute and you can't decide
Between the burning question
And the fortune in his eyes
You'd never let it show
Or take it the wrong way

Sometimes you wonder what you came here for
Oh, they could tear you apart
With those bare-faced lies, can't disguise
All the hurt you're feeling inside

Whatcha doing? Hey, whatcha doing?
Walking through danger
Can't see the wrong or the right
Whatcha doing? Tell me whatcha doing
Can't be a stranger, must be a trick of the night
Whatcha doing? Hey, whatcha doing?
Walking through danger
Can't see the wrong or the right
Whatcha doing? Tell me whatcha doing
Can't be a stranger, must be a trick of the night

Of the night
Of the night
(Must be a trick of the night)
(A trick of the night)
When the day is over and the work is done
Well, it's a different story
As the darkness comes around
And the streets you thought (Must be a trick)
Would all be paved with gold (Of the night)
But when the wind cuts through
You'd even try to sell your soul (Must be a trick of the night)
When the day is over and the work is done
Well, it's a different story
As the darkness comes around (Can't see the wrong or the right)
And the streets you thought (Whatcha doing?)
Would all be paved with gold (Hey, whatcha doing?)
But when the wind cuts through (Can't be a stranger)
You'd even try to sell your soul (Must be a trick of the night)
When the day is over and the work is done
Well, it's a different story
As the darkness comes around (Can't see the wrong or the right)
And the streets you thought (Whatcha doing?)
Would all be paved with gold (Hey, whatcha doing?)
But when the wind cuts through (Can't be a stranger)
You'd even try to sell your soul (Must be a trick of the night)
When the day is over and the work is done
Well, it's a different story
As the darkness comes around (Can't see the wrong or the right)
And the streets you thought (Whatcha doing?)
Would all be paved with gold (Hey, whatcha doing?)
But when the wind cuts through (Can't be a stranger)
You'd even try to sell your soul (Must be a trick of the night)Embed
