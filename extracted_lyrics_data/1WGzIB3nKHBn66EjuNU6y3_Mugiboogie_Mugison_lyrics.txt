Like I was a fruit hanging in her tree
The way she moves her hips
The way she wets her lips
I love the way that girl is looking at me
I love the way she is looking at me
Those sea green eyes are drowning me
Her smile is more like a dare
Never seen that electric stare
Love the way that woman is looking at me
You can't stop, can't even try
Get around that beat; I can see it in your eye
The way you're tapping your feet
Looking oh so sweet
Say you never dance - you never move
I've seen the way you're tapping to my groove
Girl you're teasing so
Feel like I'm about to explode
Don't make a fool out of me ...You might also likeEmbed
