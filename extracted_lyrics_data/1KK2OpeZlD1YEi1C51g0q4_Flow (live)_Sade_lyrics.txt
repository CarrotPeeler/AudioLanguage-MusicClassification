2 ContributorsMurda Boyz Lyrics
The Illa Ghee
I'm gunning
Let's go
Uh huh
This is how it goes down
It's about to go down
Illa

Hey yo I slip through the cracks
My rap flows crack
My gun create hands when the razors go clap
I spit so hard make the beat catch flack
I never had a deal but yet I got a gold plaque
True dog got to make you fake niggas lay flat
You appetizer cats are not food you're just snacks
I'm not a lead song but I can take it to the max
I spit black milk and I swing the (?) ax
I ran them
Come through your hood with wild handguns
Handsome
Rap so foul I need a  (?)
Illa Ghee fam this is me (?)
Go ham
My gun jelly 'cause haters never want jam
You god-damn right I fuck fans
In hotels, cars, the roof, and broke vans
My rap flow scars and bars are like brands
Fuck a tight jean nigga, the Illa's a grown man
You might also like
Now let the murda boyz play kid
My whole flow murder I live it the same way
And if you don't give I take
Homie I spit in your face, make you open the safe
(x2)

Loud nigga got the nine pointed at your liver
Sip a little liqour, the ice is in the ticker
My chain ice glacier, lyrics beyond nature
Ball like a Laker, enemies better pray for
Taste it
Public enemy with no flavor
It's sad
Like the Ray J fight with (?)
I'm mad, I'm fronting with a forty-four mag
I'm mad, my flow like a Louis V Jag
Models
I do them how they do them in Chicago
Bravo
The Illa Ghee app is for (?)
And I knows
I'll go against all mono-e-mono
Its time yo, running through the jungle like a rhino
You're blind if you don't see the rap games mine
I went to jail
'Cause its a crime I'm not signed
Like the sun I will shine
Like coffee beans in the blender I'm on grind

You can find me in the gun range
Hitting the target with sharp aim
Or sitting in the range and I'm floating in all lanes
A lot of niggas talking but never do what they claim
I'm not the smartest dude but still be getting some brain
My lyrics are rugers (?)
You're loving what you're hearing but lyrics mimic and pain
The street (?) but still be looking the same
I'm the president to Bill (?) babies like Lil' Wayne
My attitude is real fucked up, and real shitty
Sometimes I feel like the bullet that killed Biggie
Life stands ugly but betchu I'll be sitting pretty
With something pretty, hand on the blouse or in the kitty
I know too many killers (?) murder comitting
My lyrics is the day the terrorists hit the city
Enemies got smacked silly
I'm from Bed Stuy but my aura is Guy Richie
