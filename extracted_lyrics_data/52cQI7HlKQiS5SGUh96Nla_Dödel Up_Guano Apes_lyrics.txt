When your cigarette? S lying between your lips
Why do you always need some stars
They just go out to find themselves
Why do we never, ever had
My life is stepping far ahead
Why do we never, ever had
Your life is stepping far ahead, but
Let me be so cool
Yeah, that might be cool
I might be a fool in your eyes
Let me be so cool
Yeah, that might be cool
I might be a fool in your arms
Get it all
Dodel up, dodel up, huh?
Dodel up, dodel up, huh?
Dodel up, dodel up
I like a better prod
Do you really mean all this
See your shiny eyes down in the crowd
Am I really made for this
I think it feels good to be around

I might be a fool in your eyes
In your eyes, in your eyes, in your eyes
What you shout out!!!
Dodel up, dodel up, huh?
