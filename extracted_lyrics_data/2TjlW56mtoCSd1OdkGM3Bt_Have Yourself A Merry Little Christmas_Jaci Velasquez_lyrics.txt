3 ContributorsHave Yourself A Merry Little Christmas LyricsHave yourself a merry little Christmas
Let your heart be light
From now on our troubles will be out of sight
Mmmm...
Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Make the yuletide gay
From now on our troubles will be miles away
Here we are, as in olden days
Happy golden days of your
Faithful friends who are dear to us
Gather near to us once more
Through the years we all will be together
If the fates allow
Hang a shining star upon the highest cloud
And have yourself a merry little Christmas now
Wooo...
Have yourself a merry little Christmas nowYou might also likeEmbed
