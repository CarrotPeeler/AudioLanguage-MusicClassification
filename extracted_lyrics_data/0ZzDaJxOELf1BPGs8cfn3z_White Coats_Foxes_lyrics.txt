8 ContributorsWhite Coats Lyrics
As a child, my mother said to me
"Don't be afraid to lead the way you see
And it's only you who knows
Nobody else can see"
But do I chase myself into the dark?
And a thousand ways to lead me back to start
But you make it easier to be who I want to be

And if the men in white coats are coming
I know you'll still be there for me
To chase down the walls around us
I keep the memories inside my mind
To show me how to leave the darkness
You will take me home one day, believe me

Take my hand and lead me out from here
Hunted down, their footsteps drawing near
I knew you would come for me
I'm sorry you're in so deep

And if the men in white coats are coming
I know you'll still be there for me
To chase down the walls around us
I keep the memories inside my mind
To show me how to leave the darkness
You will take me home one day, believe me
You might also like
And I was so scared, I could not see the light
I didn't want to be alone
Would you just stand there and watch them hold me down?
I need to know that you're around


And I was so scared, I could not see the light
I didn't want to be alone
Would you just stand there and watch them hold me down?
I need to know that you're around2Embed
