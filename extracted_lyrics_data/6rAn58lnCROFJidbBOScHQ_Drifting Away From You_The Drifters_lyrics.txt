2 ContributorsDrifting Away From You LyricsI, I , I used to be happy, happy and so carefree
My worries were  as can be
But now they've started all over again
He caused you to drift away from me, drifting away
I love you, my dear, for it's plain to see
Your heart is cold and you want to be free
Come back, come back, I need you near
Oh, please, don't drift away from me
Darlin', please, don't, don't be a fool
And listen to what I have to say
Darlin', don't, don't walk out on my life like this
Oh, please don't drift away
Now, that you know, you know the way that I'm feelin'
Tell me what, what will your answer be?
Yeah, you fill my heart with happiness
Or will you drift away from me?
