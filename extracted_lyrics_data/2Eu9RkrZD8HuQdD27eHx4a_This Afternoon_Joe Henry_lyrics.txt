1 ContributorThis Afternoon LyricsOn the afternoon
That the revolution began
I was in a hotel pool with another kid
And an Australian business man
And nothing there would make you say
After all so much talk, today would be the day...
Nothing but an upset tray
Left by the pool
This afternoon
An orange cup was thrown
From an upstairs room
A cherry bomb of giddy lust, I guess
From a bride and groom
And nothing there would make you say
After all so much talk, today would be the day...
Nothing but an orange cup
From an upstairs room
This afternoon
I've spent every long summer
Just this way
Since my mother started making up their beds
And learning to look the other way
So what's one more drunk businessman
Coming on to me in the shallow end?
Nothing there would make you say
After all so much talk, today would be the day...

What's another slogan mean
Scrolled across my TV screen?
What's another bride and groom
Locked up in a fancy room?
What's one more drunk businessman
Coming on to me in the shallow end
This afternoon?Embed
