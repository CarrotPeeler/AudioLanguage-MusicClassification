1 ContributorTo My Fellow Space Drifters LyricsHere we go again
Swimming through the endless vacuum in the night
Don't know how I'm swimming, but I am
My spirit companion is a strange lizard, named Pamela Anderson Prime
I can only assume this is not his birth name
He intends to guide me, to show me the way
But I don't listen do I
I just don't fucking listen
And that'll be my downfall, I know
But not quite yet
I said
Here we go again
Swimming through the endless vacuum in the night
Don't know how I'm swimming, but I am
Looking for companionship, looking for love
No sign of life
I used to hate people who say hello too often
Too many times in one sentence, "hello, hello, hello, hello, sir, how do you do?"
Now I long for a greeting of any kind
Some variation to the brainless gaze of my fellow space drifters
No offense
Back on my home planetoid I used to dance around naked
Heavily concentrating on staying inside the weak and feeble gravitational field
I would speak there, to my imaginary audience
And bow politely as my performance came to an end
Though, sometimes I wonder if it ever did
You might also likeSo, here we go again
Swimming through the endless vacuum in the night
Just another mangy stray dog with an attitude problem
Pet me and ye shall receive the sickness
This is the end of line
Both literally and figuratively the old man cuts into my soul
Carves it into pieces as I cry and cry and smell a smell I've never smelled before
This is what they warned me of
It's the point of no returnEmbed
