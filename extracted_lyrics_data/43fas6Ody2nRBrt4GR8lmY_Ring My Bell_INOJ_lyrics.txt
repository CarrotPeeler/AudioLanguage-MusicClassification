Ooh, yeah
Ring my bell
Ooh, yeah
Ring my bell

I'm back
You're home
And did you really miss me?
I guess you did
By the look in your eyes

Now lay back, and relax
Let your body put away the distance
Then you and me can rock-a-bye

You can ring my bell
Ring my bell
You can ring my bell
Ring my bell
You can ring my bell
Ring my bell (ooh, yeah)
You can ring my bell
Ring my bell (mmm)
You might also like
Now the night is young
And full of possibilities
Well come on
And let yourself get free

Well the love (the love), for you (for you)
So long, I've been saving
But tonight, it's made for me and you

You can ring my bell
Ring my bell (my bell, ding-dong, ring my...)
You can ring my bell
Ring my bell (ring my bell)
You can ring my bell
Ring my bell (my bell, ding-dong, ring my...)
You can ring my bell
Ring my bell (my bell, ring-a-ling-a-ling)

You can ring my bell
You can ring my bell
Ding dong ding, ah, ring it (oh yeah)
You can ring my bell
Anytime, anyplace
Ring it (oh) ring it (oh) ring it ring it (ah)

You can ring my bell
Ring my bell (my bell, ding-dong, ring my...)
You can ring my bell
Ring my bell (ring my bell)
You can ring my bell
Ring my bell
You can ring my...
Anytime baby
You can ring my...
Anytime sugar
You can ring my...
In the daytime
You can ring my...
In the night timeEmbed
