6 ContributorsLove One Another Lyrics
Hey

Everybody needs a little tenderness
Everybody needs a release
From the cell they lock themselves in
Love's the only peace

Everybody needs, everybody cries
Everybody bleeds, everybody dies
Everybody dreams, everybody wakes
Everybody makes mistakes

Love one another, sisters and brothers
Love one another, hey
Love one another, father and mother
Love one another (Love one another), hey

It's easier to walk away when you've got a wounded pride
But when two people stand together
That's how they heal inside
Try to understand, open up your heart
A fist is just a hand, t can come apart
Let go of the past, let go of the fight
Forgiving fills the world with light

Hey

We were given a world so beautiful
A deep ocean, a blue, blue sky
I know we can make it a better place
If only you and I
(Love one another)
Oh yeah

Love one another, sisters and brothers
Love one another, hey
Love one another, father and mother
Love one another (Love one another)
Love one another, sisters and brothers
Love one another, hey
