A gust of cold wind freezes your breath:
A prelude for the Dark Hand
To catch your soul
You can imagine will happen to all
Bridge
It comes dressed in shades
From the silence of nowhere
A black face without a face
It's Dark Hand points at you
A deep voice echoes around
Listen to the call:
Chorus
"Come with me, follow me
Let the (your) pain behind
Don't be afraid to step
Into the silent land where
Twisted souls dance with the dark"
After you've left behind
Your chances and dreams
You realize and ask:
"What does it mean?" putting aside
Your problems and please
Will take you away from the following daysYou might also likeEmbed
