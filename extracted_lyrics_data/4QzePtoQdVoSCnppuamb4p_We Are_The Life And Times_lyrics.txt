2 ContributorsKickinâ€™ Back Being Blue Lyrics
I'm just kickin' back being blue
California ryda shit homie from the land of the true
Palm trees , Bomb weed, and blocks with the long heat
I came from the era of the longsocks to the knees
Posted on the corner in front of de la marketa
Holdin on a brown bag, sippin on cerveza
Stress out to them haters only people in my rear view
They whisperin like bitches, but honestly dont hear you
Anyone i fear who could take me out the place of me
Only with myself and not the mente of a champion
And i stand up big, born to ball and i stand tall , Breakin through like Marshawn Lynch when they handoff
One man standoff , go against the whole game , mentally insane to the brain , im like cocaine
To the feelings of the world , lyrically i blow brains , hopin if i die fast death not slow pain
Did i leave enough material to the game? Evolution of a G just tryna make a change
Dedicated to the homies run around me saying, Used to only talk about homies poppin thangs
Now im tryna teach a brown, how to stack like stack his change
Didn't have shit as a kid now i got some things
Ask myself, what will be my legacy? And what about the futures destiny?
Still, shout to the homies rest in peace, sad youngsters brainwashed, coast to coast from west to east
Praying "dear lord can you please bless the streets"? I Dont blame my homies breakin laws cuz they gotta eat
And the kids hungry, its hard to make money, grumbling tummies i mean this shit is not funny
My homie wicked, he shot a hura in the face, And the cops are killing youngsters just because of their a race
For a little dope money in the fast life take
Fools will sell their soul to satan just to get to a better a place
Im asking lord can you hear me? im really trying to make a change. Im asking lord can you steer me? and guide the future all the same, Thanks for the responsibility the youngsters growing up the same, i used to be proud of it now im sad that he got in the game

Bullets rang, Homies bang on the side im from
California lifestyle, homies on the run
Trying to change the game up with this evolution
Seeing things clear perfect with the evolution
Im just kicking back being blue, im just kicking back being blue
Im just kickin back, kickin back, kickin back being blue

Im just kickin back being blue, still representin for my side homie thought that you knew
West coast cali king, so im in royal blue
Fools still wanting my spot tryna be royal too
These are the life and times, of a young criminal, used to jack fools prolly why the tryna jack my style
Before the kick ,clap and bass was just click clack pow
Take a puff, blow clouds things are so different now
But im thankful, 5 jars filled with dank fool, i never knew we would be making so many people hate you
But im built for it, Sad that the homies still warring, but sorry is the very last thing i feel for em
We all make our own choices , All our own men all have our own voices, So im thinking since you kill for them Lincolns people lie, Still a G just to stack Ben Franklins
Brainwashed from the ways that lifes thought, You lose your life over a side that them whites brought, Green over all the rest with a nice thought, Im tryna own my own land over a nice plot
But it ain't just gunna happen, im talking late nights no sleep in the studio, hustlin , rappin , shootin my own videos tryna get it crackin,ask about this latin rap shit why they call me the assassin, Snoop Dogg, Warren G, Battlecat all co signed
Now im goin in for the shine like a gold mine, And i ain't gunna  let no one hold me back, one of the sickest on the track since maniac in black, and if you didn't know, that was my first solo track, on a come up with capone e was my very first plaque, but im still full of hunger tryna bring the game back
Seems like the perfect time, how could i take care of that
The homie loco told me "little homie reppin bang that"
So real from the quarter imma give the game that
All that old shit and old days, braggin about AK's, homies going to jail i mean this shits been played
X2

Bullets rang, Homies bang on the side im from
California lifestyle, homies on the run
Trying to change the game up with this evolution
Seeing things clear perfect with the evolution
Im just kicking back being blue, im just kicking back being blue
Im just kickin back, kickin back, kickin back being blueEmbed
