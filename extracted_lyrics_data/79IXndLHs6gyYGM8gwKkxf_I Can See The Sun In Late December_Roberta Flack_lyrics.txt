3 ContributorsI Can See the Sun in Late December Lyrics
I can see the sun
I can see the sun

I betcha you can't even see the sun
Ah, the sun is shining right before your eyes
I betcha you can't even see yourself
'Cause when you're lost
Sometimes yourself is hard to find

I can see the sun in late December
I see forgotten treasures 'neath the sea
Tides that defeat identity
Washing away the beauty that was in your mind
I can hear the sounds you don't remember
The sounds of birds and bees in harmony
Chords being blown by a gentle breeze
Making the perfect melody you left behind

I betcha you can't even see the moon
'Cause in your eyes you only see the darkest side
I betcha you can't wish upon a star
'Cause in your life your pride has pushed your dreams aside, hey
You might also like
I can see the sun in late December
I see forgotten treasures 'neath the sea
Tides that defeat identity
Washing away the beauty that was in your mind
I can hear the sounds you don't remember
The sounds of birds and bees in harmony
Chords being blown by a gentle breeze
Making the perfect melody you left behind

La-da, la-da, la-da, la-da
La-da, la-da, la-da-da, la-da

I can see the sun in late December
I see forgotten treasures 'neath the sea
Tides that defeat identity
Washing away the beauty that was in your mind
I betcha I can see the sun
See forgotten treasures 'neath the sea
Tides that defeat identity (I can see the sun)
Washing away the beauty in your mind
I betcha I can hear the sounds
Sounds of birds and bees in harmony
Chords being blown by a gentle breeze
(Sounds you don't remember)
I can hear the sounds, sounds
Sounds you don't remember
I can see the sun, sun
Sun in late December
I betcha I can see the sun
See forgotten treasures 'neath the sea
Tides that defeat identity (I can see the sun)
Washing away the beauty in your mind

I can see the sun
I can see the sun
I can see the sun
I can see the sun
I can see the sun
