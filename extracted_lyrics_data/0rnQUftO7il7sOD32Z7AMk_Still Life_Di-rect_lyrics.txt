5 ContributorsStill Life LyricsStill life sun is down
All the light and shadows rest
Don't move you know you're safe
Posing in the evening shade
Sit close and watch the world
All is falling into place
You are a work of art
Bathing in the color of spring
To have you by my side
It makes me feel alive
Dark night the stars align
They spiral out from older light
Your smile it seems to last
Even at the early dawn
In my eyes there's a silver storm
Turning all the joy to ice
Still life come talk to me
Your brush is one that paints me the best
To have you by my side
It makes me feel alive
It makes me feel alive
You whisper me your life in a sacred harmony
You illuminate the night
And gave love I couldn't find
Your selflessness reminds me there's nothing left but peace
And I thank you for thatYou might also likeEmbed
