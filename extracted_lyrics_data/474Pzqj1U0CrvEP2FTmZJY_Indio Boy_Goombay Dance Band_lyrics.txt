An indio boy is prayin' to the stars of silver-blue
'Cause's so alone - mummy's gone
Gone into the land of no return
Four white sheep and a little dog is all she left behind
He's playin' on a wooden pipe all songs he's got in mind
Songs that mummy sang - bringing back again
Bringing back the days of love and joy
Indio boy, you got to learn to know
Little indio boy, that life is always so
Let the morning sun shine into your heart
And the world's no longer dark - indio boy
Someday when you're grown up you'll get children of your own
Tell them it ain't no shame just to be a poor man's son
With a heart of gold - an honest soul
You will stand the evil of the world
Indio boy, you got to learn to know
Little indio boy, that life is always so
Let the morning sun shine into your heart
And the world's no longer dark - indio boyYou might also likeEmbed
