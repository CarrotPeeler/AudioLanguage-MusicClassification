We've been here too long, tryin' to get along
Pretendin' that you're oh, so shy
I'm a natural ma'am, doin' all I can
My temperature is runnin' high

Cry at night, no one in sight
And we got so much to share
Talking's fine, if you got the time
But, I ain't got the time to spare, yeah

Do you wanna touch? (Yeah!)
Do you wanna touch? (Yeah!)
Do you wanna touch me there? Where?
Do you wanna touch? (Yeah!)
Do you wanna touch? (Yeah!)
Do you wanna touch me there? Where?
There? Yeah

(Yeah, oh, yeah, oh, yeah)
(Yeah, oh, yeah, oh, yeah)

Every girl an' boy needs a little joy
All you do is sit an' stare
Beggin' on my knees, baby, won't you please
Run your fingers through my hair?
You might also like
My, my, my, whiskey and rye
Don't it make you feel so fine?
Right or wrong, don't it turn you on?
Can't you see we're wastin' time? Yeah

Do you wanna touch? (Yeah!)
Do you wanna touch? (Yeah!)
Do you wanna touch me there? Where?
Do you wanna touch? (Yeah!)
Do you wanna touch? (Yeah!)
Do you wanna touch me there? Where?
There? Yeah!

(Yeah, oh, yeah, oh, yeah)
(Yeah, oh, yeah, oh, yeah) Do you, do you?
(Yeah, oh, yeah, oh, yeah) Do you, do you?
(Yeah, oh, yeah, oh, yeah) Do you wanna touch? Do you wanna touch me there?
(Yeah, oh, yeah, oh, yeah) Do you wanna touch? Do you wanna touch me there? Yeah
(Yeah, oh, yeah, oh, yeah) My, my, my, do you wanna touch me? Yeah, yeah
(Yeah, oh, yeah, oh, yeah) Oh, no, fuck me, fuck! Yeah, do you wanna touch me? Yeah
(Yeah, oh, yeah, oh, yeah) Touch me there

(Yeah, oh, yeah, oh, yeah)Embed
