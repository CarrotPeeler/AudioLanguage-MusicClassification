1 ContributorTime Lyrics
Now listen to this
It's a hip hop tune at the end of the day, you know
Come with it bad boy

If they ask you how we're feeling
Just tell 'em we're feeling fine cos we know the time

Will you make some noise for Leslie Lyrics

I want to hear it from the north side
And the south side
And the east side
And the west side
Cos in rap music, we shouldn't have no divide
I want to see us all jamming side by side
The white and the black and the black and thе white
Let's unite and fight for what's right tonight
Thе black and the white, the while and the black
If you don't want to see that, jack step back
Cos too many racists don't want to see this
And their thesis has no basis
And I say this with full authority
As a member of an ethnic minority
Subjected to the whims of the ignorant masses
Divided by colour, sexes and classes
Enough is enough, yeah ?I think we time now?
And that is something Leslie just won't allow
You might also like

We know of the time is my latest design
Another lyrical miracle from the latent mind
Of a lyricist whose only design
Is to reach the masses and teach the yound blind
My mother always tell me "son, seek and you will find"
You can't see the sign of this time you must be blind
Mankind (Do you wanna know the time?)
Stop! Take a look at yourself
Put your weight upon the shelf so you move it with stealth
And then your lust for wealth, you're just damaging your health
C'mon! Now what happen whn you achieve your goals?
Just when you think you have control
And about to make the good times roll
See life catches up and takes it toll
*scratching*
Leslie Lyric


Here it is coloured people you must be aware
The reason Leslie Lyric is standing up here
So peep this here, so lend me an ear
Me have a track here and show I care
But what's going on in this world in this world we're living in
We don't have long to beat the system
Which sees us persecuting one another
On a basis as fragile as sex and colour

Now listen to this
It's a hip hop tune at the end of the day, you know
Done broken into two minute pieces
Me cut my teeth on rub-a-dub you know
