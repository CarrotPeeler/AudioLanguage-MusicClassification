How strong your heart is
And all this time, my mind was working
In strange ways
Looking back on the days, just wanna be free
Through the love in your eyes
Now i'm staring inside, just wanna be free
Through the love in your eyes
Sweet tides, pools of love
Your eyes are full of...
Sweet tides, pools of love
Your eyes are full of...
Sharp turn, my mind is a blur
Slow passage thru the air
Looking back on the days
All over your mind, just wanna be free
Sweet tides, pools of love
Your eyes are full of...
Sweet tides, pools of love
Your eyes are full of...
It took so long, for me to realize
How strong your heart is
And all this time, my mind was working
In strange ways
