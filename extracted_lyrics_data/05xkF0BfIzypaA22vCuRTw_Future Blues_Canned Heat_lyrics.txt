3 ContributorsFuture Blues LyricsWho'll tell your future?  I can't tell my past
Who'll tell your future?  I can't tell my past
Seem like every minute, Lord, is sure gonna be my last
Gonna hoodoo you baby, got you on my mind
Hoodoo you, baby, got you on my mind
When you feel my spell, darlin', it will drive you right outta your mind
You're a crazy little mama, and you know you can't be beat
I got somethin' for you, baby, that is awful sweet
Come on, little mama, gonna knock you right off your feet
See that picture, baby, hangin' up on your mama's shelf?
See that picture, baby, hangin' up on your mama's shelf?
I'm gettin' tired, tired, tired, Lord, of sleepin' all by myself
Who'll tell your future?  I can't tell my past
Who'll tell your future?  I can't tell my past
Seem like every minute, Lord, is sure gonna be my last
Though the past was sour, Lord, the future can be mighty sweet
We finally found a home, and our love just can't be beat
You know it's forever, and I'm never, never gonna leave
This is your future, you can forget about the past
This is your future, you can forget about the past
Our love is gonna grow, and you know that it's gonna lastSee Canned Heat LiveGet tickets as low as $41You might also likeEmbed
