2 ContributorsThis Is War LyricsHe was enslaved to the dirty system
Pero murió, mother fucking come on
This was the final mission
His life had just begun
It all had to be so fucked up
His death to me, so fucked up
His face remains so deathless -- This is war
And I swear that I'm not giving up
Or giving in -- This is war?
Then I swear that I'm not giving up
Or giving in -- or giving up
This is war
This is war
Society is a loaded weapon
No one is exempt from the bullet within
El systema is a prime example
De lo que pasa cuando
The streets could be so fucked up
His destiny so fucked up
His face remain so deathless -- This is war

Or giving in -- This is war?
Then I swear that I'm not giving up
Or giving in -- or giving up
This is war
This is war
Dios mio, alma mia, ¿por qué me has llevado la vida
Cuando yo todo te lo he dado?
En mi hora de muerte, no me dejes morir
Necesito otra vida, necesito que me digas...
Is this war? Is this war?
This is war1Embed
