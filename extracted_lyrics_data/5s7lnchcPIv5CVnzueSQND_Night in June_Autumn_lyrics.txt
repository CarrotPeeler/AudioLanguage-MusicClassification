1 ContributorNight In June LyricsYou took my hand, you called my name
You knew I'd heard everything you do
I love your face and I like your style
When I want love I just call for you
I remember every word you said
I remember every night in June
I may have lost all that you gave to me
I'll do anything to get me beside you
So if you want me, I still have time
But all I want is to share it with you
You know I can't stand that you feel hurt
I will take care of you, it will get true
You will remember every word you said
You will remember every night in June
I love your face and I like your style
When I want love I just call for you
I know when I want love I just call for you
I know when I want love I just call for you
Make you sorry, can't I come?
Well I can see it right, oh, let me try
Oh, you're silent, can't you see
I want you to share another night in June
You might also likeMake you sorry, can't I come?
Well I can see it right, oh, let me try
Oh, you're silent, can't you see
I want you to share another night in June
Ohh, Ohh, another night in June
Ohh, Ohh, another night in June
