Refrain from the way we were
Slain the invincible
Changed are the ways of man
Fortitude to face the path

Vanquish the pain
Don't want to see it fail
Faith divides us, death unites us
Vanquish the pain
Don't want to seek despair
Faith divides us, death unites us

Tears for a hopeless case
Outside is still so vague
Frayed the landscapes of old
Cleared the indelible

Vanquish the pain
Don't want to see it fail
Faith divides us, death unites us
Vanquish the pain
Don't want to seek despair
Faith divides us, death unites us

Cannot sleep through darkened skies
Cannot dream until it's over
Cannot sleep through darkened skies
Cannot dream until it's over

Vanquish the pain
Don't want to see it fail
Faith divides us, death unites us
Vanquish the pain
Don't want to seek despairEmbed
