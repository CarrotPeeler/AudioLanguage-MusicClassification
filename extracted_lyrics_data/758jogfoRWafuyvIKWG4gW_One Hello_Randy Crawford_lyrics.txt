1 ContributorOne Hello Lyrics
If you're not afraid
Of what love brings
Then endings are beginnings
Of beautiful things
It's a chance you'll take
A chance you'll win
If someone's gonna find you
First you've gotta let them in

'Cause love begins with one hello
The hardest part is over
Now it's easy letting go
One hello is how it starts
You might win it all or lose your heart

If you're not afraid
Of what you feel
Then try and keep it simple
But try and keep it real
And if being real
Means you'll some day say goodbye
Remember, my friend
Goodbye's not the end
It's a circle, you know
And it starts with one hello
You might also like
Oh, love begins with one hello
The hardest part is over
Now it's easy letting go
One hello is how it starts
Remember, my friend
Goodbye's not the end
It's a circle, you know
And it starts, starts with one hello
It starts with one helloEmbed
