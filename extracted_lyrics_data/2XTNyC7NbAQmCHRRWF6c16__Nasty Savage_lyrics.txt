(Mello made it right)

God sat me down and told me, "Youngin', you the one"
Givenchy, Louis, BAPE, the only thing, I'm from the slums
White gold Presidential, maybe I should run
Still get 'em by the ton, sixty-five three times a month
Baggin', what you doin'? Baggin', baggin'
2020 McLaren, Moe got me thinkin' 'bout  cashin'
Bitch, I'm a savage (Ho), Megan (Savage), nasty (Savage)
Heard I fucked her friend, she keep callin' me a savage
She gon' suck it 'cause she nasty (Freak ho)
Once I fuck her, I be laughin' (Fuck off)
We'll never meet again, only thing I eat is tens (Bad ho)
Baggin', what you doin'? Baggin', baggin'
Youngest of the MOB (I didn't know Marshmello could make a beat that hard, man)

After everything I gave, how you tell me I ain't shit?
All that money that I made, that was 'posed to keep us lit
You was out here suckin' dick, I was tryna pay the (Rent)
I was tryna pay the, I was tryna pay the rent
Free my niggas from the 6, if not weed, then it's a brick
All my youngins takin' hits, fifteen hundred for the mix
Show you to make it ten, I get three, bro, from a gram
I know how to make it dance, twenty-two just for the pants
Ho, quit lying, bitch, you a fan, if it's true, I want the head
I fell back on sellin' meds, I'm supposed to be with Tez
Facin' five years in the feds, ask me, am I though
Ask God, not at all, fuck me, whole lotta cash
You might also like
God sat me down and told me, "Youngin', you the one"
Givenchy, Louis, BAPE, the only thing, I'm from the slums
White gold Presidential, maybe I should run
Still get 'em by the ton, sixty-five three times a month
Baggin', what you doin'? Baggin', baggin'
2020 McLaren, Moe got me thinkin' 'bout  cashin'
Bitch, I'm a savage (Ho), Megan (Savage), nasty (Savage)
Heard I fucked her friend, she keep callin' me a savage
She gon' suck it 'cause she nasty (Freak ho)
Once I fuck her, I be laughin' (Fuck off)
We'll never meet again, only thing I eat is tens (Bad ho)
Baggin', what you doin'? Baggin', baggin'
Youngest of the MOB, R.I.P. my young nigga Rob

Prolly throw a six, never a five, yeah, 4's
Tell the world get off my dick
I get nervous when I get mentioned
Bro do four a week in Cinci
Could be five, but he too picky
Keep that fye, bitch, don't get Ricky'd
Without my guys, feel like something missin'
Too many pride, fucked too many bitches
Moral of the story, I don't fuck with you niggas
You tryna get fame, fuck around, get painted
Proud of myself, I don't do no hangin'
Throw it up, nigga, let 'em know what you claimin'
Big 4's, Big 4's
God sat me down and told me, "Youngin', you the one"
Givenchy, Louis, BAPE, the only thing, I'm from the slums
White gold Presidential, maybe I should run
Still get 'em by the ton, sixty-five three times a month
Baggin', what you doin'? Baggin', baggin'
2020 McLaren, Moe got me thinkin' 'bout  cashin'
Bitch, I'm a savage (Ho), Megan (Savage), nasty (Savage)
Heard I fucked her friend, she keep callin' me a savage
She gon' suck it 'cause she nasty (Freak ho)
Once I fuck her, I be laughin' (Fuck off)
We'll never meet again, only thing I eat is tens (Bad ho)
Baggin', what you doin'? Baggin', baggin'
Youngest of the MOB, R.I.P. my young nigga Rob4Embed
