My darling I don't wanna lose it
Wrap your little arms round mine
I'll try to lift you up
Sunlight my darling I'm calling your heart
We can turn our heads to each other
Lay down
Did you wonder how I feel
My darling I'm gonna love you
We can lean eyes to each other
And see a world upon
Dedicate my love
Place your little hands in mine
Dedicate my love
Try to wake up
My darling I don't wanna lose it
Wrap your little arms round mine
I'll try to lift you up
Dedicate my love
Place your little hands in mine
Dedicate my love
Dedicate my love
Dedicate my love
