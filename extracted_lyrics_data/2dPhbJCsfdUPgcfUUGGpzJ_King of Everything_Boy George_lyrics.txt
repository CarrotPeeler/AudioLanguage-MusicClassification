2 ContributorsKing of Everything LyricsPut down the booze
Let the demons win the fight
Dropped my gloves to the ground
You know I'm sorry
For the times I made you cry
I made an art of letting you down
(Bridge)
I used to say
It's only me I'm hurting
But I saw you on the stairs
The kid was crying
And the dogs were howling
And a siren filled the air
What's the word on the street
Have I lost my crown
Or will I be king again
What's the word on the street
Have I lost my crown
Or will I be king of everything
Tempted myself time & time again
Like self destruction was so cool
I mocked your tears and I scarred your heart
I blamed the past and I blamed you
