28 ContributorsBleed the Freak Lyrics
My cup runneth over
Like blood from a stone

These stand for me
Name your god and bleed the freak
I'd like to see
How you all would bleed for me

When the pig runs slower (Slower)
Let the arrow fly (Fly)
When the sin lies bolder (Bolder)
I'll pluck out thine eye (I'll pluck out thine eye)

These stand for me
Name your god and bleed the freak
I'd like to see
How you all would bleed for me

If you scorn my lover (Lover)
Satan got your thigh (Thigh)
If you steal in hunger (Hunger)
I will kick you when you try (When you try)

These stand for me
Name your god and bleed the freak
I'd like to see
How you all would bleed for me


Ah (Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha)
All these things that you've done for me (Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha)
Have left me so fucking tired, ooh (Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha)
I'm not saying that you haven't done a lot of good
But if there's one thing you can do
You can bleed for me, bleed for me (Ah)

These stand for me
Name your god and bleed the freak
I'd like to see
How you all would bleed for me
These stand for me
Name your god and bleed the freak
I'd like to see
How you all would bleed for me4Embed
