5 ContributorsGirl of My Dreams Lyrics
Yeah, The Ambassadors
Uh, excuse me miss, what's your name?
Keith back again so tell all your friends
(Again)
Keith Sweat (Keith Sweat, Keith Sweat, Keith Sweat)
Let's go

I'm not hatin' on him but I'm finger pointin'
'Cause I always see you cry and you never tell nobody why
I see you with your diamond ring (Diamond ring)
And he can buy you any brand name (You chose)
I'd do the same thing if I was in his shoes (Talk to 'em)

But what about the days? (He comes back)
Like when he comes in the house (You catch slack)
Taking it out on you (Makes me mad)
Just when I start to come through (But then I fall back)

Some day I will steal your love (I will steal your love), soon enough (Away)
(It tears me up)

It tears me up inside to see your crying eyes
Pouring like a waterfall 'cause he don't treat you right
You gotta close shop on him, to the next stop, warning
That's not how you treat the woman of my dreams
(Keith, talk to 'em)
See Keith Sweat LiveGet tickets as low as $75You might also like
Maybe I'm being nosy
Everything he does I know it
The long nights to the fights, kisses to the hugs
I'm sitting here wishing it was us, ooh!
How can I take the game
Flip it upside-down instead of him?
Baby girl, I should be your man
You should be sleeping in my bed

You're supposed to be riding
In the passenger seat of my car
Let me make a move, it's time I starred

Some day I will steal your love (I will steal your love), soon enough (Away)
(He doesn't deserve you)

It tears me up inside to see your crying eyes (See your cryin' eyes)
Pouring like a waterfall (Like a waterfall) 'cause he don't treat you right
You gotta close shop on him, to the next stop, warning
That's not how you treat the woman of my dreams
(Here we go again)
It's painful to sit around
Watching the girl of my dreams
(Held by another who can treat you no better)
It's painful 'cause I'm alone
And she's the reason for being
Girl, I've fallen
Darling, you know I'm falling

When I made my way to the house
The words rolled out my mouth
Like, Excuse me miss, what's your name?
It's kinda hard for me to explain
I've been watching but I'm not insane
All I know is, yeah

It tears me up inside to see your crying eyes (See your cryin' eyes)
Pouring like a waterfall (Like a waterfall) 'cause he don't treat you right
You gotta close shop on him, to the next stop, warning
That's not how you treat the woman of my dreams
(Here we go again)
It tears me up inside to see your crying eyes (See your cryin' eyes)
Pouring like a waterfall (Like a waterfall) 'cause he don't treat you right
You gotta close shop on him, to the next stop, warning
That's not how you treat the woman of my dreams
(Here we go again)Embed
