5 ContributorsEverybody Doesnâ€™t Lyrics
Everybody does it, that's what you keep saying
Everybody doesn't, not everybody's playing
I wanna be your girlfriend
But you gotta put the pressure off, just stop

I think you've got a one track mind
But you're so focused on the destination that you're missing the ride
You tell me you're a patient guy
But we're not having conversations 'cause you're preoccupied

If I loved you, I would
If you loved me, I wouldn't have to
If I were in your shoes
Never expect you to get down

Everybody does it, that's what you keep saying
Everybody doesn't, not everybody's playing
I wanna be your girlfriend
But you gotta put the pressure off (Turn the pressure off)
Everybody does it, that's what you keep saying
Everybody doesn't, not everybody's playing (Everybody doesn't)
I wanna be your girlfriend (I wanna be your girlfriend)
But you gotta put the pressure off (Oh no)

Ooh, you're good, you try real hard
So just fill out your application, I'll let you know next year
You don't believe when I say no, no, no
If you don't give me considerations, then you'll have to go

If I loved you, I would
If you loved me, I wouldn't have to
If I were in your shoes
Never expect you to get down

Everybody does it, that's what you keep saying
Everybody doesn't, not everybody's playing
I wanna be your girlfriend
But you gotta put the pressure off (Turn the pressure off)
Everybody does it, that's what you keep saying
Everybody doesn't, not everybody's playing (Everybody doesn't)
I wanna be your girlfriend (I wanna be your girlfriend)
But you gotta put the pressure off (Oh no)

No, uh-uh-uh
No, yeah-yeah-yeah
No, uh-uh-uh
No
Break it down for me, baby
Come and chill, turn the pressure off
Come and dance with me, sexy
Everybody does it, that's what you keep saying (Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Everybody doesn't, not everybody's playing
I wanna be your girlfriend
But you gotta put the pressure off (Turn the pressure off, my baby)
Everybody does it, that's what you keep saying
Everybody doesn't, not everybody's playing
I wanna be your girlfriend (I wanna be your girlfriend)
But you gotta put the pressure off (Oh, oh, oh, oh)
Everybody does it, that's what you keep saying
Everybody, everybody's playing
I wanna be your girlfriend
But you gotta put the pressure off
Gotta put the pressure off
Everybody does it, that's what you keep saying
Everybody, everybody's playing
I wanna be your girlfriend
But you gotta put the pressure off
Just stopEmbed
