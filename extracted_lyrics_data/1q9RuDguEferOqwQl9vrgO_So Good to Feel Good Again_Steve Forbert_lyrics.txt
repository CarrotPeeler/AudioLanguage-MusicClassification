2 ContributorsSo Good To Feel Good Again LyricsI had to get loose from those quarrelling tongues
Had to get free from that ball and chain
Had to get far from those boring towns
And it's so good to feel good again (home on the highway)
Round the bend, good again (back on the track)
Had to get down from that high horse cloud
Maybe in time I can find clean rain
I'm standin' here broke, but I don't think bent
An' it's so good to feel good again (home on the highway)
Round the bend, good again (back on the track)
So good to feel good again (home on the highway)
Round the bend, good again (back on the track)
And I find the best of things in life still free
An' they'll stay the best things 'cause they are free, see?
Can't own the sunset, some might try
Some people think you're just a toy they'll buy
I could've gone bats in the bell tower babe
Nothin' rang true 'cept a none stop pain
I'm standin' here cold in these nowhere winds

Round the bend, good again (back on the track)

Had to get gone from those fishbowl blues
I've been a good boy now for so long I'm strange
I'm standin' here numb in these great unknowns
And it's so good to feel good again (home on the highway)
Round the bend, good again (back on the track)
So good to feel good again (home on the highway)
Round the bend, good again (back on the track)
So good to feel good again (home on the highway)
Round the bend, good again (back on the track)
So good to feel good again (home on the highway)
Round the bend, good again (back on the track)Embed
