1 ContributorSide (With You) Lyrics
If I had fun
I would've stuck around
With a little bit of sympathy
We would have had it made
I've been searchin'
Yeah, that ain't no crime
I've been learnin'
And gettin' by

Stands a stranger
Was a friend
We made a beginning
Never made the end
I've been learnin'
Yeah, that ain't no crime
Not burning bridges
For some peace of mind

Have you learned how to fight?
Would you know what to say?
If you had it all
Could you give it away?
I'll side with you
My friends, they defend me
When I'm broken, she can mend me
I'll side with you
You might also like
If I had fun
I would've stuck around
With a little bit of sympathy
We would have had it made
I've been searchin'
Yeah, that ain't no crime
I've been learnin'
And getting by

Have you learned how to fight?
Would you know what to say?
If you had it all
Could you give it away?
I'll side with you
My friends, they defend me
When I'm broken, she can mend me
I'll side with you

I'll side with you
I'll side with you
My friends, they defend me
When I'm broken, she can mend me
I'll side with youEmbed
