6 ContributorsIn Her Arms Lyrics
I've been dreaming of a
I've been dreaming of a heart that lies
You've been looking at me
You've been looking at me eye to eye

Take it easy
And lift your feet up off the burning ground
And you don't see it
You get so high because you don't look down

She wants to hold you in her arms
She wants to tear you away from my heart
Does she light up like a lantern
To show you the way through the dark?
Does she give you what you're missing?
It's more than enough what we are
In her arms, in her arms
In her arms, in her arms

You’ve been leaving me
You’ve been leaving me alone at night
But in my empire
I am king and I own the sky
You might also like
While you're sleeping
Now the bed you made is burning down
Keep breathing
All the birds you caged are breaking out

She wants to hold you in her arms
She wants to tear you away from my heart
Does she light up like a lantern
To show you the way through the dark?
Does she give you what you're missing?
It's more than enough what we are
In her arms, in her arms

Let there be smoke in my eyes
It stops me breathing
I see her arms open wide
It stops me breathing

She wants to hold you in her arms
She wants to tear you away from my heart
Does she light up like a lantern
To show you the way through the dark?
Does she give you what you're missing?
It's more than enough what we are
In her arms, in her arms2Embed
