1 ContributorFalling Behind LyricsWe are all equal but we're individually different
And able to reach the impossible if we try
We find faith and strength in the most unlikely places
And love sometimes eludes us, but we try
We keep searching and one day we find ...
Life goes on and around like a wheel
It keeps on turning, that's the deal
Why are we running?
We're running so fast to keep from falling behind
Problems come and they go and
In the end what will you show?
Why are we worried?
We worry so much, worry about falling behind
Is it really all about the thing
Of what you wear and what you think I'll think?
Who has more?
Arabs and Jews at war, I don't care anymore
It's always the same tired story
How many dead in the name of some god?
And what's the difference?
Don't give a damn about their differences
Nothing's sacred once the shooting starts

It keeps on turning, that's for real
Why are we running?
We're running so fast to keep from falling behind
What may come and what may go
And in the end what will you show for all your worries?
Why worry so much, why worry about falling behind?
The plans already in motion
It happens whether we say
The old world order is over
Intelligence and love win the day
I won't regret one moment
Life is too short for that, bring it on
Life goes on and around like a wheel
It keeps on turning, that's the deal
Why are we running?
We're running so fast to keep from falling behind
Problems come and they go and
In the end what will you show?
Why are we worried?
Why worry so much? Don't worry about falling behindEmbed
