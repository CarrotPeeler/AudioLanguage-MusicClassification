5 ContributorsCopperhead Kiss Lyrics
You got me shakin' in my boots 

How come you never talk back when I want you to?
'Come you never talk trash when I want you to?
Come to mine, come to mine any time again
Take me for a ride
Close my eyes as she say goodnight
Copperhead kiss, then she twist the knife
How come you never talk back when I want you to?
'Come you never talk trash when I want you to?
Come to mine, come to mine any time again
Take me for a ride
Close my eyes as she say goodnight
Copperhead kiss, then she twist the knife
I gon be nice
Sharpen yours and I sharpen mine
I gon be nice
Dance by me when you kill the light
 stringin' you along
No matter what you do, never walk away until the job is --
You might also likeHow come you never talk back when I want you to?
'Come you never talk trash when I want you to?
Come to mine, come to mine any time again
Take me for a ride
Close my eyes as she say goodnight
Copperhead kiss, then she twist the knife
I gon be nice
Sharpen yours and I sharpen mine
I gon be nice
Dance by me when you kill the light
