It ain't a question of trust
It ain't a question of loyalty
That ain't a question for us
For us, for us, for us
It ain't a question of trust
It ain't a question of loyalty
That ain't a question for us
For us, for us, for us

As I continue and proceed
I will progress through this road test, believe
My loyalty is never in question
The flow as grotesque as ever, I breeze in, George Benson
A couple notes in my pocket and I'm so composed
With Denzel flair I Elm Street the dishevelled
Attic man I walk the paths of McKasty
The late great, I will take solace in, I surmise
Thinking of cash-flow, family and shelter
Whenever frustrated I will six gear this mic
And try to block my path, so I will re-calibrate
Wear the peak forward and visualize the light
"I'm not a regular competitor, first rhyme editor"
You might also likeThe cover is a stamp-sized version of a bigger picture
I study what I know is classic
Put down my slab of funk, my life inside a A4 pad
Play the game like a Akai
Stay in brief contact with past allies
Some are match fit, some are ring rusty and it's crazy how
Pain and loss will keep a man sharp
Believe your own hype

As the world rotates I watch and observe
Chaperoning my kin, calculate and confirm
Microphone in my palm, fitted cap on the brow
MPC tucked under the arm and, yeah
It's a long way down from here
Life at a perilous height that most won't reach
Be on your Ps and Qs and stay chisel
Remain calm, loyal and true, remain official

That's right, British Aerospace
I will spit grand, foot down, R8 V10
Covered in symbols of status, the emblems is laminated
Fresh decals on the paintwork
And if you're not in no regular contact
Then you're in no position to put that ten pence in my fitted
And my five-panel's so valid
A decade of visors I advise the subscribers
The fury of men, some glorious victory
The winning streak is in place, I'm at battle stations
Where I leave my cap, that's my home
I'm Notts born, Notts grown
Nottingham's own
Paint a picture like Pablo, a Ready Brek glow
On any cold unforgiving scene
I sophisticate a basic gist
I've got the vice grip grasp on this process
From the rough sketch to the high gloss
It ain't a question of trust
Nah
It ain't a question of loyalty

The history behind the idea
The sequence of events before the outcome
The seed planted and the roots grown
Loyalty will make the leaves sprout and breed truth now
Welcome to a world of difference, you are worlds apart
I spar with clean conscience
Louisiana yellow on the black and LA on the green
Fitted fiend bald head itâ€™s in the genes heavy regime
They're paying homage to a broke promise
I'm still hand on my wallet saying 'I ain't never going broke'
The rhyme schemes is lucrative
The loops is hypnotic and self-sufficient
I think of this, no doubt I'm putting in work
Put it there, y'all, shake on it
If we in agreement then co-sign
All or nothing, cos you and I know that it's do or die
And I ain't never trying to be sane of mind

As the world rotates I watch and observe
Chaperoning my kin, calculate and confirm
Microphone in my palm, fitted cap on the brow
MPC tucked under the arm and, yeah
It's a long way down from here
Life at a perilous height that most won't reach
Be on your Ps and Qs and stay chisel
Remain calm, loyal and true, remain official
It ain't a question of trust
It ain't a question of loyalty
That ain't a question for us
For us, for us, for us
It ain't a question of trust
It ain't a question of loyalty
That ain't a question for us
For us, for us, for usEmbed
