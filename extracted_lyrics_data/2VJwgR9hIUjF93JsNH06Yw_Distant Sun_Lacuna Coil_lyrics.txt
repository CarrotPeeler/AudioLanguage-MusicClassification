5 ContributorsDistant Sun Lyrics
We've never been apart
The day has come
I'm feelin' that your sun
Shines away from me...
Tease me
Holding my hands, you smile again
I couldn't see you away from me
I do realise it now...

Living in me...
You're living in me...
You're living in me...

I feel you by my side...at night...
Your living soul wants to run away with me...
Inside of me
I feel you by my side...at night...
Your living soul wants to run away with me...
Inside of me...

And now
Will something happen to me?
How did I lose my guide?
You left me all alone
Now is too late
I know it's natural, but now
What can I do without your presence here?
A never-ending...pain (pain, pain, pain, pain)

Living in me...
You're living in me...
You're living in me...

I feel you by my side... (oh my)
Your living soul wants to run away with me
Inside of me...
I feel you by my side... (oh my)
And I'm sure that I can't forget you...
You're inside of me...
Inside of me...
Inside of me...
Inside of me...Embed
