4 ContributorsThe Princess of Hollywood Way Lyrics
I've been there, believe me
Crimes committed are unintentional
After the party
We all went home alone

All the industry boys were still laughing and drinking
When I tumbled out of the place
And up on the wall
The princess of Hollywood way

The Wilton House is empty
Autumn came again and everyone scattered
Maybe it's better
If we don't have that last place to go

Well, you said that you'd call when you got your new number
I guess you've gone under again
There's room at the bar
For the princess of Hollywood way

Wine and forgiveness, hmm-mm
Wine and forgiveness
Wine and forgiveness were all that we had, oh, yeah!
You might also like

Wine and forgiveness, hmm-mm
Wine and forgiveness
Wine and forgiveness are all that I need, oh-whoa, ooh
Ooh

"Go to bed", she said, "I can't stand you!
And that's the only thing that we have in common
If I had a nickel
For every bridge that you've burned
You're just a single malt swamp clown preparing for splashdown
The accidents know you by name"

"After all, I'm the princess of Hollywood
After all, I'm the princess of Hollywood
After all, I'm the princess of Hollywood way"Embed
