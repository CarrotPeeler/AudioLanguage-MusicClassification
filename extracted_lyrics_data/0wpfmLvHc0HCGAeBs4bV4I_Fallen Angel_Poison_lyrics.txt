13 ContributorsFallen Angel Lyrics
She stepped off the bus
Out into the city streets
Just a small town girl with her whole life packed
In a suitcase by her feet
But somehow the lights didn't shine as bright
As they did on her mama's TV screen
And the work seemed harder, days seemed longer
Than she ever thought they'd be

But you know, you gotta stick to your guns
When it all comes down
'Cause sometimes you can't choose
It's like heads they win, tails you're gonna lose

Win big, mama's fallen angel
Lose big, living out her lies
Wants it all, mama's fallen angel
Lose it all, rolling the dice of her life

Now she found herself in the fast lane
Livin' day to day
Turned her back on her best friends, yeah
And watched her family slip away
And just like a lost soul caught up in the Hollywood scene
All the parties and the limousines
Such a good actress hiding all her pain
Trading her memories for fortune and fame
You might also like
Just a step away
From the edge of a fall
Caught between Heaven and Hell
Where's the girl I knew a year ago?

Win big, mama's fallen angel
Lose big, living out her lies
Wants it all, mama's fallen angel
Lose it all, rolling the dice of her life

Too much, too soon
Or just a little too late
'Cause when her ship came in
She wasn't there, it just wouldn't wait

Win big, mama's fallen angel
Lose big, living out her lies
Wants it all, mama's fallen angel
Lose it all, rolling the dice of her life
Win big, mama's fallen angel
Lose big, living out her lies
Wants it all, mama's fallen angel
Lose it all, rolling the dice of her life
Win big, mama's fallen angel
Lose big, living out her lies
Wants it all, mama's fallen angel
Lose it all, rolling the dice of her life
Win big, mama's fallen angel
Lose big, living out her lies
Wants it all, mama's fallen angel
Lose it all, rolling the dice of her lifeEmbed
