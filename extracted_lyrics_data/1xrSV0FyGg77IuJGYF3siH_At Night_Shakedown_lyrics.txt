(Ah, mhm)
(Hey)
(Yeah)

Seems I can't deny
Some days just don't feel right
I think I feel, I think I feel much better at night
Seems I can't deny
Some days just don't feel right
I think I feel, I think I feel much better at night
Seems I can't deny
Some days just pass me by
You know I feel, I think I feel much better at night
(Yeah)

(Hey)
(Yeah)

Seems I can't deny
Some days just don't feel right
I think I feel, I think I feel much better at night
Seems I can't deny
Some days just don't feel right
I think I feel, I think I feel much better at night
Seems I can't deny
Some days just pass me by
You know I feel, I think I feel much better at night
