4 ContributorsQuestion Authority LyricsQuestion authority
Have they the right to say how it should be?
Should one man be able to write it down?
Half the time he can't tell right from wrong
Question authority
Another mans law is not right for me
Another lie to please my sympathy
Another time there will be no pity
This what you want to see?
Is this the way you want things to be?
Things to be
Question authority
I'll pay the price the future belongs to me
This is the time
This is the era
The worlds our dowery
The glory and the power
This is what you want to see?
Is this the way you want things to be?
Things to be
