I got it the hard way
A permanent address to give
I got it for always
Nobody can tear me loose
They tell me there's no escape
On Heartache Avenue
I live alone rent free
There's nothing to pay here
One thing you need to be
If you want to stay here
So lonely you can't pretend
That you're a true resident
Of Heartache Avenue
Leave me alone
Cause I'm here where I belong
I feel at home
On the street where love is gone
It's a hard luck story of Heartache Avenue
There's always room to let
'Cause nobody goes there
One thing you need to get
A ticket to nowhere
No money, no credit card
The price is one broken heart
On Heartache Avenue
You might also likeLeave me alone
'Cause I'm here where I belong
I feel at home
On the street where love is gone
It's a hard luck story of Heartache Avenue
On Heartache Avenue
