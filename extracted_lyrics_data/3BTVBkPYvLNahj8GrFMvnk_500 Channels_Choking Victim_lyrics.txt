15 Contributors500 Channels Lyrics
Five hundred channels of a daydream stimulation
Helps me to resent my life and raise my expectations
Locked into reruns, your memories repeating
And all your ideals seem so self-defeating
For you and yours, the Pepsi generation
And when you're discontent, you change the TV station
And when you hate your life, no qualities redeeming
A million brainwashed zombies will always be heard screaming:

And when there is no hope:
"I smoke some crack; I shoot some dope!"
When there's no enemies:
"I'll sit and stare at my TV!"
And in my ignorance:
"I'll be a slave and sycophant!"

And in a perfect world
Devoid of all temptations
The good leftover crizack
Could unite the nations
But now the war machines
Are mapping our destructions
With poisons overflowing
In the chemical seductions
You might also like
And when there is no hope:
"I smoke some crack; I shoot some dope!"
When there's no enemies:
"I'll sit and stare at my TV!"
And in my ignorance:
"I'll be a slave and sycophant!"

Oh, and when there is no hope:
"I smoke some crack; I shoot some dope!"
When there's no enemies:
"I'll sit and stare at my TV!"
And in my ignorance:
"I'll be a slave and sycophant!"

With my credit and my bank
My mind will draw a blank
I'll block out history
And stare at my TV
For me, there is no way
Five hundred channels waste my life away, away!3Embed
