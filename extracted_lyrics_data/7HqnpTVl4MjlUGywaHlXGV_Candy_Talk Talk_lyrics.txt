8 ContributorsCandy Lyrics
This sure is some kind of party
It's so useful
Surround my life with excuses
For what I choose to lose
And my name doesn't look the same to me
Now now, no no, not me now
And inside
Don't you know I feel so bad, yeah yeah

When I try to turn away
To feel new again
Candy
My emotion cost me pain
Did I look the same?
Candy
When I think about the times
That I laughed away
The idea you'd cheat me
But look again, what'd you say?
"That's my name," yeah

And I hope I've kept you amused
To wipe that spit right off my boots
And when I'm home and thinking in the dark
I hope, I hope, I hope that none of this has had to go too far
When it gets too late
To see me any other way
And it gets so hard to hold on
To everything that I want so bad, yeah yeah
You might also like
Candy
When I try to turn away
To feel new again
Candy
My emotion cost me pain
Did I look the same?
Candy
When I think about the times
That I laughed away
The idea you'd cheat me
But look again, what'd you say?
"That's my name," yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeahEmbed
