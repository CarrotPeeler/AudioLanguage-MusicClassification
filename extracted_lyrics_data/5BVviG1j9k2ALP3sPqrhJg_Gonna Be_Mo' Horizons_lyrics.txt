1 ContributorDa Hallz (Echo) Lyrics
Never got a grip but I gotta learn to let go
"Is it real?" Should've left when you said no
Wasn't free but you're living in my head tho
I don't ever wanna hear your voice echo
Echo through da hallz
Hear 'em echo
Echo through da hallz
Hear 'em echo
Echo through da hallz
I don't wanna hear your voice echo through da hallz

You were never gonna be my only
You just settled for me 'cause you were so lonely
Now I can't say this in DM's 'cause you blocked me
Looking back you were so selfish and was sorry
For thе lies, sorry for the anger
Cut off tiеs, my first time it was with a traitor
I was shy, took advantage. Man I swear I hate her
All the lines taking shots, I don't need a chaser
All the smiles meant nothing, you were just a faker
Gave you space for your mind, but you wanted acres
Didn't care for my life, you just wanted paper
Darkest side in these times now I feel like Vader
See ya later nice guy he is no mo'
Man I swear I'm so sick and tired of being the nice guy fo sho'
I ain't tryna hold myself back for a no show
Celebrating now without you I can go home
You might also like
Never got a grip but I gotta learn to let go
"Is it real?" Should've left when you said no
Wasn't free but you're living in my head tho
I don't ever wanna hear your voice echo
Echo through da hallz
Hear 'em echo
Echo through da hallz
Hear 'em echo
Echo through da hallz
I don't wanna hear your voice echo through da hallz

I don't wanna hear your voice echo through da hallz
I believe you were the one to try to get me to fall
I'm sad that you really didn't support me at all
Now you're looking from the sideline trying to watch how we ball
And I'm holding my station
As I lane switch
Now if you ain't talking bank that is not my language
I remember in the past, I was feeling anguish
Keep the fire in my hands now it's getting dangerous
And nobody wanna rock with me 'cause everybody hated Chris
A brotha had no walls when he was running through the six
Yeah I was an outcast to all the kids
But now I'm doing music everybody find me lit
Now I don't want you here inside my life
And I don't want to have your pain and strife
Goodbye
Never got a grip but I gotta learn to let go
"Is it real?" Should've left when you said no
Wasn't free but you're living in my head tho
I don't ever wanna hear your voice echo
Echo through da hallz
Hear 'em echo
Echo through da hallz
Hear 'em echo
Echo through da hallz
I don't wanna hear your voice echo through da hallz

Checked your page just to see if I really moved on
Couldn't believe it got deleted I feel back with you gone
Now I'm taking off, set sail. I don't need a coupon
Gonna celebrate everyday with a drank
Get a break with sound proof on
I don't care to say what's up
Past 2 years of feeling bummed
Your voice echoed bouncing through da hallz
Started from the base then jumped
From trust issue getting dumped
Saw a child, I grew up
Went from broken down
I'm stronger now that I discovered self love
And now I feel so high, don't need to fly away
You can't hurt me anymore, I learned to fight the pain
Tell myself to use a siren
Thanks to you, I be scared if chicks are lying
Hide the key when I put my heart on lock
Got no time for apologies, I'm working 'round the clock
Driving by your place another date, won't catch me making stops
Now I'm up and away expanding horizons
Then imma get big and then pop
Never got a grip but I gotta learn to let go
"Is it real?" Should've left when you said no
Wasn't free but you're living in my head tho
I don't ever wanna hear your voice echo
Echo through da hallz
Hear 'em echo
Echo through da hallz
Hear 'em echo
Echo through da hallz
I don't wanna hear your voice echo through da hallzEmbed
