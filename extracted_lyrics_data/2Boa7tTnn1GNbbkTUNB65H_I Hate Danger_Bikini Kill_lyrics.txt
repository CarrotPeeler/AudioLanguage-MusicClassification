7 ContributorsI Hate Danger Lyrics
I said, "I wanna come over,"
You said, "Okay, just come over,"
Your friends are all on the couch
Your friends said, "Let's walk around,"

I'll pretend your friends are my friends
And kinda try not to offend them
But I won't let you see anything real
But you know, there's limits too

I stopped talking an hour ago
I stopped talking an hour ago
I stopped talking an hour ago
I stopped talking an hour ago

It's one particular point of view
This group dynamic caters to
It's a predictable point of view
I think you know when it caters to you

And if you do know, don't act like you don't
'Cause it's really annoying
And if you don't know, well, let's just say
You're a lot, lot stupider than I thought
You might also like
I'll pretend your friends are my friends
But I don't wanna hear you defend them
In fact, that kind of insults me
And I kinda don't really wanna be here right

I stopped talking an hour ago
I stopped talking an hour ago
I stopped talking an hour ago
I stopped talking an hour ago, ago

Okay, your whole thing put me in negative space for way too fucking long
The only thing that I managed to say during that time was
"I hate danger,"
What I really should have said was
"You're so not dangerous
You're so not what you say you are at all,"1Embed
