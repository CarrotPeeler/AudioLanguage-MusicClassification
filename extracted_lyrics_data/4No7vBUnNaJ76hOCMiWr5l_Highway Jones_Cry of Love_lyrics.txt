1 ContributorHighway Jones Lyrics
Downtown in the midnight rain
Boys are down on the dead end scene
Came around when I turned 13
Cop a ride on the red machine
Ooh yeah, get it on, get it on
Get it ohh ohh on
Yeah yeah
Yeah yeah

Feelin' the highway jones
Feelin' fine, but it’s alright
Ready to shake my bones
Feelin' the highway jones

On to somethin' that's on to me
Too many places I got to see
Find a way to get what you need, uh-huh
Keep on ridin' on the red machine, yeah
Oh yeah, get it on, get it on
Yeah, yeah
Soon I'll be alright, yeah
You might also like
Feelin' the highway jones
Feelin' fine, but it’s alright
Ready to shake my bones
Feelin' the highway jones
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Oooh, uh-huh
Ooooooh, whoa

Feelin' the highway jones
Feelin' fine, but it’s alright
Ready to shake my bones, yeah
Feelin' the highway jones
Feelin' the highway jones
Feelin' fine, but it’s alright, yeah
Ready to shake, shake, uh
Whoooa, yeah, yeah, yeah!Embed
