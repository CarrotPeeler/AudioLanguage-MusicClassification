I've been lyin', uh huh!
Shot a man, hey! and I stole and ran
Well! Well! we tried to beat 'em
And I lost my freedom
My woman know that I'm in need
So save some of mine for me
If you got to give it up. don't desert me
'Cause leavin' me you know it would hurt me
Snake pits and lucifer burns
Can't take the strength I've earned and learned
Grease, it just ain't greasy
And nasty baby come so easy
Ain't no heaven. ain't no heaven, this devil level
All alone, all alone, all alone, all alone
I get stoned, I get stoned
Saw him pile him in the shower
Hey! Now I plan to be a bad titty sucker
And I plan to stay a black motherfucker
Stepped in depth of the same livin' hell
So I ain't too proud to die here as well
Aw!
Do Do Wap is strong in here
Do Do Wap is strong in here

Check your fears and hope that you're dreamin'
A little space is all that I need
If these suckers just allow me to breathe
My woman's candy makin' him sick
But when I cop there won't be nothin' to lick
Give her some of all the hard, hard pain
Make her achin' body call for my name
My woman know my passion of needs
So save some of mine if you please
If you got to give it up, don't desert me
If you leave me, babe, know it would hurt me, hey!
Do Do Wap is strong in here
Do Do Wap is stro'ng in here
Wakin' up to find yourself creamin'
Check your fears and hope that you're dreamin'
A little space is all that I need
If these suckers just allow me to breathe
Snake pits and lucifers burns
Can't take the strength I've earned and learned
Stepped in depth of the same livin' hell
Ain't too proud to die here as well
Do Do Wap is strong in here
Do Do Wap is strong in here, hey! hey!
Do Do Wap is strong in here
