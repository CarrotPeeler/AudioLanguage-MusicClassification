2 ContributorsYou Are My Joy LyricsThis is love, my darling
There's no denying
In my responses, I was lying
Wherever you were, I wanted to be with you
Lover of my life
So many times
I wanted to be there
Oh darling
Just to be where, wherever you were
I wanted to be there with you
The joining of our hearts
Joining of our hands
And with this ring I thee wed
The love of my life
I'll trust you with my heart, dear
And trust you more when you're not here
And I will be your wife
And I will love you, boy
So much more than the rest, oh yeah
I love you, boy
You are my joy
I love so much more than the rest
You are the king
You are the winner
Ooh, boy, remember that
You are my joy
I love you so much more than the restYou might also likeEmbed
