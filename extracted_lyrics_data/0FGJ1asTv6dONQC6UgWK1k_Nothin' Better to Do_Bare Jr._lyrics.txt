1 ContributorNothinâ€™ Better to Do LyricsI woke up early today
And though of seven different ways
To like myself less than you do
For any reason false or true
While you dig me
More than I dig myself
And I'm in love with you
Cause I got nothin' better to do
Got nothin' better to do
I just fish for sympathy
For any reason pitifully
You smile miles more than I do
So I just bounce me off of you
While you dig me
More than I dig myself
And I'm in love with you
Cause I got nothin' better to do
Got nothin' better to do
There you are giving, here I am taking
Two parasite hearts co-existing
While you dig me
More than I dig myself
And I'm in love with you
Cause I got nothin' better to do
You might also likeYou dig me
More than I dig myself
And I'm in love with you
Cause I got nothin' better to do
Got nothin' better to do
Got nothin' better to do, yeahEmbed
