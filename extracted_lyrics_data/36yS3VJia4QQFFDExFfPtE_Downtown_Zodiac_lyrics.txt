1 ContributorDowntown LyricsRumbling' on your mind
You've been wastin' time
Celebrate your inner state
Captive soul ain't playin' games
One lie won't crush your mind
Bright lights are shining
Big city diamonds
Where are you now?
Bright lights are shining
Big city diamonds
Can you feel it now?
We're going downtown where nobody knows your name
We're going downtown where nobody knows your name
Hookers and hustlers don't seem to care
'Bout your simple life, it ain't fair
You ain't coming' home tonight
So long to your nine to five
Keep on walking', make up your mind
Make up your mind
Bright lights are shining
Big city diamonds
Where are you now?
Bright lights are shining
Big city diamonds
Can you feel it now?
