5 ContributorsAre You Sure LyricsStand up and be a mountain
Power of the dream
The sea, it being a living thing
River, like a hand
Jump up, and be a cloud again
Raining upon the man
Oh, are you sure?
Oh, are you sure?
Oh, are you sure?
You just might fall in love
Power of the dream
Stand up and be a mountain
The sea, it being a living thing
River, like a hand
Jump up, and be a cloud again
Raining upon the man
Oh, are you sure?
Oh, are you sure?
Oh, are you sure?
