8 ContributorsJust Got Paid Lyrics
Just got paid today
Got me a pocket full of change
Said, I just got paid today
Got me a pocket full of change
If you believe like working hard all day
Just step in my shoes and take my pay

I was born my papa's son
When I hit the ground I was on the run
I had one glad hand and the other behind
You can have yours, just give me mine
When the hound dog barking in the black of the night
Stick my hand in my pocket, everything's all right

I just got paid today
Got me a pocket full of change
Said, black sheep black
Do you got some wool?
Yes, I do, man, my bag is full
It's the root of evil and you know the rest
But it's way ahead of what's second bestSee ZZ Top LiveGet tickets as low as $68You might also like1Embed
