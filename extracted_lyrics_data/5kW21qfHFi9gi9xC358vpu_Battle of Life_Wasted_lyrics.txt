3 ContributorsLife Blood LyricsI have seen a picture of hate, formed in a thousand ways
People say it's all too late, talking of numbered days
In a time of pain and strife, in time of all your tears
Fight a battle of your life, think of the wasted years
Can you see a reason for it?
I don't want this waiting for me
There is love behind your eyes, waiting for you to give
Love and hate, you realize, which do you want to live?
Do you want the blood of my life, hear now my cries above
Don't try to hide yourself, behind those female lines
When you finally found the answer
Will you want me for all time?
I have seen a picture of hate, formed in a thousand ways
People say it's all too late, talking of numbered days
In a time of pain and strife, in time of all your tears
Fight a fight for the right, think of the wasted years
Can you see a reason for it?
I don't want this waiting for meYou might also likeEmbed
