9 ContributorsHead Static Lyrics
Yeah, I write songs about myself all the time, Ha!
And... whatever
(In my head, In my head, In my head)
If you could you would , wouldn't you?
(In my head, In my head, In my head)
You would, I know you would
(In my head, In my head, In my head)
Always I've been

Whenever I walk, it's on pins and needles
I can't go a day without offending people, no
Especially pretentious people
Pretending feeble, defending evil
I wanna to go to Heaven just to fuck a angel
I said it to myself while I was busing tables
Walking through that restaurant drunken, unstable
Fucking unable to cut the cable
Of the mainstream playlist on repeat, shuffle
I spit heinous, so all I need's Hustle
I get acquainted and involved with each muscle
Now I'm feeling super saiyan, evolving through each struggle
The old me said the new me was too free
The new me said the old me was 2d
Transparent and too weak
I got to kill them both in two weeks to do me
Truly no lie
So I make a hater bunch up in the middle like a fucking bow tie
Cause I won't die
They don't know why
Like the twenty-fifth letter
Have you ever met 'em?
Hell no I ain't sweatin' it
Just spitting my messages for Blacks, Whites, Koreans and Mexicans
And whoever else is living in Los Angeles
Repping my residence, sending my sentiments
Everyone's invited
As long they're not lying about enlightenment
Well, I'm delighted
My name's MC NoCanDo, nice to meet you
I got a dope flow, you ought ta try the entire baby
You might also like
I think I'm going crazy
My focus getting hazy
I might be kind of, maybe
Because all I hear is static
In my head, in my head
In my head, head, head
In my head, in my head
In my head, head, head
I tell them that they act so smart but they don't know shit
They act so smart but they don't know shit
They act so smart but they don't know shit
They act so smart but they don't know shit

I just want to do a selfish act
And be the Michael Phelps of rap
I ain't talking about selling crack
Or complaining about the plight of helpless blacks
I just want to affect your life
Crash your party, respect your wife
Young Ralph Ellison, camouflage skeleton
Transparent melanin, clever as I ever been
Feral and intelligent, devilish and Heaven-sent
(What else?) And several different delineatives
Bitch, you know my steez
No tricks, no gimmicks, check both my sleeves
The facial expression on my old ID
Oh it's cool and it's rich as a cold night breeze
In my old Nike's and my old white tee's
I direct this scene cause I'm so Spike Lee
Maybe even Paul Haggis
The fact is, Los Angeles, we're all crashing
Smog traffic, mall madness, fall fashion, ah, raw savage
Incred amounts of violence, overindulgence
And drugs and vaginas, we got it to a science
We'll loot any appliance in an act of defiance
Don't act like I'm lying (Riots!)
They used to smoke Angel Dust
I think that's what made 'em so dangerous
Motherfucker don't play with us
You'll only enable us to go crazy
Go crazy 
Crazy!
