1 ContributorWho’s Been Fooling You (1953) LyricsTell me pretty baby
Who’s been fooling you?
I wanna get you straight honey
I don’t like the way you do
To me you look so sad and lonesome
Have your lover put you down?
To me you look so sad and lonesome
Have your lover put you down?
Twas you needing help baby
You are the saddest girl in town
I can see your clothes all raggedy
And your feets need shoesing
 drink or gamble
That’s why you look so bluesy
Tell me pretty baby
Is everything alright?
If you don’t see me this evening
Dig me tomorrow night

I know it hurts you baby
But I’ve gotta kill for you
What’s gonna make you happy
Is a man that’s really true
You might also likeTell me pretty baby
Who’s been fooling you?
If we can get together
I could make your dreams come trueEmbed
