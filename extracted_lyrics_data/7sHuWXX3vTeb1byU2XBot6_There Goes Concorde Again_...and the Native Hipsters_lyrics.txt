2 ContributorsThere Goes Concorde Again LyricsOutside fat women struggle up the hill
Bright red cardigans over printed dresses
Handbags ruthlessly under the arm
Occasionally a thin version lopes down
Pulling a shopping basket
What do they do down there
That results in such an increase in size and weight?
Sometimes two meet, they both look down the hill
From a high window through net curtains
You can see the lip and hand movements
Perhaps nothing happens down the hill
Perhaps its pure coincidence that
When I glance out I always see
Fat women walk up and thin walk down
Oh look, there goes Concorde again
Oh look, there goes Concorde againYou might also likeEmbed
