6 ContributorsThis Is Compton Lyrics
Fresh off the streets from the underground
Nick-named MC Eiht, black brother gets down
Came to dazzle with the hip-hop funk
To let em know (This is Compton) Now what's up, punk
Westside rulin all world cause I dump
And the city that I'm from take no shit from a chump
Niggas don't care if their enemy's beefin
Pretty soon it's a homie you're grievin
You entered the criminal zone
If you're just a little punk-ass fool, you should run on home
Try to compare? Get real
I'm from Compton, so you should know the deal
Ballers, skeezers, no age limit matters
Loced-out muthafuckas make the one time scatter
Toe to toe, draw my mic and start dumpin
It's the down MC Eiht, and fool, this is Compton
(This is Compton)

Another crazy nigga from the city
Chill's from the C-p-t, you got beef? What a pity
I don't play, cause I slay all rap suckers
Down with E, killin rookie muthafuckas
Squabbin in the streets, with the left you fall
Make a right on Alondra, see my name on the wall
Not like the banger, but I bust up
(Any punk-ass fool that'll step up)
So follow me into the zone they call panic
Hubs by the dub, but suckers act frantic
Niggas rollin hard, number one on the pop
Crazy brothers goin out all for the gangbang, stop
Compton is thumpin, suckers we stompin
Rhymes on hit, but they still talk shit
I gives a fuck about a fool who's frontin
They call me Tha Chill, and yo, this is Compton
You might also like(This is Compton)
(Say it louder)
(Louder)
(Who's playing all that damn loud-ass music out there?)
(Compton's Most Wanted, punk, rollin four deep)
(Who's playing all that damn loud-ass music out there?)
(Eiht'll get crazy, kill like the Terminator)
(Who's playing all that damn loud-ass music out there?)
(Boy, hold up, Tha Chill's on the stage)
(Who's playing all that damn loud-ass music out there?)
(I plays the drums, the SP-1200)
(Eiht is back again with power after hour)
(Tha Chill is ready, so pass me the sack)

Compton is the city that I'm claimin
Hardcore fact with the gat, to the punks I start gamin
Devious, so what do you expect?
I'm from the city on missions, and I pop your fuckin neck
People understand what I'm sayin
Talk more shit, I'm on hit, keep the fools all payin
Niggas make the scale when they bail
Police punks talk shit, but you still get out of jail
Eiht represents the place with the bass
The beat you won't beat, you're just a disgrace
Try to be casual, but that shit won't work
Get sweated in a minute, cause they down for the dirt
Maximum capacity, the crowd just jumps
For the rhythm that I give em, make the souls all pump
Energetic, so don't forget it, yeah, the Eiht keeps pumpin
And fool, this is Compton
(This is Compton)
(Commpton)

Punk muthafucka, Tha Chill will destroy ya
With the dope hub style for ya
Bein that you're just another fan on the tip
Get dropped by Eiht, Ant, Bam, and Slip
Suckers better watch out, Chill's here to scrap
As I say it everytime in my muthafuckin rap
Just like a warzone got my territory marked
You be slippin if you're caught in the dark
(Sorry clown) Don't be slippin
Don't go head up with Tha Chill
Cause Chill can kill
I can't stop because the city I'm from
I get too fucked up, and kick the ass of a bum
So if you got static, punk keep frontin
Yo E, they know where the fuck we from
Yo, this is Compton

You sorry-ass muthafuckas can't deal
Especially you sucker-ass D-V-3 muthafuckas
Geah
Y'all muthafuckas is too crazy
If y'all think y'all can hang with Compton's muthafuckin Most Wanted
In effect
Youknowmsayin
For '89 straight to the 9-0, fool
Sucker-ass niggas
Can't fade us
C.M.W
Punk-ass perm-wearin pussies
Ha-ha-ha
Yeah I like that shit
Faggot-ass
Shit, I'm about pissed off, man
Hey Ant, let's get the fuck out of hereEmbed
