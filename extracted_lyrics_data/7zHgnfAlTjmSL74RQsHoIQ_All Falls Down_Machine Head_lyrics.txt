4 ContributorsAll Falls Down LyricsAnticipating
Salivating
Intoxicating
How I've been waiting
To gently soak in
Your dream that's broken
Caress my hands around your throat when
I choke the last gasp of air out of you
I'll mesmerize you
Hypnotize you
Paralyze you
My snake-eyes blind you
My gentlest tickle
My tenderest prickle
The back of your neck
I stab icicles
My sweetest grin
Will pull you in
Behind that grin, a razor-teeth smile
Under your bed
Inside your head
I am the monster in wait
Walk, run, I'm the fear you've become
Pray, hope before it's your
Downfall
And all falls
Down!

Victimize you
My false pretenses
Endear me to you
I'm psychopathic
Psychosomatic
Believe everything
You've heard about me
Ate you alive
Since you were a child
That's when the monster first appeared to you
So know my name
What is my name?
My name is fear, and I'm you
Walk, run, I'm the fear you've become
Pray, hope, before it's your
Downfall
And all falls
Down
Down
With faith I crawl
In sadness I fear what I've become
'Cause after all
I'm acting pretend my smile on
Before the fall
The pain washes over
Hold on
Hold on
Survive
Survive
This
Whoa!
Whoa!
(Walk!) Walk (run!) run, I'm the fear you've become
(Fight!) Fight (back!) now before it's your
Downfall
And all falls
Downfall
And all falls
Down!
