3 ContributorsDarkhangel Lyrics
Majestic light of Baphomet
O formless laughing one
Whose might unmarred the maker's mind unmade
Shine forth upon this acolyte
As one with me become
Let the flames of Lilith claim those God betrayed

"O Masters of Dimensions, thou unsleeping lords of sin
From lade of sulphur's fiery void where demons dwell within."

From thy kingdom will come
Read the rites, cast the spell
Call the chaos lords of Hell
Son of Caim, Orobas, Shub-Niggurath, Beelzebub, Haagenti, Astaroth
Let the earth begin to burn

And all things will come to be, when the spirit is flesh
Mine the magic, the mystery
Till he comes
Rise from out of destitution
Through pain I rise above
Soon will come the restitution of our love
You might also like
I have walked the ways to other worlds
I see what none have seen
The union of opposites foretell
A life unchained through knowledge gained has sanctified my dream
With prayers arcane, I raise the Darkhangel

"O patriarch of parallels, in vales of slumbering sin
The candle, hell, the book compel, all demons welcome in"

Through thy kingdom will come
Read the rites, cast the spell, call the chaos Lords of Hell
Barbatos, Orias, Amdusias, Naberius, Ipos, Valac, Zagan
Let the Earth begin to burn

All commandments be cast away
Here where fears are all passed away
All commandments be cast away

To this kingdom we come
Read the rites, cast the spell, call the chaos Lords of Hell
Agares, Vapula, Marchosias, Samigina, Vine, Sitir, Beleth
Let the earth begin to burn
And all things will come to be, when the spirit is flesh
Mine the magic, the mystery
Till he comes
From out of destitution
Through pain I rise above
Will come the restitution of our love

I've travelled through time's portal, supra mortal have become
This night of Pan, I greet thee as a friend
I decades yearned for your return, to see thy death undone
What fools abhorred, endured I to the end
Endured I to the end

Speak to me now in tongues of angels
Life devourer, wisdom giver
Through the vision, through the voice, through the veil, thyself deliver
Speak to me now in tongues of angels
Life devourer, wisdom giver
Through the vision, through the voice, through the veil, thyself deliver
Rise, Rise, Rise, Rise
(Rise) From out of destitution
(Rise) Through pain I rise above
(Rise) Will come the restitution of our love
Into my loneliness comes the sound of a flute in dim groves that haunt the uttermost hills
Even from the brave river they reach to the edge of the wilderness
And I behold Pan1Embed
