2 ContributorsCruise Control LyricsSinking
I'm sinking deeper every day
I don't care, I don't care
Seems to me it's time to taste
Some different air, get out of here
Caught up in the routines
Really nothing much to lose
So risk it all and just cut loose
Put your life in cruise control
Set your course and let it go
And you might find a better way
Tomorrow's looking pretty grey
Say a prayer, 'cause I've been there
About as welcome as acid rain
So do you dare? Get out of here
Never take a look back
Never say that it's too late
Pull the plug on yesterday
Put yourself in cruise control
Set your course and let it go
And you might just find a better way
You might also likeNever take a look back, never say that it's too late
Step on the gas, accelerate
Choking
