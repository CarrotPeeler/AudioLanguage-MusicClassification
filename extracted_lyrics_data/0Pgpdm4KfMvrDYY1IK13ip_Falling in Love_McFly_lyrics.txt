11 ContributorsFalling in Love Lyrics
Everyday feels like a Monday
There is no escaping from the heartache
Now I wanna put it back together
'Cause it's always better late than never
Wishing I could be in California
I wanna tell you when I call you
I could have fallen in love
I wish I'd fallen in love

Out of our minds and out of time
Wishing I could be with you
To share the view

We could have fallen in love
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh

Waking up to people talking
And it's getting later every morning
Then I realize it's nearly mid-day
And I've wasted half my life, don't throw it away
Saying everyday should be a new day
To make you smile and find a new way
I'd have fallen in love
I could have fallen in love

Out of our minds and out of time
Wishing I could be with you
To share the view

Oh, we could have fallen in love
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
We could've fallen in love
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh

(Sick of waiting, I can't take it, gotta tell ya
Sick of waiting, I can't take it, gotta tell ya)
I can't take another night on my own
So I take a breath and then I pick up the phone
She said oh...
(Sick of waiting, I can't take it, gotta tell ya
Sick of waiting, I can't take it, gotta tell ya)
She said oh...
(Sick of waiting, I can't take it, gotta tell ya
Sick of waiting, I can't take it, gotta tell ya)
She said oh...
(Sick of waiting, I can't take it, gotta tell ya)
We could have fallen in love
(Sick of waiting, I can't take it, gotta tell ya)
She said oh...
(Sick of waiting, I can't take it, gotta tell ya)
Oh, we could have fallen in love
(Sick of waiting, I can't take it, gotta tell ya)
Oh, we could have fallen in love
(Sick of waiting, I can't take it, gotta tell ya)
Yeah, we could have fallen in love
(Sick of waiting, I can't take it, gotta tell ya)
She said oh...
(Sick of waiting, I can't take it, gotta tell ya)
Oh, we could have fallen in love
(Sick of waiting, I can't take it)
I wish I'd fallen in loveEmbed
