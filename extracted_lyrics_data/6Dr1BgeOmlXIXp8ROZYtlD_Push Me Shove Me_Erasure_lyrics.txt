Push me, push me
Over
Push me, push me


Push me, shove me (Push me)
I don't call that love me
I call that over

Motion always seemed to me the way I ought to go
No one now gets in my way, I won't let my heartache show
The same situation won't bring me down no more
I'll get on without you now, I don't need your help for sure

Push me, shove me (Push me)
I don't call that love me
I call that over

There was once a time when I would fall for all your lies
Now I know the game you played, I see it clearly in your eyes
You can't cry beside me, I won't let you in my heart
I can walk out on my own, it's high time we moved apart
You might also like
Push me, shove me (Push me, push me)
I don't call that love me
Push me, shove me (Push me, push me)
I don't call that love me
Call that over


You say talk it out, I say it's all one big mistake
Cut so deep it's hard and it's the chance I have to take
I don't need to follow, I want to face love on my own
Emotion, oh, emotion, from now on that's how it goes

Push me, shove me (Push me, push me)
I don't call that love me
Call that over
Push me, shove me (Push me, push me)
I don't call that love me
Push me, shove me (Push me, push me)
I don't call that love me
Call that over
Call that over
Call that over
Call that overEmbed
