1 ContributorObjects In Motion LyricsObjects in motion, tend to stay that way
You can't waste the whole damn day loving what you need to cast away
Case in point, just yesterday I found
A suitcase full of love letters floating down a cool brown river
Unsigned and undelivered
They set my mind to wandering
As to the history of the unknown writer
Did she marry? Did she run? Was she old? Was she young?
Was her heart undone by the cruel business of loving?
These objects in motion
These objects in motion
Objects in motion tend to stay that way
Or so I learned on the riverbank just yesterday
For shortly thereafter, I beheld as if in a dream
The body of a young girl adrift beneath the surface of the cool brown water
My friends so unnerved was I
By this cruel apparition
That I let loose of that suitcase and it tumbled right back in the river
Then spellbound I watched as a halo of love letters
Formed a circle on the surface of the water right over her body and drifted away
These objects in motion
These objects in motion
You might also likeObjects in motion tend to stay that way
You can't waste the whole damn day loving what you need to cast away
For from the flame of love
Comes the cinder of regret
Sometimes the thing you cling to most is the thing you'd best forget
These objects in motion
These objects in motionEmbed
