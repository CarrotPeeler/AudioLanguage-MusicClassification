A song along while we drink
A thinking song, a drinking song
For the ship we're on sinks
Lo life is short and life is sad
So let's carouse – we'll pretend we're glad
What so care we of some woe and hurt?
Girls let us come raise our skirts!
Oh men regale how our voices meld
For drink and song make a pretty pair
Shall you sing along aloud along -
To my itty bitty drinking song?
Yea, sing and drink with me
Yo ho oh oh
Yo ho oh oh
Oh do lo da lo da li
Oh do lo da lo da lie
Whilst our beauty fades
They dig our graves and
And some wicked end rushes right this way
How silly to fret, now let us a forget
For what's to apprehend-
Except  for wasted days
Yes! Take a glass and laugh a laugh . Ha!
And let it splash in death's wretched visage
Sing and drink with me…
