1 ContributorMoment Of Truth LyricsChorus
You came into my life
And you made it all happen
You gave something good
You gave naturally
And nothing can change
The love that we started
It's a moment of truth
You always have been a true friend of mine
I never thought that we would cross that line
You kept on pushing my heart - trying to open my soul
And now here we are - and I...I can see you in a brand new light
And suddenly loving you feels so right
Repeat Chorus
I can be myself and I can speak my mind
I can't believe your love was here all the time
You feel like heaven on earth
And now I'm ready to give you the love you deserve
We wil go on 'n' on 'n' on...and no matter what
Heh baby, I'm gonna share with you all that I've got
Repeat Chorus
And you....you gave something that I never had
Something so special - I'll never forget
You might also likeYou're the love of my life
And I know what I feel
I can hardly believe that this moment's for real
You came into my life and you made love come true
And now I realize - all I wanted was you
And nothing can change the love that we started
It's a moment of truth
Special Chorus
You came into my life
And you made me feel so good
I don't know what I want
And I don't know what I should
Do without the love that we started
It's a change for the goodEmbed
