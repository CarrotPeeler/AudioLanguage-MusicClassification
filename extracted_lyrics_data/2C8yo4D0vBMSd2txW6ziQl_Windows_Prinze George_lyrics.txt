1 ContributorWindows LyricsYou’re just a phone call far away
Tell me to go or ask me to stay
I can’t decide where my feet prefer to meet me
On a Westbound bus of strangers
Or steadfast by your side
Your words are lived in funny and wise
And on occasion I’ve seen you rise
Beneath a rosy colored sunset
Smiling softly on the fervor of our lives
Its seems the time for leaving’s when I’m finally close to comfort
I’m sitting at the airport feeling sorry for myself
Home you’re many Windows
Many exits many floors
Go it’s good to grow girl
So long as you remember yours
OoohhhhEmbed
