6 ContributorsFoolish Lyrics
Do ya, do ya, do ya, do ya?
Do ya, do ya, do ya, do ya?
Will ya, will ya, will ya, will ya?
Come on, come on, come on home
Tonight?

It's the way that you move
Into my heart
It's the way that I move out

Yeah, ow
Yeah, ow
You brought too much
Too much metaphor to the
Relationship
To what I see
To how I kiss
Yuck
Yeah, ow
I'm hating what I'm feeling but I'm
So foolishly attracted to you
You
You might also like
Baby you had me doubt all that I knew
Hey you
Can we move on?

Yeah, ow
Yeah, ow
You brought too much
Too much metaphor to the
Relationship
To what I see
To how I kiss
Yuck
Yeah, ow
I'm hating what I'm feeling but I'm
So foolishly attracted to you
You

Foolishly attracted
So foolishly attracted
So foolishly attracted to youEmbed
