1 ContributorEyes of Dazzling Bright LyricsSleepin in your bed
All the pores are shoutin
Like minstrels lost on wasteland wide
Recalling all the words
Told by thick and blind-fold
Unwanted stars
Deep into the gray
Little subtle spies
Have coloured creep into delight
Then seats turn hot seats
They won't stop talking
Until your star's falling
Star's falling
They're so hungry
With eyes of dazzlin bright
They're so hungry
Can't tell you why
They're so hungry
With eyes of dazzling bright
They're so hungry
But why should IYou might also likeEmbed
