Well See, See See Rider
Just-a see what you have a-done
Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, See See Rider
See what you have a-done, hah-hah
Well, you made me a-love you
And now your girl has come
What'd I say?

Well, I'm gonna buy (See See Rider)
Me a shotgun (See See Rider)
Just as long as I am tall (See See Rider)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Catch me a shotgun (See See Rider)
Just as long as I am tall (See See Rider)
What'd I say? (See See Rider)

Well, I'll shoot a-my a-baby, ha
Then, I'll a-catch that Cannonball (See See Rider)
Oh-ho-ho, yeah (See See Rider)


Well, I'm goin' (See See Rider)
Away, baby (See See Rider)
And I won't (See See Rider) be back (See See Rider)
Until fall (See See Rider)
No, no, no, no
I'm goin' away, baby (See See Rider)
And I won't be back (See See Rider) 'til fall (See See Rider)
What'd I say? (See See Rider)

If I find me a good man
Your baby a-won't be back at all (See See Rider)
What'd I say? (See See Rider)

I said See (See See Rider)
See See Rider (See See Rider)
Oh, See (See See Rider)
See See Rider (See See Rider)
Whoa, yeah, yeah (See See Rider)Embed
