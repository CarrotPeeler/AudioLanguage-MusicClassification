Need all my money
(Uh) I want all my cash
I need all my money

And you can lea' yo ass

(Oh-oh)
She said it was her cousin (Oh-oh)
All along, that nigga was her man (Oh-oh)
Played me like Disneyland
Dolla duck, I took a hit like contraband (Yeah) (Oh-oh)
Seen all the warnings (Oh-oh)
Damn near showed all the signs (Oh-oh)
I was looking for some party time
The wrong bitch showed up, make ya talk about her

Out to rob me, don't mess with a loaded gun (Oh-oh)
Y'all niggas tryna have some fun
She only love me
I throw five thousand ones, up
See, that's bad for business (Oh-oh)
That's what I had 'ta learn (Oh-oh)
And that's what she got to learn
I ain't going no where for your concern, girl

Til I start breaking bread (Oh-oh)
Reminiscing on the girl I met
Ooh, ooh back and forth until she came corrected (Oh-oh)

Got every nigga with a figure, got me jumping the gun
