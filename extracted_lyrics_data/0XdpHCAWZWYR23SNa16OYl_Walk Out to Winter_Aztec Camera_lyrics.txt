Walk out to winter
Swear I'll be there
Chill will wake you
High and dry, you'll wonder why

We met in the summer and walked 'til fall
And breathless we talked, it was tongues
Despite what they'll say
It wasn't youth, we'd hit the truth
Faces of Strummer that fell from your wall
And nothing was left where they hung
So sweet and bitter
They're what we found so drink them down and

Walk out to winter
Swear I'll be there
Chill will wake you
High and dry, you'll wonder why
Walk out to winter
Swear I'll be there
Chance is buried
Just below the blinding snow
You might also like
You burn in the breadline
And ribbons and all
So walk to winter
You won't be late, you'll always wait
This generation
The walk to the wall
But I'm not angry
Get your gear, get out of here and

Walk out to winter
Swear I'll be there
Chill will wake you
High and dry, you'll wonder why
Walk out to winter
Swear I'll be there
Chance is buried
Just below the blinding snow


Walk out to winter
Swear I'll be there
Chill will wake you
High and dry, you'll wonder why
Walk out to winter
Swear I'll be there
You'll find snowblind
This is life, this is life1Embed
