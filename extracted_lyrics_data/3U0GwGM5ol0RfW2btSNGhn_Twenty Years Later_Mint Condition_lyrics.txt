1 ContributorTwenty Years Later LyricsStole my momma's TV
And DVD (Player)
To get what I need
To feel
A little
(Better)
Married my best friend's wife
So cold
I never thought twice
Maybe not the best thing I've done
In my life
I wonder
Why my life hasn't changed
Twenty years later
Still
Doin the same thing
What if my friends
Ever needed me
I'd be there for them
As long as it's not money
Or, an ex-girlfriend
One of my boy's
Got me a good, good job
And I needed to borrow some monеy
Ain't called him at all
It's kinda like I left town
You might also likeNow I'm with anothеr friend's ex
Told her she can't call
He's my roommate
Would be drama
But really I'm married, just turned 47
And now I'm back here with my mother
I wonder
Why my life hasn't changed
Twenty years later
Still
Doin the same things
I wonder
Why my life hasn't changed
Twenty years later
Still
Doin the same things
I wonder
Why my life hasn't changed
Twenty years later
Still
Doin the same things
I need to change
So my life can change
I need to change
Got all this pain
Please God help me be a man of my word
Cause I'm hurtin so...
My brothers think I'm lazy
Cause I'm living off my mom (my mom)
They think I need, need a job
They don't understand that I already have a job (a job)
I take some friends I'm praying I'm not...
I wonder
Why my life hasn't changed (hasn't changed)
Twenty years later
Still
Doin the same things
I wonder
Why my life hasn't changed
Twenty years later
Still
Doin the same thingsEmbed
