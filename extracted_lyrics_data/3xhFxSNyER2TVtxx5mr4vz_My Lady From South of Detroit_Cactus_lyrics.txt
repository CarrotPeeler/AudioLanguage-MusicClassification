4 ContributorsMy Lady From South of Detroit LyricsThere's a love that I dream of at night
When I'm home by the fireside of thought
After her, all the rest don't seem right
You should feel all the goodness she brought
If you're wondering just who she could be (Ooh)
Well, I promise I'd not say her name
If you settle down here alongside me (Ooh)
I will tell you, 'cause I'm not ashamed
She's my lady from south of Detroit
And we met quite a few years ago
I remember her beauty her taste, and her charms (Ah)
Oh, how could I forget holdin' her in my arms?
My lady from south of Detroit
And even though some think she's bad
I'm so sorry she's gone, 'cause a memory lives on (Ah)
She's the best lover I've ever had
She's my lady from south of Detroit
And we met quite a few years ago
I remember her beauty, her taste, and her charms (Ah)
Oh, how could I forget holding her in my arms?
My lady from south of Detroit
And even though some think she's bad
I'm so sorry she's gone, 'cause a memory lives on (Ah)
She's the best lover I've ever had
Oh, the best lover I've ever had
Oh, my lady (Where are you now?)
