I don’t do yoga, never tried pilates
Not many people want me at their parties
Tryna find my place, some place, oh I, oh I, oh I
I drink a little more than recommended
This world ain’t exactly what my heart expected
Tryna find my way someway, oh I, oh I, oh I

See, whoa, c’est la vie
Maybe something’s wrong with me
But, whoa, at least I am free, I am free

If you ask the church then I am no believer
Spend Sundays asleep I'm just another dreamer
Still tryna find my home sweet home, oh I, oh I, oh I
I guess I ain’t too good for money either
I got two left feet, no, I'm no Jackson neither
Just tryna find my way someway, oh I, oh I, oh I

See, whoa, c’est la vie
Maybe something’s wrong with me
But, whoa, at least I am free, oh, oh, I am free
Yeah, whoa, c’est la vie
Maybe something’s wrong with me
But, whoa, at least I am free, oh, oh, I am free

Yeah, I'm free, yeah, I'm free
Yeah, I'm free, yeah, I'm free
Yeah, I'm free, yeah, I'm free
Just tryna find my home sweet home, sweet home, sweet home, sweet home
Yeah, I'm free, yeah, I'm free
Yeah, I'm free, yeah, I'm free
I drink a little more than recommended (Yeah, I'm free, yeah, I'm free)
'Cause this ain’t exactly what my heart expected (Yeah, I'm free, yeah, I'm free)
Yeah, I'm free, yeah, I'm free
Yeah, I'm free, yeah, I'm free

Whoa, c’est la vie
Maybe something’s wrong with me
But whoa, at least
I am free, oh, oh, I am free
Whoa, c’est la vie
Maybe something’s wrong with me
But, whoa, at least
I am free, oh, oh, I am free
Whoa, c’est la vie
Maybe something’s wrong with me
Whoa, at least I am free, oh, oh, I am free
Whoa, c’est la vie
Maybe something’s wrong with me
Whoa, at least I am free, oh, oh, I am free
