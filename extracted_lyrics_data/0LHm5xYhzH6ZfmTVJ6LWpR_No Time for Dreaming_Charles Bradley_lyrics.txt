No time for dreaming (Dreaming, dreaming)
Gotta get on up (Get up) and do my thing (Woo)
No time for dreaming (Dreaming, dreaming)
Gotta get on up (Get up) and do my thing (And do your thing)

Dream while your sleeping
Tired of slowly creeping
Open up your eyes
Before it's too late
Try a little harder
Stop wasting over yonder
Wake up
You'll get your break

No time for dreaming (Dreaming, dreaming)
Gotta get on up (Get up), gotta do my thing (Woo)
No time for dreaming (Dreaming, dreaming)
Gotta get on up (Get up), gotta do my thing (And do your thing)

While your sleeping
Somebody's scheming
Try to getta
What I got
Stay alert
It's got to work
Or you end up
On the spot

No time for dreaming (Dreaming, dreaming)
Gotta get on up (Get up) and do my thing (Woo)
No time for dreaming (Dreaming, dreaming)
Gotta get on up (Get up) and do my thing (And do your thing)
(And do your thing)


No time for dreaming (Dreaming, dreaming)
Gotta make it real (Yeah), gotta do my thing (Woo)
No time for sleeping (Sleeping, sleeping), no time for creeping
Gotta make it right, gotta do my thing (And do your thing)

You gotta do your thing
Oh yeah, I mean it, come one
You gotta do your thing
I, I, I, oh
You gotta do your thing1Embed
