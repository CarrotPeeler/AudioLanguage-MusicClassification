1 Contributor(Bonus) Overnight Success Lyrics(Omari Talking)
I mean this shit is really different
Soon as the beat come in you feel the vibes and all that shit
Really don't think niggas could be fucked with, that's a Fendi
Yeah

(Verse 1 - Omari M'$)
She don't fuck with lames
Put her on a plane
Attitude is crazy, ain't a chick that can be tamed
And she ain't on the scene so no, she ain't in to fame
Stilettoes running through my mind, wine, finer than champagne
Took me out to brunch and I could see it in her eyes
Lobster mac n cheese, with ease I'm creepin up her thighs
Smoke a blunt up in the front, she rollin' weed like I ain't fried
She tell me I'm The Don, she know it help me sleep at night
We creepin' like some mice, we hit a lick inside the safe
Brought it to my shorty put the bread up on her plate
You could spend the night, fuck it, we could catch a flight
The way things lookin' I should raise my feature price
Jasmine on my rice, Jasmine lookin' nice
If Jasmine got a man I'm bouta push him to the side
Cause Jasmine on my mind, I'm thinkin' Jasmine all the time
Money plus the diamonds I got karats on my mind
You might also likeIt'll probably be this way until they put me in a pine
Hall of Fame Don they should put me in a shrine
Nigga, I don't need a Lam, I'm eatin' lamb up in the Lyft
Hit the driver with a tip, and he let me spark a spliff, damn
Moonwalk on the track, a young Michael Jack
Yatta said I'm gettin' better so let's toast to that
Tom Ford shades and I got cologne to match
I never sold a sack but copped a couple quarterbacks

(Hook - Omari M'$)
These niggas hella thirsty
Ballin' like I'm Curry
Back up in my bag, that's a fact you should be worried
Do this shit with ease so I could do this in a hurry
Every time I rap it's like a beat is gettin' burried
This shit perfected, youngin lookin' like the prototype
See me, keep it pimpin' playa I ignore the hype
Never runnin' out of bars cause I got more to write
This shit perfected cause I'm workin, wasn't overnight
(Verse 2 - Thommy Propane)
White glove, niggas been involved with the environments
Black love if niggas owe me paper they could wire it
Pretty bitch wanna suck my dick in its entirety
Fucked her in the cockpit she never seen a flyer nigga
You is not a boss my worker niggas could hire niggas
I know what it cost the devil couldn't even fire niggas
I do not desire bitches, I design them bitches
I could really redefine them niggas, I'm a timeless nigga
She said I'm a palm angel, I'm more like a long ranger
Diamonds on me cold glacier, my young bitch got no patience
We got work in Indiana, I feel like a whole pacer
Said she wanna fuck me now, told the bitch to call me later
We don't lay down like dogs, that ain't my pedigree
Bro dont lay down at all, he shoot to heavenly
I be with The Gods, playing the odds where the reverend be
I simplify complexities, its hard for me to let it be

(Hook - Omari M'$)
These niggas hella thirsty
Ballin' like I'm Curry
Back up in my bag, that's a fact you should be worried
Do this shit with ease so I could do this in a hurry
Every time I rap it's like a beat is gettin' burried
This shit perfected, youngin lookin' like the prototype
See me, keep it pimpin' playa I ignore the hype
Never runnin' out of bars cause I got more to write
This shit perfected cause I'm workin, wasn't overnightEmbed
