8 ContributorsPDA Lyrics
PDA, yeah
Printz Board on the beat
PDA

Intimate scenes
Fresh from my dreams
Over triple X movie screen
I could care less about being seen
High self esteem with you and me
(Ain't that the way it's s'posed to be?)
I say, baby, do you think?
Sugar so sweet, should'a rot my teeth
Instead it just rottens me, spoiled crazy

Public display of affection
(Gotta make 'em)
Pointin' in our direction
(Watch 'em, watch 'em)
Public display of affection
Makes them wish they had it this way

We be at the club, the restaurant
The grocery store, the movies
Kissing and touching
With my hands all over your booty
Wherever it is, we is, I love it truly
Your PDA-A-A (I want your PDA)
Your PDA-A-A (I want your PDA)
Your PDA-A-A (I want your PDA)
You might also like
Remember at the beach, we brought the sheets
And we were harassed by police?
Good thing we didn't go too deep
Everywhere we be the passion in me just screams
I just need you in my reach, yeah, yeah
Baby your suspense can be intense
It's got me convinced, oh yeah
You're the fingers to my instrument

Public display of affection
(Gotta make them)
Pointin' in our direction
(Watch 'em, watch 'em)
Public display of affection
Makes them wish they had it this way

We be at the club, the restaurant
The grocery store, the movies
Kissing and touching
With my hands all over your booty
Wherever it is, we is, I love it truly
Your PDA-A-A (I want your PDA)
Your PDA-A-A (I want your PDA)
Your PDA-A-A (I want your PDA)
Your PDA-A-A, your PDA-A-A
(I want your PDA)
From the lobby to the patio
(Boy you so crazy)
And we're so compatible
From the Starbucks to the Navajo
(Hmm, you nasty)
And we're so compatible

We be at the club, the restaurant
The grocery store, the movies
Kissing and touching
With my hands all over your booty
Wherever it is, we is, I love it truly
Your PDA, ey, ey (I want your PDA)
Your PDA, ey, ey (I want your PDA)
(PDA, hey yeah!)
Your PDA, ey, ey (I want your PDA)
Your PDA, ey, ey, your PDA, ey, ey
(I want your PDA)

I wanna rub (I want your PDA)
All over your body (I, I, I want your PDA)
I wanna rub (I want your PDA)
All over your body (I, I, I want your PDA)
I want your PDA (that's right)
Public display of affection
I want your PDAEmbed
