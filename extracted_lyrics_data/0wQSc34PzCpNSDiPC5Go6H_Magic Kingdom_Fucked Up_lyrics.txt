1 ContributorMagic Kingdom LyricsArchaic texts feed the occult hoards
Manifest destiny calls for total war
Thule society and the runes of von list
All brought together by the fist
Light on the retreat
People feel the need for change
Illness consumes the weak
And the sick are born again
Thule society and the runes of von list
All brought together by the fist
You can't defend against magic
You can't assess the destruction
Belief system fails
Leaves behind a spiritual void
Hate fills the vacuum
And all the world is destroyedYou might also likeEmbed
