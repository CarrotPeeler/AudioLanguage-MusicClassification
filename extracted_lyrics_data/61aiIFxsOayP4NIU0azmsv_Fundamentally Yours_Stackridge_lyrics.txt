4 ContributorsFundamentally Yours LyricsFinding time to write a line to someone that I knew
I remember slipping sideways falling in to view
Oh how can it be that words can't make you see
The hat stand that hangs in the hallway
Changing sides like morning brides
To satisfy your friends
You overstate your undercoat
To start a new trend
Flying home to work alone on
Building schemes and roads
I remembered holding horses
Catching summer colds
Oh how can it be that words can't make you see
The lampshade that lights up the landing
Changing sides like morning brides
To pacify my friends
You overpay your underdogs
Perhaps you pretend
Framing maps to fill the gaps
That fall across my room
I Remembered turning tables
Reaching for the moon
You might also likeOh how can it be that words can't make you see
The witness who waits in the wardrobeEmbed
