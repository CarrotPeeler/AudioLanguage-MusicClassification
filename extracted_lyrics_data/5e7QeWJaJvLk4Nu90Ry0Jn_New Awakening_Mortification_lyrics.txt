2 ContributorsNew Awakening LyricsEradication of disobedience
The lake of fire for the dying soul
The crucifixion brings try remission eternal life the eternal goal
Christ descended and took the keys
Enthroned majestic at God's right hand
The great commission the chilren of God
You(r) eyes on Jesus you of faithful witness
CHORUS
Are you ready to learn
Rise up people in power
Are you ready to burn
With fire from on high
I won't choose pleasures of sin
For a short time
I won't betray the sacrifice
That Christ made for me
No excuse to enter the state of sin
I will not turn away
CHORUS
Satan's name exposes all he is to be
Reprobate with no authority
There is only one name by which you may be saved
You might also likeThat's the name of Jesus Christ
You must realize death is the result of sin
Seek God's forgiveness seek it down within
