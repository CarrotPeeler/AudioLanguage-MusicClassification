If I add your milk, that is manners
If I stop there, claiming ignorance of taste
That is tea
If I pour your cup, that is friendship

But if I measure the sugar to satisfy your expectant tongue
Then that is love
But if I measure the sugar to satisfy your expectant tongue
Then that is love
Sitting untouched
