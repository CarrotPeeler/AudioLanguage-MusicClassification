An Army brat
A small town girl in a big city flat
She's got a new life, down the road a few
She traded in her clothes, bought something new
Small town girl
Small town girl
So call me up
I'll be right there
Just wave your arms
Send up a flare
Small town girl
Too shy to say no
Something pulled her away
I guess you never know
Small town girl
