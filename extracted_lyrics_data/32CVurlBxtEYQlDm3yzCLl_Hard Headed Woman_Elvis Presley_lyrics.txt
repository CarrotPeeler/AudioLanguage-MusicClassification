Well, a hard-headed woman
A soft-hearted man
Been the cause of trouble
Ever since the world began

Oh yeah (Oh yeah)
Ever since the world began, uh-huh
A hard-headed woman
Been a thorn in the side of man, uh-huh

Now Adam told to Eve
"Listen here to me
Don't you let me catch you
Messing round that apple tree"

Oh yeah (Oh yeah)
Ever since the world began, uh-huh
A hard-headed woman
Been a thorn in the side of man
Oh yeah (Oh yeah)
Ever since the world began, uh-huh
A hard-headed woman
Been a thorn in the side of man
You might also like
Samson told Delilah
Loud and clear
"Keep your cotton-picking fingers
Out my curly hair"

Oh yeah (Oh yeah)
Ever since the world began, uh-huh
A hard-headed woman
Been a thorn in the side of man, uh-huh

I heard about a king
Who was doin' swell
Till he started playing
With that evil Jezebel

Oh yeah (Oh yeah)
Ever since the world began, uh-huh
A hard-headed woman
Been a thorn in the side of man
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh
Uh-huh, uh-huh
I got a woman
A head like a rock
If she ever went away
I'd cry around the clock

Oh yeah (Oh yeah)
Ever since the world began, uh-huh
A hard-headed woman
Been a thorn in the side of man, uh-huh
A hard-headed woman
Been a thorn in the side of man, uh-huhEmbed
