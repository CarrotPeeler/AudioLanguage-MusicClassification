1 ContributorYou Hurt Me LyricsSeems like I can't find no words, to tell you I want you here
Seems like I can't find no words, to tell you I want near
When our eyes meet, the love in my heart sinks deeply inside
For your love is the curidy answer to my heart
Can that be?
You know you hurt me
You knew that I was crumbled up inside
Never again I want to feel that feeling
Never again I want to hurt like that
Kind of feeling it made me close my heart
Kind of hurt that made me feel lies
And never again I want to live this feeling
Seems like I can't find no ways to tell you I want you near
You know you hurt me
You knew that I was crumbled up inside
You knew that we could never be no more, no
And now we both feel how love can be
It seems like I can't find no words to tell you I want you near
Seems like I can't find no words to tell you I want here
When our eyes meet the love in my heart sinks deeply inside
For your love is the curidy answer to my heart
Can that be?
