Put on the headset, get on the stage
Out on a midnight escapade
Didn't want to steal your thunder, wouldn't want to play your game
Makin' all the headlines, gettin' on the front page

Oh-ah, oh-ah
Didn't even know her number, I didn't even know her name

Stand up, stand up and take it
Stand up, stand up and make it
Stand up, stand up and face it
Stand up

Get on the red dress, slip on the lace
Up for a high heel and a pretty face
Woman want to get you under, woman want to get you tame
Lovin' on a hot night, stokin' up the flame

Oh-ah, oh-ah
Didn't even know her number, I didn't even know her name
You might also like
Stand up, stand up and take it
Stand up, stand up and make it
Stand up, stand up and face it
Stand up

You drink it, oh


Oh, oh
Oh

Stand up, stand up and take it
Stand up, stand up and make it
Stand up, stand up and face it
Stand up, you can make it
Stand up, stand up and take it
Stand up, stand up and make it
Stand up, stand up and face it
Stand up
