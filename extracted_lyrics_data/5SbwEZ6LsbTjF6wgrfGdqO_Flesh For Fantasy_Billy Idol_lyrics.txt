19 ContributorsFlesh for Fantasy Lyrics
Well, there's a change in pace
Of fantasy and taste
A-do you like good music?
A-do you like to dance? Oh, yeah
Hanging out for a body shot at night
Ain't it strange what they do to feel all right? Oh, yeah
So, when will you call?
I am experienced, oh, yeah

Face to face and back to back
You see and feel my sex attack, sing it

Flesh
Flesh for fantasy
We want flesh
Flesh for fantasy

It's after midnight
Oh, are you feeling all right? Oh, yeah
Turn out the light, babe
Are you someone else tonight? Ooh
Neighbour to neighbour, door to door
Don't ask questions, time for it all, oh, yeah
You might also like
Face to face and back to back
You see and feel my sex attack, sing it

Flesh
Flesh for fantasy
We cry (Huh), "Flesh
Flesh for fantasy"

Ow!
I sing for culture

Father loves his son
Mothers, daughters too
It's an old, old story
Cries the new world too

Flesh, flesh
Flesh for fantasy
We want flesh
Flesh for fantasy
We want flesh
Flesh for fantasy
You cry, "Flesh
Flesh for fantasy"
A-do you like good music?
A-do you like to dance? Ooh
It's nearly morning
You wanna risk a chance?
Neighbour to neighbour, door to door, ooh
Enjoy the crime, you do your time
Never been nothing before3Embed
