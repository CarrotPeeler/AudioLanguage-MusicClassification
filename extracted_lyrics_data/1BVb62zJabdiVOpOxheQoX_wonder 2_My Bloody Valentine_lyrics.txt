I'm moving your eyes slow for you see, see all the way
And I found you something to hold you alive
Somewhere you stand on worry too unfortunate
Will you sing on to come to use on

I'm moving your eyes slow for you see, see all the way
And I found you something to hold you alive into the head on
Remember you used to
You were always late to see tomorrow
Everyone knows that you're such too soonYou might also like1Embed
