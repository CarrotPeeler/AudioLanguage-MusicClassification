Mandy is two
You ought to see her eyes of cornflower blue
They really look as if they actually knew
That she's a big girl now

Mandy is two
You ought to see how many things she can do
She knows her alphabet and ties her own shoes
And no one showed her how

If you could see her majesty
With braids in her hair
Almost as though her Sunday beau
Came around and brought her an orchid to wear

Mommy is blue
Because her little girl is going on three
But Miss Amanda she's as proud as can be
'Cause she's a big girl now

If you could see her majesty
With braids in her hair
Almost as though her Sunday beau
Came around and brought her an orchid to wear
You might also like
Mommy is blue
Because her little girl is going on three
But Miss Amanda she's as proud as can be
'Cause she's a big girl nowEmbed
