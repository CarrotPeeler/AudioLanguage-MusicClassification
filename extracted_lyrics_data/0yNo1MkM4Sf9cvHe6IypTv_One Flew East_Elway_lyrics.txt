1 ContributorOne Flew East LyricsThe orderlies shuffle across black and white marble
They're bustling reminders that no one can slow down the days
The white coats and black boards, they conspire behind locked doors
They don't want to tell you how long until it eats me away
I wish you would wake me when I'm violently shaking
Tossing and turning through dreams where I die giving up
I wish it had been you that I'd given my heart to
Instead of just wasting these moments by biting my tongue
And I've been having dreams of black and white infirmaries
With the palest walls that always stand in silence
If I thought that you could hear, I'd whisper in your ear
All the things I couldn't come around to writing
I've been constantly stepping with these unwanted weapons
Like the things that I think and I feel will destoy everything
So I'll hold a flame to the things I won't tell you
And sift through the ashes for some kind of reason to sing
And I'll bleed right out of these wounds that I gave myself
And I'll live out, live out this life with no body's helpYou might also likeEmbed
