1 ContributorOutlaw LyricsA broken man before you
My spirit flown away
Can't stop the hammer falling, calling
See only shades of grey
Black is the night approaching
No way I can stay
Inside the storm is growing
A new world born today, yeah, yeah
Screams are never heard
No stone's left unturned
My past is slowly dying
Can't blame a man for trying
Holding on against the grain
Caught in the eye of a hurricane
I'm the outlaw outside looking in
Visions of what could have been
Oh, I'm hunted night and day
Seems crime's the only way
One day becoming the prey
Fighting the demons within me
My heart's melting away
Justice for all who damn me
We'll meet again one day, oh...
Pointing fingers accuse me
This animal should run free
Escaping chains that bind me
Breaking free

Ooh, I'm caught in the eye of a hurricane
I'm the outlaw outside looking in
Visions of what could have been
Oh, I'm hunted night and day
Seems crime's the only way
One day becoming the prey
Alright, outta sight!
Here it is
I'm the outlaw outside looking in
Visions of what could have been
Oh, I'm hunted night and day
Seems crime's the only way
One day becoming the prey, oh...
The outlaw, outlaw
You never get me
Never catch me again
Yeah, I'm gonna run, run, run
Run, run, run, run away
Outlaw, outlaw
Yeah, never catch me again
Outlaw...Embed
