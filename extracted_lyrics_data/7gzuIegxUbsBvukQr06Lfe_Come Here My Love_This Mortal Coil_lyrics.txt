4 ContributorsCome Here My Love LyricsCome here my love
This feeling has me spellbound
It's the story line in paragraphs laid down the same
In fathoms of my inner mind I'm mistified by this mood
This melancholy feeling just don't do no good
Come here my love
And I will lift my spirits high for you
I'd like to fly away and spend a day or two
Just contemplate the fields and leaves talking about nothing
Just laying down in shades of effervescent
The effervescent colors and shades of time and tide
I'm falling through
Become enraptured by the sights and sounds in intrigue of nature and beauty
Come along with me and take it all with you
Come here my loveYou might also likeEmbed
