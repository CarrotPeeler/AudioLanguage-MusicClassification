5 ContributorsA Goodnightâ€™s Sleep LyricsA better slumber
Was in your arms
Spent tangled up in you
A sudden morning
Crashed in the room
With an uninvited sudden change in you
What can I say
Where's that girl from last night
Who's stuck outside
And looks just like you too
You can sleep in your own bed tonight
Sleep away as summer came screaming out my name
You can sleep in your own bed tonight
I hope for your sake that you don't wake up as broken as I am
For the lack of better
Words to say
All I said was goodnight
Once again, in self defense
I won't sleep a wink
To prevent dreaming of you
You can sleep in your own bed tonight
Sleep away as summer came screaming out my name
You can sleep in your own bed tonight
I hope for your sake that you don't wake up as broken as I am
Sleep in your own bed tonight
I that some day you will wake up as lonely as I am
You might also likeYou can sleep in your own bed tonight
Sleep away as summer came screaming out my name
You can sleep in your own bed tonight
I hope for your sake that you don't wake up as broken as I am
Sleep in your own bed tonight
I that some day you will wake up as lonely as I am
'Cause it works both ways
'Cause it works both ways
'Cause it works both ways
Sleep in your own bedEmbed
