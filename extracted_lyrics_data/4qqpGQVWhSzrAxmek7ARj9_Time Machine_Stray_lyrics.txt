1 ContributorTime Machine LyricsThe time has come at last
Let's go explore the past
We'll build a time machine
To see the bygone dreams
We dreamed but never thought
The time would ever come
When we would see the past
Just as it was done
Let me turn your mind around
Let me take you to the past that you should know
It's lovelier than a rose in bloom
And, oh can you imagine?
There, see Custer fall
He really gavе his all
And there, see ancient Romе
It's burning to the ground
Let me turn your mind around
Let me take you to the past that you should know
In front of you, illusions go
And, oh can you imagine?
You never thought that you
Could see things quite so true
Like games we used to play
Back in your nursery daysYou might also likeEmbed
