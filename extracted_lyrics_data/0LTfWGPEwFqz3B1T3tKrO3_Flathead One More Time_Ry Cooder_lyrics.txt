1 ContributorFlathead One More Time Lyrics
Three o'clock this morning I woke up in a dream
Thought I heard a flat-head motor roar, I thought I smelled gasoline
A feeling came upon me that I ain't had in years
Something like a hot dry wind whistling past my ears
Saying time, time, time, time is all you've got
There's a memory that's still burning way down in my mind
And that's why I'm going out and try a flathead one more time

I ain't seen my racing buddies in thirty years or more
One by one I lost them out on the dry lake floor
We liked to push those flat head cars as hard as they could go
Just like old Whisky Bob down on Thunder Road
I hear their voices calling just across the finish line
And that's why I'm going out and try a flathead one more time

I'll get back to you baby, don't you have no fear
'Cause I been there and I wrecked that and baby I'm still here
But I can't take you with me when I cross the finish line
And that's why I'm going out and try a flathead one more time

Time, time, time is all you've gotYou might also likeEmbed
