1 ContributorStubborn Kind of Fellow Lyrics
Say yeah, yeah, yeah; say yeah, yeah, yeah
One more time
Say yeah, yeah, yeah; say yeah, yeah, yeah

Well, I try to put my arms around you
All because I wanna hold you tight
But every time I reach for you, baby
And try to kiss you, you're just jumping out of sight

Whoa, I've got news for you
Baby, that I've made plans for two

I guess I'm just a stubborn kind of fellow
Got my mind made up about you

Whoa, whoa
Say yeah, yeah, yeah; say yeah, yeah, yeah
Talking to you, baby
Say yeah, yeah, yeah; say yeah, yeah, yeah

I'm gonna lovе you
(Gonna love you in every way)
In еvery way
(Gonna love you in every way)
I'm gonna love you, love you, love you
In every way
You might also like
When other guys have haunted
And waited just a moment (Ooh)
I'll be by your side
Now I know you've heard about me
Bad things about me
But, please, won't you let me confide

Whoa, I have kissed a few
But baby, I have been abused

I guess I'm just a stubborn kind of fellow
Got my mind made up about you

Whoa, whoa
Say yeah, yeah, yeah; say yeah, yeah, yeah
Listen to me, honey
Say yeah, yeah, yeah; say yeah, yeah, yeah
Hoo


Whoa, I've got news for you
Baby, that I've made plans for two
I guess I'm just a stubborn kind of fellow
Got my mind made up about you

Well, let me hear you say
Say yeah, yeah, yeah; say yeah, yeah, yeah
Listen to me, honey
Say yeah, yeah, yeah; say yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, you look so good to me tonight
Say yeah, yeah, yeah; say yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Whoa, whoa
Say yeah, yeah, yeah; yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, oh, ohEmbed
