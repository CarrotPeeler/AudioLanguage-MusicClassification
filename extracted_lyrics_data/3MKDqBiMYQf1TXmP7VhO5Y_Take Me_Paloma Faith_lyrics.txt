10 ContributorsTake Me Lyrics
One, two, three four!
Hmm, hey, baby, come on

24 hours till I take flight
Baby, let's pretend tonight
Only just a matter of time before I'm
Gonna wish I was by your side

It's gonna be a long day
A long night
I want you to do me right

Come on, take me
Take me
Only you can stimulate me
Won't you take me?
Take me
I just wanna scream, so make me
Tonight

Ten thousand people
In the state of fever
I'm blinded by the flashing lights
Turn my back on the stage
I'm gonna make an escape
While the driver waits outside
You might also like
It's gonna be a long day
I need a long night
I want you to do me right

Oh, baby, take me
Take me
Only you can stimulate me
Won't you take me?
Take me
I just wanna scream, so make me
Tonight
Oh, baby

Eight hours in and I'm still undressed
Don't move too fast I'm not finished yet
When I'm with you I wanna lose myself
Forget the shoe and do something else
7 am and the sun is up
I need somebody just to fill my cup
9 am I'm off to JFK
Kiss me now, take my breath away

Oh, take me
Take me
Only you can stimulate me
Won't you take me
Take me
I just wanna scream so make me
Turn it up, turn it out
Collecting my frequent flyer points for you, baby
Turn me on, turn me off
Ha, back on a plane again, what?
Turn it up, turn it out
Only you, only you
Turn me on, turn me off
Woah, woah
Turn it up, turn it out
Oh, you make me scream and shout
Turn me on, turn me off (Make me scream)
Turn it up, turn it out
Baby, baby yeah
Turn me on, turn me off
Oh baby

Eight hours in and I'm still undressed
Don't move too fast I'm not finished yet
When I'm with you off anna lose myself
Forget the shoe and do something else
7 am and the sun is up
I need somebody just to fill my cup
9 am I'm out to JFK
Hit me now take my breath away
Oh, take, me
Take me
Only you can stimulate me
Won't you take me?
Take me
I just wanna scream so make me, ooo
Oh, oooh, tonight, yeah tonightEmbed
