Gonna wake this time to further on the plan
And with an early start the world is in your hands
But as the clock strikes noon
Still right there where I stand
But you know
The day's not nearly done
And you're not the only one
With desire to see it through
So let's say
If not today
CHORUS: Tomorrow, tomorrow
Tomorrow, tomorrow
Tomorrow, tomorrow
We can see it through, if not today
Tomorrow, tomorrow
Tomorrow, tomorrow
Tomorrow, tomorrow
We can try again, if not today
As the sun starts setting, leaving us again
Gonna take this time to further on the plan
And with an early start the world is in your hands
But as the clock strikes twelve
Still right there where I stand
But you know
The day's not nearly done
And you're not the only one
With desire to see it through
So let's say
If not today
