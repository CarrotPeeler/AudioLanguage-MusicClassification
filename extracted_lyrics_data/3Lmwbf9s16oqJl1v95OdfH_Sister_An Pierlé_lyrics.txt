To say wise things
To tell true things
When you laugh
I haven't got the strength
To tell you straight things
'cause they are different
For everyone
Message blows at the sun
Grace
I've got a pretty face
Which automatically implies I'm dumb
Wise Japanese master says
No time for Roo Di Ments
He's in my head
And I just can't get him out
All is said
And done
Sister is calling
In my head where she sleeps
Longin' for desire
She's afraid
It's never to keep
Sister is moving me
You might also likeI haven't got the guts
To preach you blue things
To talk about true things
I don't know
'cause I'm a chicken in the worst
Sense of the word
'bout these harsh things
Wanna be a friend to everyone
Message blows at the sun
I haven't got the sense
To say sound things
Nor profound things
I'm not strong
'cause I am far too afraid to
Be taken wrongly
Though I really say
Nothing at all
All is said
I'm doneEmbed
