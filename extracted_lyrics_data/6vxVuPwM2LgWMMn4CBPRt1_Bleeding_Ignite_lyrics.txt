To my country
The mounting costs
My freedom's lost
Death of liberty
Live in a Kingdom of reigns
The dogs of war rule the day
The hypocrites roam in gangs

Speak the truth
Got something to say
Lead the boys off to war
Is just to throw them away
Depleted rounds kill
RU-238

Bringing on our darkest days
This is the death of liberty
This is the price that life has come to mean
All our friends, now enemies
The misery of

Wounded troops left to rot
No help from the VA

Bringing on our darkest days
