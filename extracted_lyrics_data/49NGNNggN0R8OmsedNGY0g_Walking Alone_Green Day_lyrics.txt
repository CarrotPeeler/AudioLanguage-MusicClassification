17 ContributorsWalking Alone Lyrics
Come together like a foot in a shoe
Only this time, I think I've stuck my foot in my mouth
Thinkin' out loud and actin' in vain
Knockin' over anyone that stands in my way

Sometimes, I need to apologize
Sometimes, I need to admit that I ain't right
Sometimes, I should just keep my mouth shut
Or only say hello
Sometimes, I still feel I'm walkin' alone

Walk on eggshells on my old stompin' ground
Yet there's really no one left that's hangin' around
Isn't that another familiar face?
Too drunk to figure out they're fadin' away

Sometimes, I need to apologize
Sometimes, I need to admit that I ain't right
Sometimes, I should just keep my mouth shut
Or only say hello
Sometimes, I still feel I'm walkin' alone

Sometimes, I need to apologize
Sometimes, I need to admit that I ain't right
Sometimes, I should just keep my mouth shut
Or only say hello
Sometimes, I still feel I'm walkin' alone3Embed
