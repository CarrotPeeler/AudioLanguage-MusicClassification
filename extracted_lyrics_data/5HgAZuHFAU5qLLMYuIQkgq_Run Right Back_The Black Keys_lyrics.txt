11 ContributorsRun Right Back Lyrics
Before she hits the ground
She's gonna want to explode
Never step aside
Never run and hide
She holds it all up under
That pretty head of hers, oh
It comes screaming out
In a little electric shout

She's the worst thing
I've been addicted to
Oh no, oh no, oh no
I'll run right back
Run right back to her
I won't jump the track
I'll run right back, I'm sure
I run right back to her
I run right back to her
I run right back to her
I run right back to her
I run right back to her

Well, she's a special thing
She doesn't read too much, oh
But there's no doubt
She's written about
Finest exterior
She's so superior, oh
But she won't allow
And I'm wounded now

She's the worst thing
I've been addicted to
Oh no, oh no, oh no
I'll run right back
Run right back to her
I won't jump the track
I'll run right back, I'm sure
I run right back to her
I run right back to her
I run right back to her
I run right back to her
I run right back to her

Oh-oh yeah
Oh-oh yeah, yeah
Oh-oh yeah
Oh-oh yeah, yeahEmbed
