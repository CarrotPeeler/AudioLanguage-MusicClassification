2 ContributorsSilver Lining LyricsPRILLY T: Fuck off!
MAN: Hey, what happened?
MAN: Hello, hello, hello, hello!
PRILLY T: Yo! Fucking weirdo…
BARBARA: Prilly?
PRILLY T: Hey, Barbara
BARBARA: Wait, what are… Is it raining outside?
PRILLY T: Yea, it’s raining outside. That’s why I’m soaked
BARBARA: Are you crying?
PRILLY T: No... I’m not crying
BARBARA: Well, why is your face wet?
PRILLY T: I just told you! It’s raining…
BARBARA: Well, how did you get here?
PRILLY T: I walked here
BARBARA: Well, why didn’t you take a cab?
PRILLY T: I just wasn’t feeling a cab
Didn’t want the whole human exchange... thing
BARBARA: Prilly, you know you don’t have an appoint until spring-
PRILLY T: I know I don’t have an appointment until the spring
There’s just a lot of shit that I need to speak
So can you listen?
BARBARA: Uhh… I’m kind of swamped
PRILLY T: I insist. Can you do your job?
For like once?
BARBARA: Okay…
PRILLY T: Thank you
I finally got a response back from Rudiff
BARBARA: Oh?
PRILLY T: He pretty much told me to go get lost
BARBARA: I’m sorry, how do you feel?
You might also likePRILLY T: It’s like a fire inside of me
Has suddenly turned to an ash
I’m trying to look on the brighter side of things
But all I feel is alone
How can a person that you idolized
Not be the person that you thought?
There’s so many twists and little turny roads
And I guess I just don’t know where to cross
But I’ve seen the other side
And it’s got me feeling down
I figured, why should I end my life
When another me’s crawling about?
I don’t get it, and that’s too bad
I’m all thumbs now—not going back
What I’m feeling is not okay
O’ I’m suffering, and you’re to blame!
BARBARA: Okay, you need to calm down
You’re being violent
PRILLY T: I’m not being violent! I’m just… excited I guess
‘Lotta feelings. ‘Lotta prickly little feelings
BARBARA: Okay, can you describe me these feelings?
PRILLY T: It’s kinda’ like… like being inside an enormous wasp nest
And they’re all like… really, really upset that I’m there
BARBARA: Well, have you been taking your medication?
PRILLY T:I stopped taking my medication
BARBARA: When?
PRILLY T: I don’t know, like two weeks ago…
BARBARA: Prilly, you can’t be off your medication
PRILLY T: I know, but it makes me feel all fucked up
And I’m already all fucked up
So it just kinda’ like… double-fucks me
BARBARA: Prilly-
PRILLY T: Barbara, I don’t wanna’ be double-fucked
O’ this foundation inside of me
Just got the most miniscule crack!
And all the tarry, gooey shit that surrounds
Is starting to ooze on in
It’s funny how this all worked out
I’m stunned I couldn’t see
All of its buried right under the ground that I stand on
And I never thought to dig…
Bitch, what is in that box on the table?
BARBARA: It’s nothing. Tell me more about this ground-
PRILLY T: Woah, woah, hold on, hold on
Lemme’ see that
BARBARA: I don’t think that’s a good idea-
PRILLY T: Bitch, lemme’ see it!
BARBARA: Prilly, I…
PRILLY T: These are my letters...
BARBAR: I can… I can-
PRILLY T: These are my letters to Rudiff…
BARBARA: There’s- There’s a perfectly logical-
PRILLY T: How did you get these...?
I don’t get it, and that’s too bad
I’m all thumbs now—not going back
What I’m feeling is not okay
O’ I’m suffering, and you’re to blame!
Okay, you got… You got ten seconds to explain yourself
BARBARA: Why don’t we just-
PRILLY T: No, don’t- Don’t look at the door
Don’t look at the door
The door doesn’t have the answers, bitch!
Look at me. Look at me!
BARBARA: Prilly, wh-
PRILLY T: Why do you have these?
BARBARA: I...
PRILLY T: Why the fuck do you have these?!?
BARBARA: I-
PRILLY T: Is he your patient too?
BARBARA: No-
PRILLY T: Answer me, you fucking whore!
Why the fuck do you have my-
Oh, you’re gonna’ cry?
You’re gonna cry?
Ahuuhuuhuu
Aaaahuhuhu, I’m crying too, bitch!

BARBARA: It was Rudiff!!
PRILLY T: Wh- Th-this was his idea-
What are you two together?
You’re lying
You’re lying!
You’re- you’re a fucking liar!
Aaaahhh!
O’ don’t even try it, you’re dead bitch!
C’mere! What is that? Oh, a pencil sharpener!
A brand new pencil sharpener!
You know, lemme’ borrow it so I can use it to fuck you up!
Yea, you like that?
Aww, look at this!
Look at this, you got some brand new holes!
Some brand new holes to join the other ones!
Who’s in whose head now, bitch?!?
No, don’t- don’t- No, no, no!
Don’t die yet, don’t die yet!
I mean look around, we’ve got this great office
With sooo many wonderful toys!
Oh, lemme’ just grab this stapler
So I can staple your fucking eyelids shut!
Read my tells now, I dare you!
And you’re next, Rudiff!Embed
