Where'er you go, you know I'll be there
If you go far, you know I’ll be there
Oh, I'll go anywhere
So, I'll see you there
You place the name, you know I'll be there
You name the time, you know I'll be there
I'll go anywhere
So, I'll see you there

I don’t care, if you don't mind
I'll be there, not far behind
I will dare, keep in mind
I’ll be there for you

When there's the truth, you know I'll be there
Amongst the lies, you know I'll be there
I'll go anywhere
So I'll see you there

I don't care, if you don't mind
I'll be there, not far behind
I will dare, keep in mind
I'll be there for you, alright!

If you should fall, you know I'll be there
To catch a call, you know I'll be there
I'll go anywhere
So, I'll see you there

I don't care, if you don't mind
I'll be there, not far behind
I will dare, keep in mind
I don't care

I'll be there for you
I'll be there for you
I'll be there for you4Embed
