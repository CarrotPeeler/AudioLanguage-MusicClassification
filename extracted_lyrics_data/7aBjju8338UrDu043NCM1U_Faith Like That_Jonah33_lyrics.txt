1 ContributorFaith Like That LyricsI have heard about the days of old
About the men who followed You
And how they saw the Supernatural
And became the chosen few
So I come before You now
Tearing off my earthly crowns
For this one thing I have Found
I want a faith like that
To see the dead rise
Or to see You pass by
Oh I, I want a faith like that
Whatever the cost
I'll suffer the loss, Oh I
I want faith like that
I'm not looking for a miracle
Signs and wonders are things thereof
I caught a glimpse of what You want from me
And what I have is not enough
I read the story one more time
Of those who gave to You their lives
With no fear or compromise
You might also likeI want a faith like that
To see the dead rise
Or to see You pass by
Oh I, I want a faith like that
Whatever the cost
I'll suffer the loss, Oh I
I want the faith that can move any mountain
And send them to the sea
I want the faith that can break every stronghold
That keeps you, keeps you from me
I want a faith like that
To see the dead rise
Or to see You pass by
Oh I, I want a faith like that
I want a faith like that
To see the dead rise
Or to see You pass by
Oh I, I want a faith like that
Whatever the cost
I'll suffer the loss, Oh I
I want a faith like that, a faith like thatEmbed
