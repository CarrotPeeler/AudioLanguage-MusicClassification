3 ContributorsThe Last Thing on My Mind Lyrics
It's a lesson too late for the learning, yeah
Made of sand, oh it's made of sand
In the wink of an eye my soul keeps on turning, yeah
In your hand, in your hand

Are you going away with no word of farewell?
Will there be not a trace for me to find?
Well, I could have loved you better
I didn't mean to be unkind
Oh, you must know that was the last thing on my mind

As we walk all my thoughts they are a-tumbling down, down
Round and around, round and round
And underneath I hear the subways tumbling
Underground, underground

Are you going away with no word of farewell?
Will there be not a trace left behind?
Well, I could have loved you better
I didn't mean to be unkind
You know that was the last thing on my mind
You might also like

You got reasons of plenty for going
This I know, this I know
For the weeds have been steadily growing
Please don't go, please don't go

Are you going away with no word of farewell?
Will there be not a trace left to find?
Well, I could have loved you better
I didn't mean to be unkind
You know that was the last thing on my mind
