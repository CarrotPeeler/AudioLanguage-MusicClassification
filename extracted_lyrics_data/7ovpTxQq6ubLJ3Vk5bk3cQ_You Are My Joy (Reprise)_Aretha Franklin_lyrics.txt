3 ContributorsYou Are My Joy (Reprise) LyricsThis is love, my darling
Can't you feel it?
When you really had me, concealing
I just can't be that way with you
The light of my life
And you don't even even  know it
How many ways can I show it?
Wherever you are, I wanna be with you, baby
The joining of our hearts
The joining of our hands
With this ring, I thee wed
The love of my life
I'll trust you with my heart, dear
Trust you more when you're not here
This is your last chance
There'll be no backward glance
Are we on or are we through?
This is your last chance
There'll be no backward glance
Are we on or are we through?
You feel it in your heart
Feel it down in your soul, baby
Oh yeah yeah...You might also likeEmbed
