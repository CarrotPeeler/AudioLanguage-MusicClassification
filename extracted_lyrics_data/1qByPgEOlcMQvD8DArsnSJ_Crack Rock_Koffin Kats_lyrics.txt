1 ContributorCrack Rock LyricsTime to make a fucking deal
I wanna get the shit that's real
I gotta ride a scoring high
That blows my god forsaken mind
Crack rock
Rythm and blow!
Pick me ups and throw me downers
I wanna reach the highest power
I gotta find the inner strength
That takes me to that darker placeYou might also likeEmbed
