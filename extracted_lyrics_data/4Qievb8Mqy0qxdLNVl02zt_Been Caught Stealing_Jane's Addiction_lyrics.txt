28 ContributorsBeen Caught Stealing Lyrics
I've been caught stealin', once when I was 5
I enjoy stealin', it's just as simple as that
Oh well, it's just a simple fact
When I want something, man, I don't wanna pay for it

Now I walk right through the door
And I walked right through the door
Hey, alright, if I get by
It's mine, mine, all mine
Hey!

Yeah, my girl, she's one too, she'll go and get her a skirt
Stick it under her shirt, she grabbed a razor for me
And she did it just like that
When she wants something, man, she don't wanna pay for it

She'll walk right through the door
Walk right through the door
Hey, alright, if I get by
It's mine, mine, all mine
Let's go!

La-la-la-la-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah
Dah-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah, ah yeah!

Sat around the pile, sat and laughed
Sat and laughed and waved 'em into the air
And we did it just like that
When we want something, man, we don't wanna pay for it

We walk right through the door
Walk right through the door
Hey, alright, if I get by
It's uh, mine, mine, uh, mine uh, mine uh
Mine, mine, mine, uh, mine, all mine
It's all mine7Embed
