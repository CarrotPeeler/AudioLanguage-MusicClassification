5 ContributorsWe Might Fall Apart Lyrics
There's something strange about the way
The tap water tastes
Making speeches for the walls
Gets harder with every phrase

I woke up and everyone had gone
I woke up when the sun was setting
I woke up and you were gone away

At any given day
We might fall apart, we might fall apart
At any minute now
We might fall apart, just like a house of cards

There's something strange about the way
The horizon glows
We'll lie down on the road and the cars drive
Inches from our toes

I woke up and everyone had gone
I woke up when the sun was setting
I woke up and you were gone away
You might also like
At any given day
We might fall apart, we might fall apart
At any minute now
We might fall apart, just like a house of cards

Maybe it's the chloroform kicking in
The chloroform is kicking in
Or maybe we've given in
Maybe it's the chloroform kicking in
The chloroform is kicking in
Or maybe we've given in

At any given day
We might fall apart, we might fall apart
At any minute now
We might fall apart, just like a house of cards

Just like a house of cards
Just like a house of cards
Just like a house of cardsEmbed
