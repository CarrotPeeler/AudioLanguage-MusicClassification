3 ContributorsRocket Ride LyricsI sought salvation but I found insanity
Lost in a mess I returned to profanity
I've been reaching for the sky
But I got stuck with my feet down in concrete
Don't you run away now
Don't you be afraid
You know there is a meaning, woah
Don't you run away now
Don't you live a lie
There's more to life than struggle
Take a rocket ride
Suffered my way with divine aspiration
I failed to resist the sweetest temptation
Been stuck to religion till I've clung to the pie
You never really miss it until you really try
Tried to jump but held down by concrete
The venery surrounding my feet, yeah
Don't you run away now
Don't you be afraid
You know there is a meaning,woah
Don't you run away now
Don't you live a lie
There's more to life than struggle
Take a rocket ride
You might also likeOh, I've tried to reach higher
On and on but my flesh is too weak
Been searching for answers
I've been led to the fire
There must be a reason
For us to be down here
Oh, I'm drifting
Yeah, temptation
Carried out to sea
I'm drifting
I'm drifting away
I'm drifting away
I'm drifting away
I've been reaching for the sky
But I got stuck with my feet down in concrete
Don't you run away now
Don't you be afraid
You know there is a meaning, woah
Don't you run away now
Don't you live a lie
There's more to life than struggle
Take a rocket ride
(I'm a piledriver)
Don't you run away now
Don't you be afraid
You know there is a meaning, woah
(I'm a piledriver)
Don't you run away now
Don't you live a lie
There's more to life than struggle
Take a rocket rideEmbed
