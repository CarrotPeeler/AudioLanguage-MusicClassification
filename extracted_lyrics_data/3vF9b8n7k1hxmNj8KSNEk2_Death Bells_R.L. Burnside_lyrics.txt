Death bell ringing all in my head
Sound like to me I can hear this moaning people
Death bell ringing all in my head
Yeah I know that I was gonna leave on a chariot
Wonder what kind gonna take me away from here
Yeah my mama told me
My father told me too
Said one morning son that chariot coming for you
And I been wonderin' what kinda chariot, oh Lord gonna take me away from here
Yeah you know the life I been livin' people
Oh Lord for a good many year
Tell me the Lord will forgive like me
For most any ol' thing he do
Tell me the Lord will forgive like me
For most any ol' thing he do
Yeah, you know and I'm one of those kinds of people
I believe he will forgive me tooYou might also likeEmbed
