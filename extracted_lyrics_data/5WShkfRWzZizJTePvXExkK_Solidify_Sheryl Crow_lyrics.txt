3 ContributorsSolidify Lyrics
Three, four

Pouring in and around the great wellspring of simple feeling
And I need bearings in the face of your cool, cool fire
Walking backwards with the pounding of your voice
Makes my soul tired
And concrete is as concrete doesn't
And voices can drown

Why should I
Why should I
Why should I
Why should I
Solidify?
Make me real
So you can see me

I guess you thought
I'd hide the sun from my liquid thoughts
And make ice for you
You thought I'd seed my clouds
With the rain of your personal dreams
I guess you thought I'd throw confetti
At your parade of lofty thoughts
I guess you thought I'd shine
Good morning in some good morning Jack
Surprise
You might also like
Why should I (Why should I)
Why should I (Why should I)
Why should I (Why should I)
Why should I (Why should I)
Solidify?
Make me real
So you can see me

Pouring in and around the great wellspring of simple feeling
And I need bearings in the face of your cool, cool fire
Walking backwards with the pounding of your voice
(Pounding of your voice)
Makes my soul tired
And concrete is as concrete doesn't
And voices can drown

Why should I (Why should I)
Why should I (Why should I)
Why should I (Why should I)
Why should I (Why should I)
Solidify?
Make me real
So you can see me
See me
See me so clearly
Why should I?
I need bearings in the face of your cool, cool fire
Why should I
Why should I
Solidify?
