His ultimate objective would be to get to whatever was at the top of the pagoda

Oppose the enemy squadron, pagoda heavily guarded
Opponents better flee my foes are dearly departed
Behold there's plenty of carnage, I'm Plumb loco
You're pummeled in dojo, when rumbling toe to toe
Hurt with fatal blows you jerk I'm worth my weight
In gold you may get rode in a hearseI urge you take
It slow apply pressure stepped inside sector, with wretched
Violent temper, slice and sever left right and center
Threaten and startle, you wept in sorrow I'm getting
In quarrels with veterans, that rest on their laurels
It's too late to try to make amends in cruelest place
It's time to face your end I mutilate obliged to
Take revenge, herbs act tough knowing they wasn't rugged
You're smacked up want to make something of it
Mad traps scattered, I been a rough rebel
Last man standing, when the dust settles
I'm a tidal wave with a storm you got seasick
Spies will gaze and will swarm, I'm top secret
You're skating on thin ice you'll bite the bullet slug
I'll cave in your his ultimate objective would be to get to whatever was at the top of the pagodakill pipe it's time pull the plug

I'll discard the gat from your holster, holler back at the soldier
I'm the god of havoc, enter the holographic pagoda
You target practice I'll smoke you, overwhelm and offend you
My world is suspenseful, step into the realm of potential
I'll discard the gat from your holster, holler back at the soldier
I'm the god of havoc, enter the holographic pagoda
You target practice I'll smoke you, overwhelm and offend you
My world is suspenseful, step into the realm of potential
You might also like
Prepare to get in your battle stance; the timid won't have a chance
It's perilous you're near the cliff of an avalanche
I've broken the shackles I go on the prowl
With the soldier's apparel throw in the towel
Lone Ninja pose threat won't give ya no rest
Grotesque, foes in a cold sweat
Not concerned about the hearsay I toss them down
The staircase, cause turn about is fair play
Don't compete with sergeant I'm nobly regarded
Hold the heat and cartridge foes will heave and vomit
Approach me with homage or I'll fix your wagon
Diss the captain and get hit with the fist of Samson
Vicious and I'm violent, I'm rank and gully par
You lived to tell about it, so thank your lucky stars
Shuttle with jetpack, I come were you rest at
Suckers should step back or suffer a set back
Rattled sabers, encroached were you slept
Graphic nature, I'll choke you to death
Kill the noise, clap, bang can't avoid shots rang
At point blank range, your boys got slain

I'll discard the gat from your holster, holler back at the soldier
I'm the god of havoc, enter the holographic pagoda
You target practice I'll smoke you, overwhelm and offend you
My world is suspenseful, step into the realm of potential
I'll discard the gat from your holster, holler back at the soldier
I'm the god of havoc, enter the holographic pagoda
You target practice I'll smoke you, overwhelm and offend you
My world is suspenseful, step into the realm of potentialEmbed
