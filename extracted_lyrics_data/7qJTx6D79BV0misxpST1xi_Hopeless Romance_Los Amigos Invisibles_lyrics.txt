2 ContributorsHopeless Romance LyricsIf all I had was nothing, but to be in love worth while
Your magic got me hunting, I think of you all the while
You think you see something, your thinking make me feel so high
What did you have in common, why did you ask me come and why?
And it might not be so, but my heart won't let go
So I do need to know, if there is a chance for this hopeless romance
I think of nothing, I think of everything you say
Lost gone to pressure, obsession every game I played
I know you felt it, so don't tell me it's okay
I feel neglected, and I don't want to play these games
And it might not be so, but my heart won't let go
So I do need to know, if there is a chance for this hopeless romance
Hold, your pain worth my heart
I can't wait any longer
It's your love that makes me feel
It's your love that makes me feel so high
So high, so high
And it might not be so, but my heart won't let go
So I do need to know, if there is a chance for this hopeless romance
And it might not be so, but my heart won't let go
So I do need to know, if there is a chanceSee Los Amigos Invisibles LiveGet tickets as low as $56You might also likeEmbed
