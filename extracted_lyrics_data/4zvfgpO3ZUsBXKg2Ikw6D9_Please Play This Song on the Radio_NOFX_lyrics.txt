We wrote this song
It's not too short, it's not too long
It's got back-up vocals in just the right places
It's got a few "oozin'-ahs,"
And it takes a little pause
Just before I sing the F-word
Please play this song on the radio

Almost every line is sung in time
And almost every verse ends in a rim
Only problem we had was writing enough words
(Ooh, ah)
But that's okay, because the chorus is coming up again now

Please play this song on the radio
Please play this song on the radio


(Please play this song on the radio)
(Please play this song on the radio)
Please play this song on the radio
Please play this song on the radio
Please play this song on the radio (Please play this song)
Please play this song on the radio (Please play this song)

Right about this time
Some shithead will be drawing a fat fucking line
Over the title on the back sleeve
What an asshole!
So Mr. DJ, I hope you already made your segue
Or the FCC is gonna take a shit right on your head

You can't play this song on the radio (Can't play this song)
