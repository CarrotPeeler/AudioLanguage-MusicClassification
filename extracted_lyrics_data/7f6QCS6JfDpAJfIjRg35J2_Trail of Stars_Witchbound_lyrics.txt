1 ContributorTrail of Stars LyricsSo many days I travelled through the wildness
So many miles I walked from east to west
To search the truth and overcome this blindness
And lay my weary head to rest
I climbed the mountains and crossed the deepest rivers
Through darkest forest I wandered all alone
On the trails of stars, surrender to your heart
As I follow the signs my feet are burning
For our saint leads the way, we'll never go astray
And the wheel of fortune keeps on turning
I have no fear of robbery and hunger
A guardian angel is walking by my side
With every day my faith is getting stronger
It gives me strength in deepest night
The wolves are howling, the storm is coming closer
The rain is pouring, but I still stand upright
On the trail of stars, surrender to your heart...
I climbed the mountains and crossed the deepest rivers
Through darkest forest I wandered all alone
With every step, I vanish in the distance
And now I wonder, will I ever come back home, come back home?
You might also likeOn the trail of stars, surrender to your heart...
On the trails of stars, surrender to your heart
As I follow the signs my feet are burning
For our saint leads the way, we'll never go astray
And the wheel of fortune keeps on turning...Embed
