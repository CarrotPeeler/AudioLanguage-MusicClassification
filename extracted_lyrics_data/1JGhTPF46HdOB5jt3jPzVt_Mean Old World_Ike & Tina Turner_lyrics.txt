2 ContributorsMean Old World Lyrics>
This is a mean old world
To try to live in by yourself
This is a mean old world
To have to try to live in by yourself
When you just can't get the one you love
You just have to try to use someone else
I’ve got the blues
Gonna black my bags and go
I’ve got the blues
I’m gonna black my rags and go
‘Cause I guess you don’t really love me
‘Cause you in love with Miss So-And-So
Sometimes I wonder
Why your love should be so cold
Sometimes I wonder why
Why your love should have to be so cold
Seem likе to me you don’t want me
I’m just and unlucky so-and-so
