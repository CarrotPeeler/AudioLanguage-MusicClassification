2 ContributorsSame Old Situation Lyrics
If I could just
Only ask of one more thing I'd want from you
Well it would go like this
Would you open up
And accept me for the way I am to you
Get a clue
And if you tell me
Boy I love you but you gotta change your ways
Well I would say any day
By the looks of it
We have crashed and burned
There ain't no sign of repair
Tell me this isn't fair

And still I wonder why
We always fuss and fight
And each and every night
You know I come home to you
We're at the same old situation
We're at the same old loss for words
We're at the same old situation
Here it goes once again
We're at the same old situation
We're at the same old loss for words
We're at the same old situation
Here it goes

And if it could be
Girl I just want to walk with you hand in hand
Back when I was your man
And if you hold me
Hold me like the world was promising an end
And tell me this ain't pretend
And you lift me up
And you shot me down you took me out the sky
And now I'm wondering why
Yeah, I'm struggling on
And you got me singing like a sing-a-long
Tell me I'm out of sight (and out of mind)


And I know
And you know
We may be broken
But this is not the end
And we both know that it's all a show
Nowhere left to go

We're at the same old situation
We're at the same old loss for words
We're at the same old situation
Here it goes once again
I don't want any more of this same old situation1Embed
