1 ContributorBig Train LyricsOn another destination
I hear the grinding of the wheel
Keep me waitin' at the station
And I want you to reveal
I got a steely eyed devotion
I am ready for the thrill
Feel like I'm movin' in slow motion
As my car begins to spill
Out on the track, shadow me
Down in the fools gallery
And you sow the seed
Its all that you need
You're building on Speed
Big Train
As the Passenger did mention
Darkness falls just like a thief
Now you've got my full attention
As the steam spills from beneath
Won't you let me be a Volunteer
Won't you let come within
I will be your manic engineer
I'll be your Assassin
You might also likeOut on the track, shadow me
Down in the fools gallery
And you sow the seed
Its all that you need
You're building on speed
Big train
Won't you whisper to my face
What you see can't be replaced
By the fountain we embrace
On the mountain in my Grace
Out on the track, shadow me
Down in the fools gallery
And you sow the seed
Its all that you need
You're building on speed
Big train
Big train
