Won't you admit
There were injustices
Along the way
That's got to hurt
However poignantly
Don't let them laugh at me
Or laugh at you
That's got to hurt
These things you should tell
Why should you justify?
Hmmmmmmmm
That's got to hurt
You handled it perfectly
But I see the hurting
Dear, in your eyes
That's got to hurt
Won't you admit
There were injustices
That's got to hurt
However poignantly
Won't let them laugh at me
You're ever you
You might also likeCan I say I'm sorry if I have
Spoken out of turn
Reckless
Feckless
Careless talk
That's got to hurt
Won't you admit
There were injustices
Along the way
That's got to hurt
However poignantly
Don't let them laugh at me
Or laugh at you
That's got to hurt
Things you should tell me
Why should you justify
Deep down inside?
That's got to hurt
You handle it perfectly
The fact that you're hurting me
Comes no surprise
That's got to hurt
Don't be offended
It was not my attention
Or to put you down
Your shoulder, always
Will be there to cry on
It's got to hurt
Can I say I'm sorry if I have
Spoken out of turn
(Please forgive it)
Reckless
(I regret it)
Feckless
(Should have never ever said it)
