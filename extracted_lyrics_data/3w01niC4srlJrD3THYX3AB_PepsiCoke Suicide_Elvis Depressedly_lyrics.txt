15 ContributorsPepsi/Coke Suicide Lyrics
Truest love
Void on fire
You have haunted my desire

Always real, always right
Always alright

Live across
Heaven's blood
I am forgetting to be someone

Always real, always right
Always alright

Kill me as
I become
The dull aching heart of everyone

Always real, always right
Always alrightYou might also like15Embed
