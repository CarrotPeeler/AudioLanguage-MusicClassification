1 ContributorLong Way Out Lyrics
(dark shadow)

Hm hm, we ain't playing no games with you
We got Glocks and sticks at you
He trynna go step but I told him ask Ju'
And she throwing me off I'm feeling real blue
I just fill up my cup till my body feel cool
Imma do my own thing I ain't following no rules
I been poppin out trim ever since in the womb
Hm, Nigga taught that he won we got hit him like two (2x)

Hm yah, we finna hop off that leash just like Tana
Ion know where I'm going, but this bitch a random
On this beat I be flowin' big boy just like Fanum
We finna pop at his head with no hammer
We finna pop at his head with no hammer
If that boy keep on playing we gon' do his ass bad like Atlanta
I fill my double cup up with some Fanta
Why that ho' said she slayed but I told that bit' you is not Santa

I told Jupiter to come bring that .30 load mag with that brand new banana
I told Jupiter to come in that whip causе we finna go crush em, we ran еm
Nigga not EST, boy you a random
I'm a dark-plugg demon I feel like a Phantom
You might also like
I fucked that ho' cause she want my love
Bitch I'm pulling out quick I ain't putting no glove
And I hit em' with the walk I ain't talking FaZe Rug
And I'm sippin' on Wock' with the bed night bugs
They wan' see my lifestyle I'm like "Free Young Thug"
When I hit her from the back, Imma be like "uh"
All of these bitches, they play wit' my heart
But we gonna have to try and take the long way out

We got payroll in that wood
He popping out trim Nigga trynna look good
When we hop in coupe we gon' slide through yo hood
Nigga trynna fake diss we gon' pop at the uh
Play we gon' pop at his uh, play with the gang we pop through that bush
Bitches sweet, they gon play with my heart Candy Crush (Nah)

Hm hm, we ain't playing no games with you
We got Glocks and sticks at you
He trynna go step but I told him ask Ju'
And she throwing me off I'm feeling real blue
I just fill up my cup till my body feel cool
Imma do my own thing I ain't following no rules
I been poppin out trim ever since in the womb
Hm, Nigga taught that he won we got hit him like two (2x)
Yah, hm hm hit him like two, Ion even know aw you gotta take that long way out..Embed
