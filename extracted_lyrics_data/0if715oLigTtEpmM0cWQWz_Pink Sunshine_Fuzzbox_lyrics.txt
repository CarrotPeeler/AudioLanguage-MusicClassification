Go fill your suitcase with the things you haven't sold
You're slipping out
Round the back
Down the side
Meeting two friends from just down the road
No Blue Jean Hamlets and no Cashmere Romeos
Facing up
To the fact (it's a fact)
Bad Complex and Big Overlode
Full explanation... what was infatuation?
True Love (ah-ah) True Love (ah-ah)
When it's good it's wicked at the same time
Cruising all over in Pink Sunshine
Pink pink sunshine, pink pink sunshine, pink pink sunshine
Gun Metal Sunrise seize you ragged round the edge
You turn around
Both of them
Sleep away
Coffee and toast-you're back from the dead
Easy to run out but you're choosing this instead
It's got style
More or less
Heading west
High Octane and plenty of lead
The Weather Stations... promise some big salvation
True Love (ah-ah) True Love (ah-ah)

Burning all over and i feel fine
When I'm good and wicked at the same time
Cruising all over in Pink Sunshine
It's a vicious circle, in which you roam
But you've got company, you're not alone
Gray tears are swept aside, Pink Sunshine everywhere
Don't know where it's coming from
What do you care?
Pink pink sunshine, pink pink sunshine, pink pink sunshine
Go dry your eyes and run your fingers through mt hair
It's no lie
Obvious
On the bus
A minute of cool a week of somewhere
Full information... we got a specialisation
True Love (ah-ah) True Love (ah-ah)
When it's good it's wicked at the same time
Burning all over and i feel fine
When I'm good and wicked at the same time
Cruising all over in Pink Sunshine
Pink pink sunshine, pink pink sunshine, pink pink sunshineEmbed
