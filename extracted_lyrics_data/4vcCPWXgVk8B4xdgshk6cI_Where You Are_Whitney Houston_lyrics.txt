12 ContributorsWhere You Are Lyrics
I saw the news this morning
And saw your face across the screen
And as I poured my coffee
I picked up a magazine

But as I turned the page (Ooh), and stepped inside (Inside)
There you were again (There you were)
Oh, those lonely times, they never seem to end
You're too far
I know I should be there where you are

Today I did some shopping
Just had to clear my mind again
(I can't stop thinking about you)
Hopped into a taxi
And in a moment I was home
Home again

But as I turned the page (Ooh), and stepped inside (Inside)
My heart would not pretend (Not pretend)
Oh, those feelings, not those feeling, not again
You're too far
I know I should be there where you are
You might also like
Tossing and turning in my sleep (In my sleep)
I can't make it without you, now (Make it without you)
I'm gonna catch the next plane out (Next plane out)
I've got to get to where you are (Where you are)
No matter how near or far
I've got to get to where you are (Ooh)

But as I turned the page (Ooh), and stepped inside (Inside)
My heart would not pretend (Not pretend)
Oh, those lonely times, they never seem to end
You're too far
'Cause I know I should be there where you are

(I wanna be where you are) I wanna be
(I wanna be where you are) I need to be
(I wanna be where you are) Oh, I wanna be
(I wanna be where you are) Oh, I wanna be, baby
(I wanna be where you are) You know I need to be
(I wanna be where you are)
I know I should be there where you are (Ooh)Embed
