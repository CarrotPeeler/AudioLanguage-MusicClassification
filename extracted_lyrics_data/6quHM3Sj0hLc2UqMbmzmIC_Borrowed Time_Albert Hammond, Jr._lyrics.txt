3 ContributorsBorrowed Time LyricsEveryday our last with you on the walls
More and more I say but this two foots more
I don't know what, what you want from me
Well, if I find it, I will set you free
You know that I've been watching all
Ah, you have been talking to
What can I say to all that you
That you already do?You might also likeEmbed
