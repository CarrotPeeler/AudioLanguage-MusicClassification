8 ContributorsExile LyricsYou know if you let me
I'll be back with a vengeance
I'm only too happy
In our co-dependance, you know me
You know if you let me
I'll be back with a vengeance
Only too happy
In our co-dependance
I feel like
I'm far removed in my room
Exiled, exiled from your love, I fear
The sun is shining and water is clear
I'm staring out at a blank, blue sky
The perfect canvas for a sullen mind
In exile, banished from your love, I fear
It's a beautiful place but cold at night
A shipwreck, abandoned
I'm lonely on the island
It was each man for himself in the end
The crashing waves you're under
You'll sink, you'll drown, you think you'll
Lose your fight against the sea
Brave men, good men each
Have come to meet their end
Oh, can you see me sitting here all alone?
I'd face another hurricane
To get back homeYou might also like2Embed
