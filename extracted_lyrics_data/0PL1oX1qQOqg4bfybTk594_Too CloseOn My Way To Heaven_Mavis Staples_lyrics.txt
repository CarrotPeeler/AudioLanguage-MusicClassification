1 ContributorToo close/on my way to heaven LyricsI'm too close, hey, to reaching my journey's end
Lord I'm too close, to turn back living in a world of sin
I wouldn't take nothing, Lord for my journey now
You know I sure got to make it to heaven somehow
I'm too close, too close to reaching my goal
Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, I said I'm too close, too close to saving my soul
You know I'm too close
To heaven to turn around
Just can't turn around

Anyhow, anyhow, my my Lord
Down at the cross, oh Lord, You sure got around
You know that I'm on my way to heaven anyhow
Lord You may, You may shout, You may scorn
Scandalize, scandalize my name
You know that I'm on my way, I'm on my way, I'm on my way, I'm on my way
Sometimes burdened, I'm on my way, I get so tired sometimes, I'm on my way
My road get a rocky
I'm on my way, I'm on my way, I'm on my way...
I wonder, are you on you're way
I wonder, are you on you're way
I am on my way to heaven anyhow, anyhowSee Mavis Staples LiveGet tickets as low as $105You might also likeEmbed
