1 ContributorThe Game LyricsSi la vida un juego secreto
Me rindo
No quiero jugar
People acting like children
But children aren't evil
With power they are
And they play with our lives
Just a roll of the dice
And they're betting our future
The stakes are too high
Nobody gives a damn
Trying to understand
If I speak my mind
Will they deny the prize?
And If I try to stand where I can see
Will they still play the game
With you and me
Y volvemos al mismo rodeo
De siempre de nunca hacabar
Life is losing it's value so quickly
That really you just have to try
And they play with our lives
Just a roll of a dice
And they're betting our future
The stakes are too high
You might also likeNobody gives a damn
Trying to understand
If I speak my mind
Will you deny the prize?
And if I try to stand where I can see
Will they still play the game
With you and me
Roll up
Roll up
Place your bets on the table
What? you've lost?
The house wins
The house always wins
Nobody gives a damn
Nobody gives a damn
Trying to understand
If I speak my mind
Will you deny the prize?
And if I try to stand where I can see
Will they still play the game
With you and meEmbed
