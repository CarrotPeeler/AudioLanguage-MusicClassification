2 ContributorsMarvellous & Mine LyricsThe way you touch, you got a touch like gold
When we kiss and you hold me in that hold
We're full of fire fire fire fire fire
You're so good, you make me cry. fill me up
You fill me up like wine
I need to please you and hold you in my arms
And feel the fire fire fire fire fire
Ooh, when you're by my side
I feel my heart is open wide and brand
New, ooh, ooh, ooh
Everything's gonna be alright
'Cos we have so much sun inside
So baby it's no wonder that there ain't
Any other for me like you...
You are marvellous & mine
You're so much more then time
Baby you fill me up so
You're marvellous & mine
Pull me in with the treasure in those eyes
With you there's no such thing as time
There's just fire, fire, fire, fire, fire
When we kiss all that I do is sigh
We embrace end I feel like
I could die I want to hold you forever in my arms
And feel the fire, fire, fire, fire, fire
You might also likeOoh, when you're by my side
I feel my heart is open wide & brand
New, ooh, ooh, ooh
Everything's gonna be alright
Can we have so much sun inside
So baby it's no wonder there ain't
Any other for me like you...
You are marvellous & mine
You're so much more then time
Baby you fill me up so
You're marvellous & mineEmbed
