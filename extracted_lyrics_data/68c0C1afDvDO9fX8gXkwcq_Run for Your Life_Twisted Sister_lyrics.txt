2 ContributorsRun For Your Life LyricsHe wakes up in the mornin'
And he looks into the glass
His face, it reminds him
Of the long nights that have passed
And he wonders if she wonders
That he wonders about her
Well darlin', you'd better run for your life
Girl, you played with my head
You destroyed my mind
Now I'd be better off dead
You'd better run for your life
Through abused intentions
You misused my trust
Now's the time for redemption
You'd better run for your life
Girl, my life's in ruins
Pay the tab of pain
Now I'm after you and
You'd better run for your life
You'd better run for your life
You'd better run for your lifeYou might also likeEmbed
