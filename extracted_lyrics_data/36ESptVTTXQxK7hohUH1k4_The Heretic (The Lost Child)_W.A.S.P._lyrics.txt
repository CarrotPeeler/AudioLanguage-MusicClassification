4 ContributorsThe Heretic (The Lost Child) Lyrics
These fits of depression are torturing me
The lives that I seen won't breathe again
A sad child of madness, they'll never be free
Born again to die, the agonies begin
And soldiers keep coming, like warriors they die
But gangland's alive when mothers cry
'Cause hate's blind addiction's a killing machine
And it burns on the fuel of shattered lives

Lost child
Lost child

The seeds of all evil are sown in their minds
And harvest the sad fields of woe
'Cause dead boys are martyr that live on forever
But now it's too late for their souls
And standing on sanity's too fragile edge
And worship the Lord of the Flies
And wade through the slaughter you've made of thy brother
And drown in his blood then when he dies

You see in their eyes
They're the lost child
See in their eyes
You see in their eyes
They're the lost child
See in their eyes

Don't turn out the lights
'Cause there's demons in the night
And they prey on the fears in us all
They hide inside and wait
And they shun the light of day
The screams in their dreams fill us all

Children of the night, such a sad tune they write
The bloody boys that sing a wicked song
And for all of them they're just memories in the wind

Rise and see, it's the dawn of insanity
Keeper of the gates of fire
And the Heretic has said you don't have to be afraid
'Til I, until I come to get you
And child in time, on the sword's edge you ride
And cast a spell of heresy
And die in vain like a wild dog in chains
And no one can save or set you free

You see in their eyes
They're the lost child
See in their eyes
You see in their eyes
They're the lost child
See in their eyesEmbed
