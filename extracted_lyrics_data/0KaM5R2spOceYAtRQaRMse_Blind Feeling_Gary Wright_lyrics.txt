2 ContributorsBlind Feeling LyricsWell they claim that you took me away
They claim that your love came down on me
They claim that you took me away
They claim you're to blame in changing me
I have changed
Since you came
I feel release
I feel strange
You have given me space
To see where I've been
The flame of a love is high
I realize it's a mystery
You came and you saved my mind
From the fear that was near
When you rescued me
Everywhere
I see jealousy in peoples eyes
I don't care
'cause your magical power has made me realize
Blind feeling
Brought our lives together
Blind feeling
You might also likeSuddenly you came
Blind feeling
Stay with me forever
We could leave
If we wanted today
Tomorrow we'd be on the other side
Away from the judges eyes
They can't deny we're not good for each other
Pain and sorrow
And my empty past
I'm leaving behind
I know you know it too
Together alone
It's blowing my mind
Blind feeling
Brought our lives together
Blind feeling
Suddenly you came
Blind feeling
Stay with me foreverEmbed
