3 ContributorsDream Machine LyricsI I know this little boy
That lives inside you head
I know the little boy
That lives inside you head
Just dreams of the bright blue stars
That shine up in the sky
Just dreams of you sorrows
When you live another lie
The dream is all around you
It comes and it will go
This dream is all around
It will come and it will go
This god is a god one
This god is the best
This god is the good one
Jus forget all the rest
I know this little boy
That lives inside you head
I know the little boy
That lives inside you head
Just dreams of the bright blue stars
That shine up in the sky
Just dreams of you sorrows
When you live another lie
The dream is all around you
It comes and it will go
This dream is all around
It will come and it will go
This god is a god one
This god is the best
This god is the good one
Jus forget all the restYou might also likeEmbed
