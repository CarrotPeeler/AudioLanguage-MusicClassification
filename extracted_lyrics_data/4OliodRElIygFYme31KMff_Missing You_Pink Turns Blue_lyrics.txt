4 ContributorsMissing You Lyrics
I could be in Moscow
I could be in France
I could be somewhere
When I'm lost in a dance
I could win a horse
I could win a car
I would drive it to you
Cause it isn't so far

I'm missing you
I'm missing you
I'm missing you
I'm missing you

I could be somewhere
Lost in the rain
I could have umbrellas
But it is all the same
Stagger on buildings and I hear you call
I hold myself tight
Then I would not fall

I'm missing you
I'm missing you
I'm missing you
I'm missing you
You might also like

I could be in Moscow
I could be in France
I could be somewhere
When I'm lost in a dance
I could win a horse
I could win a car
I would drive it to you
Cause it isn't so far

I could be somewhere
Lost in the rain
I could have umbrellas
But it is all the same
Stagger on buildings and I hear you call
I hold myself tight
Then I would not fall

I'm missing you
I'm missing you
I'm missing you
I'm missing you
Girl, I'm missing you
Girl, I'm missing you
Girl, I'm missing you
Girl, I'm missing you

I'm missing you
I'm missing you
I'm missing you
I'm missing you
I'm missing you
I'm missing youEmbed
