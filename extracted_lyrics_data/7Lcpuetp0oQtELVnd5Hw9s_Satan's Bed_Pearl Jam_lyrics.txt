14 ContributorsSatan’s Bed Lyrics
It's not all been said, been said and done
I've never slept in Satan's bed
Although I must admit, still visits my place
Uninvited, as you know he don't wait
Funny how he always seems to fit in
Funny how I always wanna give in
Sundays, Fridays, Tuesdays, Thursdays, the same
Sometimes this special guest he don't like to leave

Already in love
Already in love
Already in love
Already

Who made, who made up, made up the myth
That we were born to be covered in bliss?
Who set the standard? Born to be rich
Such fine examples, skinny little bitch
Model, role model, roll some models in blood
Get some flesh to stick, so they look like us
I shit and I stink, I'm real, join the club
I'd stop and talk but I'm already in love
You might also like
Already in love
Already in love
Already in love
Already (in love)

Torture follows reward…
Follows torture… follows reward
Oh my word…

Never shook Satan's hand, look, see for yourself
You'd know it if I had, that shit don't come off
I'll rise and fall, let me take credit for both
Jump off a cliff don't need your help, so back off
I'll never suck Satan's dick
Again you'd see it, you know, right 'round the lips
I'll wait for an angel, but I won't hold my breath
Imagine they're busy, think I'm doin' okay

Already in love
Already in love
Already in love
Already in love
Already in love
Already in love
Already in love
(Already in love)1Embed
