1 ContributorJumper Season Lyrics
I’m know to the people, they know my sound
Lead the charge, Yh I’m heard in my town
Circle so small it’s barely a crowd
Penny for your thoughts? Na I come with the pound
Picked up the slack and ran through the mist
On my ones out here, lost in sticks
Try bleed me, my blood so thick, no time for a drip
I just come with the flow
Every big move, yh on the down low
Too many pagans out here for dough
Tryna take a slice my bread
But do you even put the pay in pagan? No?
Can you even rise from ashes, no?
Can you bring colour to the clashes, no?
Blame your fall on whitewashed world, is that even a good alibi no?
Bun that, lemme get back the kid
4 months, Spilt more ink than a squid
This year, 5K run and gig
Next year drop 5K on my wrist
Bars so fresh, call me a tictac
Tracks back to back, yh thats just a twin pack
Work till my Ps just triple like Digdat
Then let me music do its thing while I kickback
I’m living it, my style
Big moves in my rounds
Flip £200 on every turn, till I run the game
Monopoly lifestyle
My arsenal is local
Load heat, with vocals
Bars so toxic, I’ll be on every radio wave, Chernobyl
You might also likePassionate every time I make a move
Yesterday's me is who I look up to
So much so when I see myself progress it just feels like deja vu
Ah shit here we go again
A rapper who thinks he’s best with a pen
Let me stop you right there that ain’t me
Coz I write my bars on my iPhone 10
Inspiration all all around me
From the pain of the past to moment surrounding
So much so, that since the start of this track I could pen up 2 albums
Freestyling feels so comfy
Practice every day till it brings money
Learnt so much from my bro Cadet, I still study your 14 lines on Pumpy
6 months, all progress
More Spare time dedicated to the greats
Reading into ever bar, ever flow
Putting double meaning in a word, that’s genius
Dissect the beat like its musical science
Learn from each other is the worlds climate
If I ever see far, you know I’ll be standing on the shoulders of these giants
I’m still here, till I get a piece of the pie
Music is the voice that narrates  my life
Putting my all in every line
In case it ends, i wanna leave a good goodbye
Still here till I just can’t rhyme
Swear my end of days is nearby
But I don’t give a damn and I will never stop till get to the end, don’t see red light
Oh you think I’m done with shit
Na this the one item on the list with a tick
Got about 20 more ideas ima get done before your boy starts calling it quits
A novel, a film, an app, so merch, a blog, a pod and even a tour in the six
Trust me when I say my cup ran over with the all the energy that comes from within
120 on the dash when I’m chasing a win
If you don’t keep up, you’ll be gone in a blink
When your standing under my private jet is the only time you’ll be under my wing
No guidance
No silence
We move loud and proud with no violence
Only science we do is alchemy coz you know our touch like Midas
In a blink on an eyes, we gleaming
In a blink of an eyes, we demons
Don’t mistake our smiles and nice persona for moves made with no reason
Every move we make is seasoned
Scars don’t heal when it’s bleeding
These Icy bars from an icy heart, welcome to the jumper seasonEmbed
