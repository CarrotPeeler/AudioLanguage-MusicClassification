But you can't take my rock and roll
Sticks and stones can break my bones
But you can't take my rock and roll
Sticks and stones can break my bones
But you can't take my rock and roll
Sticks and stones can break my bones
But you can't take my rock and roll
Tune my mind to the station radio
My baby told me he ain't comin' back no mo'
Romeo, don't you know
You steal my pride and go
Turned me on from the old matrimonial blow
He's so stiff even music couldn't make him go
Your batteries are running low
And I ain't stayin', no, no, no
Sticks and stones can break my bones
But you can't take my rock and roll
Sticks and stones can break my bones
But you can't take my rock and roll
Sticks and stones can break my bones
But you can't take my rock and roll
Sticks and stones can break my bones
But you can't take my rock and roll

I need some man to tease before I get too old
You're movin' way to slow
So on your feet and go
Sticks and stones can break my bones
But you can't take my rock and roll
