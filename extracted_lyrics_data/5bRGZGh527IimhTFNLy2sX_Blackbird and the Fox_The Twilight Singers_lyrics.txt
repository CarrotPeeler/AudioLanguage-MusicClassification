1 ContributorBlackbird And The Fox LyricsA little bit of smoke in the sky
It's late in the evenin'
And the end of the summer burns upon your skin
It's never too late to cry
Sleep with strangers
Show you things that you've never seen
Then I'll take you home
And far below the city burns
Now they'll come as your friend and they'll warn
About all the rats in the barn
Come closer and when they disarm
They'll ask you to sit in the front of their car
Cold blooded, but some like it freezing
I keep my blood in the bone
Just when you've forsaken me
That's when I turn my blinders on
And I'll make 'em bleed for my baby bird
You are loved
By me
You are loved
You are loved
By meYou might also likeEmbed
