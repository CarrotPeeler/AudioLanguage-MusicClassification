I dream of sleep, I should be tired
I want to see the Sandman fired
Ceiling looks good, but I've seen enough
Mind races while my eyes are shut
I dream of sleep

Midnight and I'm wide awake
One, two, and I'm wide awake
Three, four, and I'm wide awake
Five o'clock, I'm wide awake

And all too soon, sun reappears
My obligations reach my ears
I welcome the sound, up and get dressed
As soon as I've had a little rest
I dream of sleep

Midnight and I'm wide awake
One, two, and I'm wide awake
Three, four, and I'm wide awake
Five o'clock, I'm wide awake
Midnight and I'm wide awake
One, two, and I'm wide awake
Three, four, and I'm wide awake
Five o'clock, I'm wide awake
