2 ContributorsIgnorance Is Bliss LyricsI find this paradise
And rest beside a river
No need to walk another mile
It seems like everyone has everything
That wishes could provide
But no one seems to smile
You won't believe me
When I tell you this is fantasy
Don't ask how long all this can last
The same old sun will rise
And make tomorrow just like yesterday
And so your time will pass
A shelter from the storm
A room without a view
A place where you belong
And like a mother's kiss
That carries you to sleep
The ignorance is bliss
One day the wind may change
And blow at your defences
And shake the ground on which you stand
One day the tide may turn
And wash away your castles in the sand
And silence rule the land
You might also likeA shelter from the storm
A room without a view
A place where you belong
And like a mother's kiss
That carries you to sleep
The ignorance is bliss
One day the wind will change
And blow away your wonderland
Blue skies will soon be overcast
One day the tide will turn
And wash away your castles in the sand
And you'll find peace, at lastEmbed
