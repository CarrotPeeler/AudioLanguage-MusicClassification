4 ContributorsCreepinâ€™ Lyrics
...And it's gon' be tonight

I can hear you sighing
Saying you'll stay beside me
Why must it be, you always creep
Into my dreams

Oh, oh, on the beach we're sitting
Hugging, squeezing, kissing
Why must it be, you always creep
Into my dreams
My my my my dreams

When I'm sleep at night, baby
I feel those moments of ecstasy
And when you sleep at night, baby
I wonder do I creep into your dreams
Or could it be I sleep alone in my fantasy

Oh love is so amazing (Oh oh oh oh)
Guess you will be staying
So let it be that you always creep
Into sure 'nough my dreams
You might also like
(Creep creep)
My nighttime is the right time dream (Creep)
(Right time) (She creep)
Ooh, yeah, I can see you walking down the street
You don't like to walk, you creep
Into my sho'nuff dream
Dre-e-e-e-eam, yeah yeah yeah (You creep)
Creep (Creep creep)
Creep (Creep creep creep creep)
Yeah (Creep)
Ha ha, two times (Creep creep)
Hey, every time I close my eyes (She creep)
Now sing it for me four times (Creep creep creep creep)
Yeah, oh hey... (Creep) (She creep)
(Creep creep creep creep) (She creep)
(Creep)Embed
