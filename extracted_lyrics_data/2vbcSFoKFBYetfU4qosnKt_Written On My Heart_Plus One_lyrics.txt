2 ContributorsWritten on My Heart LyricsThinking how it might have been
If you had never walked into my life
I would have been nothing
Without You, where would I be?
Every moment used to feel (used to feel)
Like living through a cold and starless night
But everything's changing (it's changing)
Everything is feeling right
You, You gave me Your love, lifted me up (lifted me up)
Now I'm looking at forever
When I never thought I'd ever see that far (never see that far)
You, you're in my soul wherever I go
Now I know right from the start
Your love was written on my heart
How could I have been so blind
When you were always here so near to me
And there is no other who knows me the way
I feel You do
And You were waiting all the time
For me to come around and finally see
All the love I was missing
There You were right beside me always beside me
You might also likeYou, You gave me your love, lifted me up
Now I'm looking at forever
When I never thought I'd ever see that far (never see that far)
You, you're in my soul wherever I go
Now I know right from the start
Your love was written on my heart
You made it so easy
Your love brought out the best in me and
You are my light and my truth
I've found my destiny in You
You gave me Your love, (gave me Your love) lifted me up (lifted me up)
Now I'm looking at forever
When I never thought I'd ever see that far
You, You're in my soul wherever I go
Now I know right from the start
Your love was written on my heart
Your love was written on my heart
You're forever written on my heartEmbed
