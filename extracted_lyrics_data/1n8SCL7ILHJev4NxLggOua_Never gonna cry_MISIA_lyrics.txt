3 ContributorsNever Gonna Cry! Lyrics
*vocalizing*

I miss you everyday
Think about you all the time
Oh and I'll love you all the way
No matter how far you may be

You don't have to say "don't go"
I'll always be around
Can't you see my love's real
It's here to stay
And I'm feelin', baby

All I long to see is a different side of you
Oh be cool, but don't you ever leave
Don't you ever be untrue

You never have to say "don't go"
I'm always by your side
Oh this love nobody ever can deny
We'll testify
You might also like
Never gonna cry
If I have my place
No sorrow, no pain
Never gonna blame it on a cold winter day
So, love, do stay with me
Never slip away
If you're gonna be
To my heart so true
Again and again
I would feel your power and
It's there I'll remain
So love do stay with me
And I'll love you forevermore

Please take me everywhere
Or anywhere you wanna be
A place where no one dares to go
The promised land for you and me

I'm never gonna say don't go
Cuz baby I'm alive
Can't you hear my heart
It's pounding mighty hard, I feel so right
Never gonna cry
If I have my place
No sorrow, no pain
Never gonna blame it on a cold winter day
So, love, do stay with me
Never slip away
If you're gonna be
To my heart so true
Again and again
I would feel your power and
It's there I'll remain
So love do stay with me
And I'll love you forevermore

(Never gonna cry)
I'll love you forevermore (If you're gonna be)
Again, again, again, again, again

Never gonna cry
If I have my place
No sorrow, no pain
Never gonna blame it on a cold winter day
So, love, do stay with me
Never slip away
If you're gonna be
To my heart so true
Again and again
I would feel your power and
It's there I'll remain
So love do stay with me
And I'll love you forevermore
Never wanna cry
Never gonna blame it on a
If I have my place

If you're gonna be
Again, again
So, love, just stay with me
