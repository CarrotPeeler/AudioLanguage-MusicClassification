I don't want you to know
Too much about me... oh, no
'Cause I know you'll take advantage of the words that I say
You're looking for a way to depress me, make me pay

You don't want me to be
Too close around you, 'cause I would see
All the weak sides that you got, but which you're trying to hide
You know that I would nail you if I could nurse my pride

You're on the top when I am low
As soon as you're fading, I will grow
I don't like you, you don't like me
We're lacking energy, yeah!
We're lacking energy, we do!

It's a mindgame we play
Rule the roost, major cliche
Yeah, one of us is fit the other's going insane
And every time we think the positions will remain

You're on the top when I am low
As soon as you're fading, I will grow
I don't like you, you don't like me
We're lacking energy, yeah!
We're lacking energy!
So you got me up against the wall
And I'm only waiting for your fall
I'll get back on top and be carefree
It's not the end for me, no!
It's not the end for me!

I know we're thinking the same
And our opponent's the one to blame
Thinking this way is not something that we both longed for
Living this way is something that we never did plan
But I don't think that we'll change
'Cause we're stuck in roles as other's antipoles

You're on the top when I am low
As soon as you're fading, I will grow
I don't like you, you don't like me
We're lacking energy, yeah!
We're lacking energy!
So you got me up against the wall
And I'm only waiting for your fall
I'll get back on top and be carefree
It's not the end for me, no!
It's not the end for me!
It's not the end for me, no!
It's not the end for me!
It's not the end for me, no!
It's not the end for me!
It's not the end for me!Embed
