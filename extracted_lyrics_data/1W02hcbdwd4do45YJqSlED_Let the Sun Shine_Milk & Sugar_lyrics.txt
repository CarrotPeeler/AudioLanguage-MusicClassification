It's so lovely when its sunny...
Chorus
Let the sunshine
Let the sunshine in
The sun is shining in
The sun is shining in
I've been waiting for a sunny day
Temp went high, makes some hail
The day looks good, i see the weather's fine
The grass is high & the sun might shine
The weather to get together
I don't know rather
I should feel your touch
The weather to get together
I don't know rather
The grass is high enough
(Chorus)
Its so lovely on a sunny day
Toll looks high, come in and play
The grass looks greener over the vens
There's nothing like, itÂ´s furious
The weather to get together
I don't know rather
I should move so fast
The weather to get together
I don't know rather
Your snaking the grass... (piew)
