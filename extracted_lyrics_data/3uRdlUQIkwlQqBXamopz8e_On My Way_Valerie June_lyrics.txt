5 ContributorsOn My Way Lyrics
Went to a beautiful place one time
Didn't care nothing about a nickel or a dime
Sat there watching the river roll by
Spent my whole life with a tear in my eye

Lord, I'm on my way
Oh and it won't be long
Lord, and I'm holding on

Gravity's getting the best of me
Won't be long as far as I can see
Ashes to ashes, we all fall down
No use fighting what's sealed and bound

Lord, I'm on my way
Oh and it won't be long
You know that I'm holding on

Pushin' my weight against stone walls
Playin' a guitar given by Grandpa
He never learned to pick one tune
Gave his soul to heaven in the month of June
You might also like
Lord, and I'm on my way
Oh and it won't be long
You know that I'm holding on
I'm holding on

Lord, and I'm on my way
Oh, it won't be long
Yes, and I'm holding on
I know that I'm holding onEmbed
