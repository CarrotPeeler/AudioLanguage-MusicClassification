I can feel it taking hold
Now I am an animal
Now I am a chemical
Once again
Feel it coming through the crack
Everything is right on track
I am never coming back
Again and again and again

Everything
Everything is echoing
Is this really happening?
Again and again and again

Close enough to feel the flame
I can push you through the pain
Into you like a train
Again and again and again
I am in complete control
I am just an animal
Just a fucking chemical
Once again and again and again
You might also like
Everything
Everything is echoing
Is this really happening?
Again and again and again
Everything
Everything is echoing
I keep coming back again
Again and again and again1Embed
