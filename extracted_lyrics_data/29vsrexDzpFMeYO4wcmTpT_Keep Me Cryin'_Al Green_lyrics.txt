2 ContributorsKeep Me Cryinâ€™ Lyrics
They keep me cryin' all the time
I have to say that you keep me cryin' all the time

Well, I tried to play my music
But my music was too loud
Well, I pleased all the people
But I couldn`t please the crowd
And I got down on my knees and said
"Hey mama, won't you clear my head"

Don't you know they keep me crying all the time
Let me tell you that they keep me crying all the time
Oh, Lord, yeah, you know they they keep me moaning all the time
Somebody on my door, yeah, they keep me burning all the time

Well, I tried to run my business
But they said I can't
Just keep it to myself
Not bothering any man
Just as sure as I try
'Cause my tears in my eye
You might also like
Don't you know that they keep me cryin' all the time
Something come over me now, keep me cryin' all the time
Friend knocking at my door, but they keep me cryin', hey
Somebody callin' on the phone and they keep me cryin'
Got to move away from here, they keep me cryin' all the timeEmbed
