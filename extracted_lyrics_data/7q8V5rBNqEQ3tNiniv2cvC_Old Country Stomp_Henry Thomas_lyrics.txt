Get your partner, promenade
Promenade, go around now
Hop on this side of the room
Take your partners, promenade

I'm going away, I'm going away
I'm going away, I'm going away
I'm going back to Baltimore

Fare you well, fare you well
Fare you well, fare you well
Mr. Jimmy, Mr. Jimmy talk
Mr. Jimmy he will decide to walk

Goodbye boys, fare you well
Goodbye boys, fare you well
I'm going back to Baltimore
I'm going back to Baltimore

That's all right 'cause I'm gone
That's all right 'cause I'm gone
Come on boys, go with me
Come on boys and go with meYou might also likeEmbed
