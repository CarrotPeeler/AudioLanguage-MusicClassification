If you don't want my protection
I won't force you to live within my walls
MmmMmmm
Don't wanna be a criminal who steals
There's no escape from the jail of your conscience
When you hurt someone with your affence
The hardest wounded, in a way that won't heal
MmmMmmm
Love is all around you! Says who?
Love is all around you! Says who?
Love is all around you! Says who?
Says who?
Don't wanna be a gangsta no more
If you don't like my religion
I'll go preach my wisdom in another war
Don't wanna be a criminal who steals
I don't want money that I haven't earned
Or affection that I can't return
Love is all around you! Says who?
Love is all around you! Says who?
Love is all around you! Says who?
Says who?

No love can be won, no chain come undone
No love can be won, bells of freedom be wrong
