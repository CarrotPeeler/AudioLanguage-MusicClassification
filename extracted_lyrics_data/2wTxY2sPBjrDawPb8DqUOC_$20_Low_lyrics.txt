4 Contributors$20 LyricsA heart that won't burst
And lips that don't thirst
I thought of you first
My love is for free, my love
My love is for free
My love is for free, my love
My love is for free
The breath of a bird
A voice never heard
But you knew every word
My love is for free, my love
My love is for free
My love is for free, my love
My love is for free
The dream is enough
The price is too much
But it's nothing to us
My love is for free, my love
My love is for free
My love is for free, my love
My love is for freeYou might also like1Embed
