6 ContributorsEnd of an Empire LyricsThe time is here
Time to be brave, while others fear
Fear the stars, the moon, and the Holy Ghost
It's what lurks in the dark that scares us the most
You're damned if you do, you're damned if you don't
What tomorrow brings is still the unknown
But can you condone? How to atone?
I'm so alone
How can I know I won't bemoan?
Every tale needs its star and knave
Which part I play is yet to be unveiled
History: just what's agreed
Yet it will judge both you and me
Shields and swords will win you wars
But in the end, the battle's for our hearts
Fought by bards
We know the walls will fall!
You look back in time
No one heard the bells chime
You wonder how
How could they this allow?
You might also likeExactly the same
Are the questions aimed your way
When looking back on today
The time is here
Time to be brave, let others fear
We know the walls will fall
But out of the ashes a new day will dawn
We've enslaved the world
We have slaughtered, we've burned
All in the name of our faith
Only a fool would expect
Others to settle for anything less
The tide is about to turn
The sea has pulled away
Like small children we play
What is this?
Come take a look at all these fish!
As long as you spend
There is more for you to lend
Someone always saves us in the end
The time is here
Time to be brave, let others fear
We know the walls will fall
But out of the ashes a new day will dawn
We've enslaved the world
We have slaughtered, we've burned
All while knowing what is best
Might take a year, or ten
Generations of men
We've passed the point of no return
Fifty-three days in '53
Fifty-three steps for you to acknowledge your defeat
The last in line: Ultimus Romanorum
Evolution through revolution
A frozen river, enough to tip an empire
Stalingrad, Waterloo, Bastille, Poltava, Stamford Bridge
At Manzikert it would all end
Tough are times ahead
With care you tread
Before you know
Out we need to bow
Enjoy it while it lasts
Soon forgotten in the past
Our time here ended so fast
Open your eyes
Yourself apprise
All empires find their demise
The taller they are, the harder they fall
The snowball
Is on the roll
Open your eyes
Yourself apprise
New powers are on the rise
So strong is our faith that the world stays as is
Until it hits, like shattering glass to bits
How did this happen? How could this happen?
How could the empire fall?Embed
