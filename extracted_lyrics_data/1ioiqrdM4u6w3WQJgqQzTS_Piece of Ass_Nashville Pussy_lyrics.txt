1 ContributorPiece Of Ass LyricsWe like to rock, we like to ride
We always wanna get it on
We like it hot like a barbecue
We're gonna do it to you all night long
Turbo thrust is our mission
On the table right here in the kitchen
Yeah!
A-S-S A-S-S Hey!
We only wanna get a piece of ass
A-S-S A-S-S Hey!
We only wanna get a piece of ass
We like it 1, 2, 3, at a time
Like pigs squealing under the sheets
Hog tied and we're ready to dine
Ain't nothing like a good cut of meat
Some like it shaved, some like it bushy
Everyone wants some Nashville Pussy
Yeah!
A-S-S A-S-S Hey!
We only wanna get a piece of ass
A-S-S A-S-S Hey!
We only wanna get a piece of assYou might also likeEmbed
