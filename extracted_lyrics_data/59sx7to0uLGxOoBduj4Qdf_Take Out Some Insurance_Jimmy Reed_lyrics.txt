5 ContributorsTake Out Some Insurance LyricsIf you were to leave me baby
Say you won't be back
That would be the end of me
'Cause I'd have a heart attack
You better get some insurance on me, baby
Take out some insurance on me, baby
'Cause if ya ever, ever, said goodbye
I'm gonna haul right off and die
Darlin' an I will I love you
Long as I got breath
If we part I know sweetheart
It would worry me ta death
You better get some insurance on me, baby
Take out some insurance on me, baby
But if you ever, ever said goodbye
I'm gonna haul right off and die
Don't get no sick, an accident
'Cause I'm healthy as can be
Now if ya got any sense
You'd take the hint
And get a 'paid life', on me
You might also likeYou don't know me, baby
Like I know myself
I couldn't live if you should give
All your love ta someone else
Ya better get some insurance on me, baby
Take out some insurance on me, baby
'Cause if ya ever, ever say goodbye
I'm gonna haul right off an dieEmbed
