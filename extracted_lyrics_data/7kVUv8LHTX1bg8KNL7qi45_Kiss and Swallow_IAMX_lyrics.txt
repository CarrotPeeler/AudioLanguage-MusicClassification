4 ContributorsKiss and Swallow Lyrics
Do you pay for your crimes?
Does the punishment fit
Or drag your style to zero?
You're nothing 'til the weekend
If you think that you're the thrill
Take a look at your life
You kneel before your heroes
You're nothing 'til the weekend
Could you care for the blind?
Tell me, all in all
They're just your kind of zeros
Something for the weekend
If you think that you can spell
Make a list of the cunts you'd send to Hell and send them
Send them on the weekend

Echo, echo
I know it's a sin to kiss and swallow
Echo, echo
A kick in your head to kill the hollow
Echo, echo
I know it's a sin to kiss and swallow
Echo, echo
A kick in your head to kill the hollow
You might also like
Do you care for the blind?
Tell me, all in all
They're just your kind of zeros
Something for the weekend
If you think that you can spell
Make a list of the cunts you'd send to Hell and send them
Send them on the weekend

Echo, echo
I know it's a sin to kiss and swallow
Echo, echo
A kick in your head to kill the hollow
Echo, echo
I know it's a sin to kiss and swallow
Echo, echo
A kick in your head to kill the hollow

Are you listening?
Now, in the narrower sense
Are you listening?
I can hold you down
By candlelight
With indifference
Let the comfort stop
I love you on your right side
It happens
The promise is broken
The reason is let go
It happens
Are you listening?
I know it's a sin, but
Tell me it happens
I know it's a sin, but
Tell me it happens
Echo, echo, echo
Echo, echo, echo
Echo, echo
I know it's a sin to kiss and swallow
Echo, echo
I know it's a sin to kiss and swallow2Embed
