1 ContributorDorothy Mae Lyrics(Chester Burnett a.k.a. Howlin' Wolf)
Hurry up people, tell me 'bout Dorothy Mae
Hurry up people, tell me 'bout Dorothy Mae
She left me this mo'nin', believe she got runaway
Come back baby, try me one more time
Come back baby, try me one more time
You got me worried, well, worried mind
Feel like, baby, oh my time ain't long
(I wanna see God, yeah)
Feel like, babe, oh my time ain't long
(I wanna see God, yeah)
Beg you pardon, Lord, I treat you wrong
(Blow Wolf! Blow Wolf!)
Oh Miss Dorothy, baby don't cry no more
Oh Miss Dorothy, baby don't cry no more
Tired of you worried babe, won't you find you some place to goYou might also likeEmbed
