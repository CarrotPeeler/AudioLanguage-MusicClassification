1 ContributorNinja, Pt.3 Lyrics:
I'm here, got everything I need at the rear
I'm here even when I'm absent my shadow appears
:
You can see me now or never so remember this
Not forever here I'mma evolve as longs I live
:
Black outfit with black eyes
Dark tone set and I outshine, uh
I live it till I be the last one
I'm a file people gonna wish they could have backed up, woah
Putting out trash music, is not my thing
Imma make you lose it, cause I might bring
New things to table, when you make bell ring
In fraction of blink (woo)
Never been one like other kids
None of 'em seemed to be like me
My wishes in mind, I'm protecting in guard
Keep on keeping it hundred, still be in time, yeah
All the kids now be like gimme a WiFi
Take a time with the gaming and every second is bye-byed
Personally I never let a second to flyby
As I be planning aim I wanna reach and give hi-fives

Cause I'm a ninja
Cause I'm a ninja
Cause I'm a ninja
I am a ninja
I am a ninja I can not calm down
My katana knocks bums out
Taking a beat and chop up now
I be running under shadows
Every time I would not time out
Pull up into anywhere cause I got a mission no one knows
I am just all out (woah)

:
I'm packin' and wrappin' sentences I be rappin'
Attackin' the tacky rappers is one of my habits
I'm havin' no cappin' when instrumental's slappin'
And bangin' I snap in till I get yo mind laggin'
Now you wonder where's my ice?
And How I look sick when I make my rhymes?
Homie, heat I have is hazardous halting from hanging ice
Jewelries liquefy and I got the drip right now! (okay!)
For real though, why do you think so?
Real stars have enough light, no EGO
Bright shine I hold in vivo
Do I need stones to glow? Indeed no
Those diamonds seem like dime
Comparing to talent I hold within my mind
Road map every bit I grind
The second you get it you gonna be wide-eyed
