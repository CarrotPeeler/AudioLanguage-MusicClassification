1 ContributorMemphis Women and Chicken Lyrics
Huh-huh-huh-huh
I see the sign "Memphis 25 miles"
Goes like this

I'm headin' into Memphis, Memphis Tennessee
Is one place in this world I can get somethin' good to eat
I'm hungry for some lovin' and some fried chicken
Goes down greasy and finger-lickin'
I know just where to go, there's this woman I know
She sets it up right and lets it simmer real slow

With that Memphis women 'n' fried chicken
Memphis women 'n' fried chicken

Over on Union there's a good ol' gal
She can smoke a pig, she can fry some fowl
She got biscuits in her oven, cornbread in the pan
I get by to see her ev'ry chance I can
I catch a whiff when I turn the corner
My mouth starts to water, and I'm a goner

For that Memphis women and fried chicken
Memphis women 'n' chicken
You might also like
Yeah, I take my old guitar, and I go down on Beale
Play some good blues and get a real good meal
I don't care if whiskey ever hits my lips
Just as long as I get a taste of them barbecue ribs, yeah

Now, there's a woman up on the bluff makes her livin' makin' pies
Got them chocolate-covered fingers, dark blueberry eyes
Got the light powdered sugar sprinkled all in her hair
Her apple turnover is beyond compare
When it's hot, late and sticky and you want somethin' cool and sweet
She keeps the handle crankin' on that homemade ice cream, yeah

Memphis women and good fried chicken
Memphis women 'n' chicken, yeah

That's the thing about Memphis
Every time I come down here it speaks to my senses
It's got somethin' to do with

They got that fried chicken
They got that fried chicken, bawk, bawk
They got that fried chicken, bawk, bawk
They got that fried chicken
Down in Memphis, fried chicken
Barbecue too, uh-huh (Fried chicken)
(Fried chicken)
Come on now, you chicken (Fried chicken)
They got that (Fried chicken)
Bawk, bawk, bawk (Fried chicken)
Bawk, bawk, bawk (Fried chicken)
(Fried chicken)
Aw yes, (Fried chicken)
(Fried chicken)
(Fried chicken)
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh1Embed
