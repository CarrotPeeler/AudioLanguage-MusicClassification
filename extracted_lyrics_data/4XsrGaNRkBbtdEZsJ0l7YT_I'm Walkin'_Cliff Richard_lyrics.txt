Got no doggy for company
So I'm walkin', walkin' the blues
Every night when the sun goes down
You can see me all over town
Just a walkin', yeah walkin' the blues
When you moved out
Mr Blues moved in
Now is he walkin' me
Or am I walkin' him
All I know is that I've got nobody since you left me
I Got no doggy for company
So I'm walkin', yeah walkin' the blues
Now when you moved out
Mr Blues moved in
Hmmm is he walkin' me
Or am I walkin' him
All I know is that I got nobody since you left me
Got no doggy for company
So I'm walkin', yeah walkin' the blues
