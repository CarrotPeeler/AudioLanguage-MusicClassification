7 ContributorsDamn Shame LyricsI hid out on the front porch, I light up in my mind
I looked for me a lover, the best one I could find
He got himself a ticket on an international flight
Oh it's nothing but a goddamn shame, is what it is
Oh it's nothing but a goddamn shame
The smell of burnt exhaust drifts into the bar
It's midnight in California, it's high noon where you are
Motorcycles and booze and this dirty old perfume
Oh it's nothing but a goddamn shame, is what it is
Oh it's nothing but a goddamn shame
I tried to go to sleep in my haunted little room
The shadows are churning in the passage of the moon
It'd break my heart to tell you that I couldn't come so soon
Oh it's nothing but a goddamn shame, is what it is
Oh, it's nothing but a goddamn shame
Tell me one more time why you went away
It makes a little sense in the light of day
When evening comes around all my senses fly away
It's nothing but a goddamn shame, is what it is
Oh it's nothing but a goddamn shameYou might also likeEmbed
