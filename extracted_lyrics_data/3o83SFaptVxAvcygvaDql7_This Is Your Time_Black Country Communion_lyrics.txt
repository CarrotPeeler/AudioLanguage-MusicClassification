1 ContributorThis Is Your Time LyricsYou got to paint it upon yourself
It's written on your face
You'll find no wealth on a carpet ride
You know that life ain't no race
This is your time
It's in your hands
This is your time
To make your stand
I see it all in the tapestry
And you can taste my blood
And it is all that you want to be
Here come the tears and the flood
This is your time
It's in your hands
This is your time
To make your stand
Salvation inside you
In tales of yore
Vibration, I feel you
The station to shore
This is your time
It's in your hands
This is your time
To make your standYou might also likeEmbed
