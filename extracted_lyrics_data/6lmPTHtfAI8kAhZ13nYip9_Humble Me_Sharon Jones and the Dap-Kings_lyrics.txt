Don't let me forget who I am
Humble me, humble me
Don't let me forget who I am
When I start talkin' down
Like I'm hovering above, oh yeah
Like I'm made of something better
Oh, than what you're made of
And when you hear me asking
For all kinds of fancy things
Things you've never had, no
And things you know you can't bring
Don't be afraid to...
Humble me, humble me
Don't let me forget who I am
Humble me, humble me
Don't let me forget who I am
When I start demanding more than the rest, oh yeah
And when I start moaning that I didn't get the best
Just remind me of the man
Oooh with nothing to eat
And remind me of the other man
With no shoes on his feet
You might also likeWho let me be wasteful?
From all that I've seen and all that I have
And everywhere I've been
Make me grateful for my voice
That I might lift you up
And my legs, oh these old legs, yeah
I might jump and run to you
Make me thankful for the music
That puts my soul on high
And grateful for you people
Who comes out to hear me every night
Whoa, please...
Humble me, humble, humble me
Don't let me forget who I am
Humble me, humble me
Don't let me forget who I amEmbed
