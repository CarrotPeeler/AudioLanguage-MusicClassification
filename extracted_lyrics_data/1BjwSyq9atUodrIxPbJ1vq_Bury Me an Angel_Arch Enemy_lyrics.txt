3 ContributorsBury Me an Angel LyricsSymbolical and mystical
Between life and death we're torn
A constant struggle
Like an apocrypha
Nobody can be certain
A thousand days, spent in hell
The ultimate sacrifice
Your voyage starts
With a question mark
But the distant future
Will not tell

Bury me an angel
Set my black soul free
Blackened chariots
Bearing evil souls
Ride the surface of burning holes
Nocturnal... traveler
You represent the ruined spirit
Symbolical and mystical
You shall be damned for all time
