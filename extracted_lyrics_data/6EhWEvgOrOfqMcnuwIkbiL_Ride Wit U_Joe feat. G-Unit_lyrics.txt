14 ContributorsRide Wit U Lyrics
Everybody say (La la la la la la la la la la la la)
Yeah, it's 50 cent, and Lloyd Banks, and young Buck, and Joe
G-Unit!

Baby I wanna rock 'n' roll with you, tear tha club up
And still hit them blocks and shows with you
Can you picture me and you not even friends, no crew? (C'mon)
We gonna do whatever you wanna do
I'll take ya mind off whatever you goin through (Woo!)
Just sit back and relax to the sound of the sax
I'm hood but that don't mean I ride around with the rats
I work and make you lose a couple pounds in the sack

Look at what we got right here such a work of art
Someone I'll give my heart to any thing, its what I'll do
Just so that she would be mine, I give her all my time
Every part of me, my mind, soul, and my body what's up?
I wanna..

Ride with ya, ride with ya
I wanna move with ya, move with ya, move with ya
I wanna ride with ya, ride with ya, ride with ya
I wanna move with ya, move with ya, move with ya
