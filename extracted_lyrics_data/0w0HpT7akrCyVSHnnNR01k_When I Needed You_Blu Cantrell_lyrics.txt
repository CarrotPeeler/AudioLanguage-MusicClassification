2 ContributorsWhen I Needed You Lyrics
See, it's a damn shame
You got caught up in the game
So much to offer
But so little to give, yeah yeah
Now you're runnin' around
Tryna to get down
With every trick in town
Tell me why you had me waitin' by the phone, all alone

Oh, I need a man that wants all of me
'Cause I need to give someone all of me
I don't wanna have to ask
Where were you when I needed you?
Oh, I need a man that wants all of me
'Cause I need to give someone all of me (All of me)
I don't wanna have to ask
Where were you when I needed you?

Now I've tried and tried
To make you realize
That here's where you wanna be
But you didn't wanna listen to me
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Now I got somebody new
Who does all the things that you didn't do
Could've been you
Baby, baby
Could've been you
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Oh, I need a man that wants all of me (All of me)
'Cause I need to give someone all of me (Oh)
I don't wanna have to ask
Where were you when I needed you?
I need a man that wants all of me (Oh-oh-oh)
'Cause I need to give someone all of me (Whoa)
I don't wanna have to ask (I don't wanna have to ask, yeah)
Where were you when I needed you?

I need someone to take the pain away
Change the rain and the cloudy days
I hoped and prayed that person would be you
But, baby, when it's all said and done
I'm gonna be the only one to take care of me
So look out for Blu

Oh, I need a man that wants all of me
'Cause I need to give someone all of me (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I don't wanna have to ask (I don't wanna have to ask, yeah, yeah)
Where were you when I needed you?
I need a man who wants all of me (All of me)
'Cause I need to give someone all of me (Whoa, whoa)
I don't wanna have to ask (Oh, whoa, whoa)
Where were you when I needed you?
I need a man that wants all of me (Give me all the love you, yeah)
'Cause I need to give someone all of me
I don't wanna have to ask (Oh-oh-oh)
Where were you when I needed you? (When I needed you)
I need a man who wants all of me
'Cause I need to give someone all of me
I don't wanna have to ask (Baby)
Where were you when I needed you? (Yeah, yeah, yeah)Embed
