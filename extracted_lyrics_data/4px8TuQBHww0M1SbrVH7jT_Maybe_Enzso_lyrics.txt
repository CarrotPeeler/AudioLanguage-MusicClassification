1 ContributorInverted Lyrics
Uh, you know how we do
It's about time to wreck crews
Select dues, get you
Now, without further ado
We about to get up in the rectum
And get inverted, inverted

Rappers get chopped like cheddar, let a cannibal texture damage your vest
A Hannibal Lecter ravage and lyrically savage
Your necks are cut from the crazier, above the trachea
For bein' lazier, my raz inside my Avirex
To surgically remove wackness, from any town
State to borough, thorough, some twenty clowns bait the zeros
 never, the hero severs like a cuisine art
You teasin' start my art and bleedin' parts to seize your heart
Spark MC's in dark rituals to get reduced
It's habitual, the gifted bruises is what I give to crews original
You missin' too, chills your posse, that's what I see
Plus that's highly incompetent, rhyme is sloppy
Try to copy, the sinus got me bubblin'
Subtle muddles bubblin', you know it's trouble when I'm cuddlin' your cranium
Any rapper, you name me 'em, I'll vaporize
And angels plagiarize, like grades inflate your eyes
What I display defies the force of nature,  I hate ya
Decapitate ya with the quickness, if there's a witness
Then you feel a sickness to get with
The Holy Grail and a pale full of body parts
You get inverted when the party starts
You might also like
I'm inverted, niggas layin' lyrically murdered
Inverted, inverted, inverted
I'm inverted, niggas layin' lyrically murdered
Inverted, inverted, inverted

The inverted's verdict, see I murdered, toys crazy
My choice lately's to flip your ass like  crazy
Or maybe enzo, my lady friends go in the Benzos
Snitches get put away like Sugar Ray but it depends though
On how your end goes, suppose some sin , it's all a 
You men know, they goin' out the fuckin' window
Like endo smoke chokin', gropin' your windpipe
I'm open, dope scopin', soakin' your men like
A shower, now my power devours like Akira
Throughout my era, my peers are less then the Lira
Clearin' a Crystal, fearin' the pistol for his style
I'm hearin' his style with foul intentions with the 
Dominate the weak and wicked, to be specific (Yeah)
This seems explicit, livid, severin' your gizzard with liquid
Acid, I'm passionate as cashin' this
So I ain't passin it, tactics'll mash you kid when my 
I'm maskin' kids from the veil of secrecy
Defeatin' me's ill, throughout my nuts is how you eatin' me
Inverted, niggas are layin' down lyrically murdered
Inverted, inverted, inverted, yo
Inverted, niggas are layin' down lyrically murdered
Inverted, inverted, inverted, yo

Try the best writer, your best tiers
You left dire, prior to this you piss fire
But I attack the , semi and like a semi 
 Gorilla killer, the  like Indians
Me and my man we in a heated battle with the industry
You makin' records, we takin' checkered motherfuckers
Fakin' efforts to come up, you better dumb up
Before you run up on a tonner,  done your underground clown
Sounds, poundin' my round just up a merciless
So what you workin' with? My verses kick herb and verbs to shit
The nerves of kids fixed with temperature, don't make the emperor
Get into ya, Body Gotti, like shots from a shottie, sloppy
To injure your mossy, optics begin to get foggy
Now see your avenues, slashin' your clavicle
My raps from fatter crew and actual, natural raps at you
But tragical, we stagger crews when massin' clues
Pass the loot, your staff laughs at you
The magical deciphers all types of competition
When Don imprisons minds, you find incisions for auditions
Inverted, niggas are layin' down lyrically murdered
Inverted, inverted, inverted
Inverted, niggas are layin' down lyrically murdered
Inverted, inverted, inverted
Inverted, niggas are layin' down lyrically murdered
Inverted, inverted, inverted
Inverted, niggas are layin' down lyrically murdered
Inverted, inverted, inverted

Yeah
Piece to Stretch, Armstrong and Bobbito
Yeah, you know how we go
For years bringin' tears to peers
Uh-huh, , Crown Jewels
Definitely love in the first degree
My brother OC, yeah, Organized Konfusion
Kool Keith, Natural Elementz
And all of Queens, all of Brooklyn
You know how it is, yeah, we got to do it like that
And now we out, uh
Long Isle, Flatbush, , uh-huh
And we outEmbed
