Nigga born, Let nigga music go to your head
Nigga born, Let nigga music go to your head
Nigga born, Let nigga music go to your head
We're gonna dance, dance, dance
Show you some rhythm
We'll entrance the mainframe
Who invented the "ism", the "ism"
Like : Racism, Hateism, Blacks in a trap!
Colonialism, Money reasons, Sell them all back!
Cuz they're nigga born
They let nigga music go to your head
Nigga born, Let nigga music go to your head
Nigga born, nigga bred
Let nigga music go to your head
Nigga born, Let nigga music go to your head
Head
It's a scene we all have seen in our heads
It's a dream we all have been in our beds
Maybe not nigga born
But nigga bred
You might also likeI'm being chased, chased, chased!
By members of the underworld
Well connected with members of the afterlife
I'm being chased, chased!
By memories in color, when people loved each other
No matter if you're black or white
Nigga born, Let nigga music go to your head
Nigga born, Let nigga music go to your head
Nigga born, nigga bred
Let nigga music go to your head
Nigga born, Let nigga music go to your headEmbed
