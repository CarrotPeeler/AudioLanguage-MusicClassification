5 ContributorsTo Ride, Shoot Straight and Speak the Truth Lyrics
Got a god and her bless
I want everything she offers and won't settle for less
I see heaven under my feet as well as over my head
Bet you wish you were already dead
Always less done than said

Met this guy who knows why
He said "I know where you go when you die"
Told him how I felt for his god and that I wasn't impressed
You see, I'm already blessed

I, I wanna ride, gun in my hand and God on my side
I've tried, so far no good
More than a little misunderstood

Love the fall, no control
They say "It takes one to know one"
Well I know them all
They say "stupid is as stupid does"
Guess you'll always be if you ever was

I, I wanna ride, gun in my hand and God on my side
I've tried, so far no good
More than a little misunderstood
