1 ContributorGothic People LyricsShe came for me, she had a thirst for knowledge
She studied English at some Sheffield College
That's where I
Caught her eye
She told me that her dad was loaded
I said "In that case, I'll have black and lager"
She said, "fine"
And then in 30 seconds time, she said:
"I wanna live like gothic people
I wanna do whatever gothic people do
Wanna sleep with gothic people
I wanna sleep with gothic people like you"
Well, what else could I do?
I said, "Ah, I'll see what I can do."
I took her to the gothic market
I don't know why, but I had to start it somewhere
So I started there
I said, "Pretend you've got no money"
She just laughed and said, "Ha, you're so funny"
I said, "Yeah? But I don't see anyone else smiling in here
Are you sure
You might also likeYou wanna live like gothic people
You wanna see whatever gothic people see
Wanna sleep with gothic people
You wanna sleep with gothic people like me?"
But she didn't understand
She just frowned and held my hand
Rent a flat above a shop
Dye your hair and quit your job
Take some speed and act real cool
Pretend ya went to public school
Still, you'll never get it right
'Cause when you're layin' in bed at night
Revering Eldritch on the walls
If you called your daddy he'd stop you, oh yeah
You'll never live like gothic people
You'll never do what gothic people do
Never fail like gothic people
Never watch your mind slide out of view
And then dance, drink, and screw
'Cause there's nothin' else to do
Sing along with the gothic people
Ah, sing along and it might just get you through
Laugh along with the gothic people
Yeah, laugh along even though they're laughing at you
And those stupid things that you do
Because you think goth's so cool
I wanna live with...gothic people
I wanna live with...gothic people
I wanna live with...gothic people like you
Wanna live with...gothic people like you
Live with gothic people like you
Live with gothic people like you
Wanna live with gothic people
I wanna live with gothic people
Wanna live with gothic people like you
Wanna live with gothic people like you
Wanna live with gothic people like you
Oh yeahEmbed
