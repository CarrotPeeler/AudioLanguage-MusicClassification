Wanna be a great dark man
Nothing but a lesbian
You are perfect, you are sheer
If you are a red-haired queer
That's life: one dies
C'est la vie, ma cherie
But it really doesn't matter

No G.D.M
No great dark man
No G.D.M
No great dark man

There won't be a great dark man
If I am a red-haired queer
You are perfect, you are sheer
If you are a red-haired queer
Tel Aviv, have a sniff
C'est la vie, ma cherie
But it really doesn't matter
You might also like
Yellow teeth between pink lips
Eyeline shadow with a crazy look
The jewel behind my lobe of ear
Rouge on my face hides my beard
Long, violet fingernails
I adore those magic tales
I don't mind
I don't mind
Hahaha

No G.D.M
No great dark man
No G.D.M
No great dark man

Wanna be a great dark man
(No G.D.M)
Being but a lesbian
(No great dark man)
You are perfect, you are sheer
(No G.D.M)
If you are a red-haired queer
(No great dark man)

That's life: one dies
C'est la vie, ma cherie
Tel Aviv, have a sniff
That's life: one dies
C'est la vie, ma cherie
Tel Aviv, have a sniff
That's life: one dies
C'est la vie, ma cherie
Tel Aviv, have a sniff
That's life: one dies
C'est la vie, ma cherie
Tel Aviv, have a sniff
That's life: one dies
C'est la vie, ma cherie
Tel Aviv, have a sniffEmbed
