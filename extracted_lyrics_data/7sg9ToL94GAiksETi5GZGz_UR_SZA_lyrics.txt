Clarity is a state of mind
Freedom ain't real, who's sold you that lie?
I ain't buying it
No matter what the price (One more time? Alright)
So give it up, give it up, mama
Undo your pants and your bra
I see you liking that, you must need a slice
Type A personality
Extrovert, introvert, commonalities
A Type A personality
Just dumb enough to lie to me

You are, you are, you are, you are
You are, you are, you are, you are (We are)
You are, you are, you are, you are (We are)
You are, you are, you are, you are

Superficial superwoman
Ain't you tired of that wind in your face?
Your skin taste likes Brussels sprouts I swear
Can't seem to remember your face
So give it up, give it up papa
Make it make sense to me
I can not go any further
Than two steps in-front of me, I'm lost here
