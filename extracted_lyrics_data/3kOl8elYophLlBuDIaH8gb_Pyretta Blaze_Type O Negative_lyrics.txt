Beautiful yet dangerous
Thermogenic, luminous
Like a moth drawn to a flame
I'm the same
All cremated equally

As a spark still I knew
I'll be lured, be consumed
She a pyre incarnate, incinerate
An inferno turned to flesh

You are the first
Will be my last
Will be my final words
(Said she)
Ah, Pyretta Blaze
You are the first
Will be my last
Will be my final words
(Said she)
Ah, Pyretta Blaze

Say the words
I long to hear
Pinch, bite, kiss, suck, lick and sear
In a pyromantic way
I'm her slave
Living for her to ignite
You might also like
You are the first
Will be my last
Will be my final words
(Said she)
Ah, Pyretta Blaze
You are the first
Will be my last
Will be my final words
(Said she)
Ah, Pyretta Blaze
You are the first
Will be my last
Will be my final words
(Said she)
Ah, Pyretta Blaze
You are the first
Will be my last
Will be my final words
(Said she)
Ah, Pyretta Blaze

(Said she)
Ah, Pyretta Blaze
(Said she)
Ah, Pyretta Blaze
(Said she)
Ah, Pyretta Blaze1Embed
