1 ContributorTake You There LyricsThere's a place that I know
Where people want to go
When they wanna get out of the city
If you want to go
We can get you there in a hurry
People walkin' round enjoying the sumemr day
No working no feel the warmth of the sunshine's rays
Little children playin' down by the riverside
Underneath the bridge with the girl that you like
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, yeah
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, yeah
We can take you there
We can take you there
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, yeah
We can take you there
We can take you there
There's a place that I know
Where the people want to go
When they wanna get out of the city
If you want to go
I'll get you there in a hurry
People walking round and round and round
My boss called me
Today to work
You know what I dold him right
No working now, no working now, no working now
People walking round enjoying the sunshine rays
Little children playin' down by the riverside
Underneath the bridge with the girl that you like
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, yeah
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, yeahYou might also likeEmbed
