Oh, oh
Yea oh begin
Picture a girl name free chrysanthemum moon
Sitting in asphalt corner decorating her room
With 50,000 rainbow-colored seagulls rising (rising)
She wears her clothes like a Middle Eastern bazaar
Listens to Marvin Gaye sing "What's Goin' On?"
Brother, brother it's time to set our dreams free-flying
Put up a poster - express yourself
(Express yourself)
Oh no, no, no
Put up a poster for yourself
(For yourself)
In Lincoln's country, some still try and repress
All of the choices we have
And all of the choices we made
Brother lift your words to the sun
You just put up a poster - express yourself
(Express yourself)
(Oh no, no, no)
Just put up a poster for yourself
(For yourself)
(Imagine how the bells will ring)
(When you can put up a poster for anything)
From the clouds on a trampoline
She writes graffiti again
Freedom is the creation
Blessed are the noises who inspire you mankind
To seek the truth of their own sensations
These are the days for painting under the stars
(These are the days for painting under the stars)
These are new days of song
(These are new days of song)
Where ideas fly through a world of magic emotion
Imagine somebody like chrysanthemum moon
(Chrysanthemum moon)
On a trapeze with ease over the seven seas
{Over the seven seas)
In the arc of a rainbow she says
Let voices carry
Put up a poster - express yourself
(Express yourself)
(Oh no, no, no)
Just put up a poster for yourself
(For yourself)
(Imagine how the bells will ring)
(When you can put up a poster for anything)
Put up a poster baby now stand up let your voice be heard
Put up a poster baby now stand up take your ground with me
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
(Put up a poster express yourself)
(Put up a poster)
(Put up a poster)
(Put up a poster)
Put up a poster, yeaYou might also likeEmbed
