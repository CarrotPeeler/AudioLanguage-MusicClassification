3 ContributorsTouch Me There Lyrics
Hey (Forever)
Hey (Tonight we'll fly to heaven)

One turn, we had not passed by your smile
Free me from rules, for only one night
Desirable as you are, tryin' to keep myself in line
Although your movement feels so right
Keep my glory high

Touch me here, baby
Won't you kiss me there?
Let's dance away forever
I like the way you're groovin'
Like you just don't care
Tonight we'll fly to heaven

Caress my body and my soul
I need to take care of, I'm just a little girl
Not asking for a razor faced lover
Don't make me scared, don't push me in to your arms
I'll find me softly, your affection
Bring it to me
You might also like
Touch me here, baby
Won't you kiss me there?
Let's dance away forever
I like the way you're groovin'
Like you just don't care
Tonight we'll fly to heaven

You're such an oversimplified boy
I never thought that it would matter to me
And even when I try to keep my distance
I see your eyes lightnin', my face starts to glow
Your power makes me feel so shy
Keep my glory high

Touch me here, baby
Won't you kiss me there?
Let's dance away forever
I like the way you're groovin'
Like you just don't care
Tonight we'll fly to heaven

Kiss (Mm, mm)
Kiss (Oh, yeah)
I'll find me softly, your affection
You gotta bring it to me
Your power makes me feel so shy, shy, shy, ooh
Keep my glory high, keep my glory high
(Touch me here, baby
Won't you kiss me there?)
Baby tonight (Forever)
I like the way you're groovin'
Like you just don't care
Tonight we'll fly to heaven
I said I
(Touch me here, baby
Won't you kiss me there?)
Touch me, baby
Dance away forever
I like the way you're groovin'
(Tonight we'll fly to heaven)
Baby, together
(Touch me here, baby
Won't you kiss me there?)
Won't you kiss me there?
(Forever) Forever, forever
(Tonight we'll fly to heaven)Embed
