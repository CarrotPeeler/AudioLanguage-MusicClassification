2 Contributors400 Bucks LyricsI said Honey
I sent you 400 bucks
So you could buy some car
Well I loved you so much
I didn't get too far
For my 400 bucks
You were sweet that day
I guess I should of known
That you'd never repay
400 bucks 400 bucks
And you don't give a fuck
About my 400 bucks
A '57 sedan
And it's a mom and pop car
And now your old boyfriend's back
My only friend's at the bar
400 buck 400 bucks
And you don't give a fuck
About my 400 bucks
You got a new puppy dog
Threw your cat on the street
And now we're both fucked
Without my 400 bucks

And you don't give a fuck
About my 400 bucks
Spoken:
Remember when you said Honey
Someday that car is gonna look so good in front of our house
BITCH! I want my 400 dollars
I want my 400 dollars and I want it right now
Give it to me!Embed
