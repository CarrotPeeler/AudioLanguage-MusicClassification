4 ContributorsLittle Victories LyricsThis time
I'll be sailing
No more bailing boats for me
I'll be out here on the sea
Just my confidence and me
And I'll be awful sometimes
Weakened to my knees
But I'll learn to get by
On the little victories
This time
I'll have no fear
I'll be standing strong and tall
Turn my back towards them all
And I'll be awful sometimes
Weakened to my knees
But I'll learn to get by
Yeah I'll learn to get by
On the little victories
And if the world decides to catch up with me
It's a little victorySee Matt Nathanson LiveGet tickets as low as $64You might also likeEmbed
