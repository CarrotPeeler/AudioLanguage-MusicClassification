1 ContributorBlack Boys Lyrics: Black boys are delicious
Chocolate flavored love
Licorice lips like candy
Keep my cocoa handy
I have such a sweet tooth when it comes to love
: Once I tried a diet of quiet, rest, no sweets
: But I went nearly crazy
And I went clearly crazy
Because I really craved for
: Chocolate flavored treats
: Black boys are nutritious
: Black boys fill me up
Black boys are so damn yummy
: They satisfy my tummy
 I have such a sweet tooth
When it comes to love
Black black
