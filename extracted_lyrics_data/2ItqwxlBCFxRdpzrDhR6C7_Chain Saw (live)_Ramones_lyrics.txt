1 ContributorTo Black Thought, my Hero LyricsSince the last time y'all seen me, I pass time all cleaning
Pack nines, fought demons, attack mics, cross needs a
Break, see me shake, as I ween and wait, fiend for days
Then me will say, emcees today need to make less than three mistakes
Yo
Todo quiero, tu amor, tu alma y tu cuerpo
Por una noche, por tu me coste, paga o muero
El número razones, no zero, pero million, y yo muertos
Impresión de tu es incorrecto, pero ahora tengo mi intelecto
Tengo no defectos
Will I make it to the age where kids get raised for days and years
Will I live to see the day I get over all my crazy fears
Spent most of my youth tasting tears, you may take me weird
I'm in a elevated tier, and still I couldn't make it here
Yet, cause Ima bend a throat the day I end up broke
I'll keep creeping, peep secrets, actions got messed up tho
Gotta get the dough, even if for nights I get a cold
Standard? I set it yo! Come and get it bro! You better know
Lyrical killer, empirical realist, spiritually guided
To know that in the United States, shit is divided
I got minuscule bias, on a drought surrounded by literal fires
In my environ, there's a shit ton of pitiful drivers
You like the way I ignite tonight with rhyming delight
I got the prower, but tired, got no Miles to fight
I'm tight as a tightrope, death defying and nice though
I am a psycho, a Michael when I am eyeing the title
But will I live to see the day I get to hold my kids
Or do anything like any motherfuckin solder did
Know and I’m lit and notice this noted sick
Flow is rich, I sold this shit for free, history’s closing this
Gimme some mango and I'll mangle your ass
Take all your massive wealth I'm like Tango and Cash
Put together, shit I know I'm boutta be good forever
Or even greater, maybe, debatable, shit I'm looking better
My hooks will get applause from y'all as I dominate you all
And I contemplate, and concentrate, and then I take the ball
Cross you over, go baseline, make a shot in your airspace
Gotta prepare great rebuttals for my blunders that I dare say
This the Disunited States of divisive traits, by the way
I wanna insight change but climate's like a microwave
I'm imported from Mars, gorgeous and dark even when I'm holding a fart, or throwing a dart or flowing this artistically knowing
I'm making history, no it is not a mystery, older hip hop is misery
Just kidding B, Melle Mel makes modern rappers look little league, literally winning, we doesn't include me fucking excuse me? Pardon my energy, pardon the synergy
I walk trailing a trail of my balls like a centipede, y'all cannot get with me
Every beautiful beach blonde beach bum that come through
Is mine, what you thought a Cali beach blonde would fuck you?
Let's dial it back, this spinal tip, Sky is so clogged don't know where the fuck my astrological sign is at
So how the fuck can I relax?
I'll remind you rap is mine, more than half the time
Nobody would ever even dare compare your stacks to mine
Cause when I stacking my palace made of dollar bills
I'm gon get double that then just maybe Ima chill
With this crazy constant thrill, and maybe won't reveal
My alias, it's zany it's Kony, homie you know me, real
Lyricism, and its hit or miss em, never getting criticism
Up in a system with six ones buy a big pen like I'm Bic Pun
You get hit? Run nigga nigga chainsaw!
I'm Hall of Fame y'all, my brains all crazy balling
Like my eyes bawling cause my ex-babe, despite caution
Bounced and pounced when she had the chance, like auctions
I mean I'm over that, no part of it makes me wanna hold a gat
But men and boys too see the end of the road like a cul-de-sac
September sixth of twenty sixteen, had shit clean
So this means if you missed me your ten speed is mince meat
I step in the recording booth so my voice can be heard
Knowing I'm nothing more than a boisterous nerd, noisy disturbed
Psychopath who is lauded cause of my choices with words
Giving my life to this music always knowing it hurts
The people that said I was destined to be the next Isaac Newton
Not realising the phenomenal talent that I am using
To better and further myself and further my wealth
Being earnest as hell, Cee Jay's no longer hurting himself
With bottles of booze, this is now all that I do
Writing rhymes while I'm locked in a room, this is my gospel, my truth
My life's a vehicle, I wanna put it in full throttle and vroom
Never wary about how many fuckin obstacles loom
But no matter what other rapper's face I trample
I ain't going anywhere yet, swear my duration's ample
You're tuned in to me, no need to change the channel
On the crazy asshole who leaves the game laid to waste, dismantled
I met this girl who was nineteen years aged
Appeared paid, told her I liked her in a weird way
And as tears sprayed in my face from her laughter
I'm fucking sad, I'm brought down to Earth, under Saturn
Next tune is next to Neptune, what's the best move?
I got game, high octane, cock, aim, drop flames, I'll get to
You if I have to overstep my respect to step over you
Know the truth, this single's smack I never sold to you
I'm an older cute guy, I own twenty two blue ties
For my red suit that I wear when I get loot, my two times
Of doing lines got me so confused and I
Would never choose to abuse my beautifully designed
Rhymes, I'm usually resigned til I get realigned with facts
I've timed this track, produced and wrote it with a stylus, black
Wretched nights cloud my mind til you get wrecked right
I'm high and I rule, on my way to kill spiders like a tektite
I know this guy named Udonis, you'd honestly
Hassle him, obviously passionate bout all of this rapping shit, possibly
Act as if I already made it to fame and earned a vacation
And basically break away with my money, I scrape the plate and
Take the bait, hoping that you're crazy face
Stays away my fate for days in a blatant way
No taking away the gold I wrote, you know the quotes
Okie dokie, flow is so sweet, rippin apart this old ass cold
Beat, you should know me to be the overlord and goat of this
Asked if you noticed if this song's as cold as soldiers in
Russia, I don't choke but I hold my throat when I'm going in
Bold, not sold out, poet in his prime, the king? You know it is
Cross on the beat, getting y'all to your feet
I don't fall, when I sleep, I talk and call you at three
A.M., I stay trendy, take plenty of advice cause I'm fuckin nice
Dunked a bucket of ice, poured up under your eyes
I'll blind your sight if I time this rhyme right
I'm so crazy I'd get my mind knifed, lobotomy, nine times
Out of ten, jump out of bed, and rhymes tumble out my head
I can rhyme around a thousand vets in astounding sets
Hearing me you're bound to sweat, I'm crowned the best
By default, through times I fall, I sound depressed
But I'm out here blessed, with money and family
Through circumstances man or God just can't plan and we
Can't ignore all the calamities, in this Amityville Horror
I'll still haunt ya
Let's dial it back, this spinal tip
Sky is so clogged don't know where the fuck my sign is at
I hear ya say it, a blanket statement
That your space ain't racist
Fake it, make it, and let fate dictate you never face it
Depression set my session on Earth for me to lose in this life
Allusions to white privilege is what you do, you don't do it through strife
Struggle and hardships, fucked up, it started, four hundred years ago
A race for sale, placement for failure, you blatantly adhered to gold
Appeared to hold a stranglehold, the government isn't the same
They appearance insane, exists in the brains of kids that they've slain
From the world of crime, convicted with no probable cause
The profits we lost make light of all the prophets who fought, now pause
A second, let me get irate, my fate's to evade flames, I'm a fire escape
I'm not complacent therefore I never cooperate, Damn I gotta lot to say!
Cory was born in ninenty four, haunted, might be scorned
Slightly bored, but he has a family  that he's fighting for
The shoes he wears might be torn, clothes are likely worn
Before, he got a car he couldn't buy just to spite a Ford, (afford)
He's the guy on a bike, delightful and nice, driving his white
Bicycle home, full knowing he could die any night
But he's live and alright, car stops by him, inside there's a light
Flashing red and blue, gave the kid Cardiac like Brian Sipe
The coppas threw the hiphoppa apocryphal nonsense obstacles
To his freedom, if you could see it, there won't be a lot stopping you
From trying to step in before the three minutes breezed in, it's
The sight of him dead that's truly an obscene image
But these street police mean business
Freeze and please believe when it's our time we'll need wishes
Yo
I once knew a guy who between you and I
Would use his size, and I wasn't too surprised
He'd use and abuse your mind, beat women, like two a night
This dudes the type of nigga that deserve to get euthanized
What a beautiful time to be alive, it was
Yo I was a little innocent younging standing outside of clubs
Friends use to buy me stuff, ladies used to eye me up
I was in quicksand, cause this man drank six cans of that grimy fucking
Bottle, I was a Cus D'Amato and here was my custom motto:
I'm probably gonna die tonight but what did I know?
Four guys came out a fuckin Tahoe with a dozen tacos
They said they hit a busted pothole when a ton of cops rolled
Even undercover cops know Anton is to be left alone
That life just set the tone for the next twenty cold
Years of his life, professional, every year, he regrets them whole
He's legend though, what he coulda shoulda done only heaven knows
Didn't know what the fuck I was getting into
Shit catches up to you eventually, it's meant to
So clear your mental, listen to the words in your temple
Cause even I've stood there and watched shit I never meant to
Every coast heard of Don Anton Juan Baresi
He's calm and crazy, y'all should pay the man to call in Grady
And solve your problems often falling to partying, hardly in-
Volved, with the streets, and offered me, a part in the
History, blissfully ignorant, wishfully thinking and hoping
For a different performance rather than traditional focus
Digging in, knowing what the consequences were
Like Icarus I had ascended, burned, watching gangstas mess with curvy
Ladies I wanted to bone on my way home, but no
He owned hoes from coast to coast, before the dough
Increased and I was a beneficiary cause he noticed me
I realize just how wrong I was now as an older being
And I was so conceited, on a diet, feeling up on myself
I deserved to go to a fucking jail or a dungeon in hell
Couple refills of bubbly swills down my throat and clouds my quotes
Now I know, to be more cautious around the powerful
Didn't know what the fuck I was getting into
Shit catches up to you eventually, it's meant to
So clear your mental, listen to the words in your temple
Cause even I've stood there and watched shit I never meant to
I wrote a thousand notes on the shit I saw while with Anton
He would up and bust like Canton, when his man's gone
There wasn't a hit or shit you couldn't get Ant on
What I'm gon say in this song I know is damn wrong
Now, there was a dude we're gonna call him Vincenzo
Pulled up in a Benzo with Lorenzo smoking endo
I used to sit in detention, Tony pointed me, different directions
It'd have meant so much for Vince to be mentioned
If he was still alive, but Anton Juan always had to kill a guy
Dragged him into the hills at night, stabbed him til guts spilled outside
Really I'll never forget his last look from his realist eyes, sinking
In a pool of his blood and organs, fuck was I thinking?
After that I would go days without an eye blinking
And I wouldn't keep my lips zipped cause Tony liked my singing
And the rhymes I bring but, his style was swing
Like the people he used to hang from forest trees, here's the thing
Didn't know what the fuck I was getting into
Shit catches up to you eventually, it's meant to
So clear your mental, listen to the words in your temple
Cause even I've stood there and watched shit I never meant to
The shit I knew about and kept concealed gets worse
He should probably tell you himself, wish I could give him a guest verse
I tell the truth cause don't wanna mix and blend words
Yo, whenever chicks was around us, bitches always had to bend first
Then talk later, are y'all crazy, is what I shoulda said before
I stuck my sick raw dick inside ten or twenty whores
I was hanging with heartless niggas that just don't get remorse
As a concept, of course there's an objective side, they set the courts
In their favor, Don Anton of course was a player
More than a major money maker, with drugs he distorted the flavors
I know he played games but I never thought I'd see capers
Of how he'd beat the shit out of chicks when he needed paper
I didn't see the major move, that I had been taken to
These rapist dudes knew exactly what they came to do
I heard screams and that made me wan to escape my shoes
Hear the pain she's through as they did everything to degrade this boo
Didn't know what the fuck I was getting into
Shit catches up to you eventually, it's meant to
So clear your mental, listen to the words in your temple
Cause even I've stood there and watched shit I never meant to
This final verse, will rip you ears apart til your mind'll hurt
Taking you down memory lane, wondering if I am worth
Forgiving, cause to be honest, what I was supposed to do
Bruh, I know the rules, you don't place a hit on a older dude
But at times where I was so confused
Consuming flower that's edible so much I ate a fucking lotus fruit
Til guilt and paranoia made me do things soldiers do
I said "I'm getting Anton back for everything he sold to you
And you and you too, one thing to do, a taste of his medicine
That's the only way to do it don't debate this veteran
Found he's not as reserved as I thought, faked his reticence
I showed up outside of his house, quiet, a mouse, taking his residence
See the rebel and devil in me revel in peace
Better believe, asshole like Anton get vengeful diseases
Thanks for hearing my song, and I'm all rested
Verses? I went for five dog like Tribe Called Quest, kid!
Didn't know what the fuck I was getting into
Shit catches up to you eventually, it's meant to
So clear your mental, listen to the words in your temple
Cause even I've stood there and watched shit I never meant to
Never saying soo woop this ruler abuse towns
You owe me two too dude you better cool down too!You might also likeEmbed
