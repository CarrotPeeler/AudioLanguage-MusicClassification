2 ContributorsTurned to Stone LyricsI will find out in time
Which way turns you back to a shell of silence
Back to a shell of former self
Turned to stone
You, me, tied by time
In way we're so cold
Locked in a state of silence
Locked on and grab the serpent's tail
Turned to stone
Turned to stone
In time pain calls true
Enter seas of sanity
Back to a realm of certain death
Back to the realm of the living dead
Turned to stone
Turned to stone
Turned to stone
