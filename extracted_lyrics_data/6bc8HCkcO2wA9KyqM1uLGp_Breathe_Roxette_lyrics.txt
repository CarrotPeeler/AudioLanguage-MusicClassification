(Breath your love)

I've gotta come down
I've been awake for far too long
My eyes look torn
They were so strong
I wore the crown
I wrote the song
Now it's fading

My heart was open
Like a window to a summer breeze

I breathe your love
I filled my lungs and veins
And I breathe your love
Until I felt the pain
And like rain
It slipped away

I tried to find out
What love was really all about
Behind the curtain waits the sky
It's rare I feel enough to cry
I'm drying up inside

My life was open
Oh, like a window to the summer breeze

I breathe (I breathe) your love
I filled my lungs and veins
And I breathe (I breathe) your love
Until I met the pain and like rain (breathe)
It slipped away
Just like a little rain


I breathe (I breathe) your love
And nothing stayed the same
Yes, I breathe (I breathe) your love
And filled my heart in vain
Cos like rain it slipped away, oh yeah
Just like rain it swept away
(Breathe your love) I breathe your love
And nothing stayed the same
(Breathe your love)
Oh I breathe your love
Just like a little rain it slipped away
Oh I breatheEmbed
