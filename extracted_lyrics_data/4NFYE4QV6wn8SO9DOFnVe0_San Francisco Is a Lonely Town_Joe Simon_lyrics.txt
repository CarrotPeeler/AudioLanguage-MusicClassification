1 ContributorSan Francisco is a Lonely Town Lyrics
Two happy people on a Greyhound bus
We came here searching for a life for us
But the nightlife is her new life
And the only thing I've found
Is San Francisco is a lonely town (San Francisco...)

Oh, there were good times for a little while
But her new friends say I cramp her style
I guess I'm only in the way now
She don't need me hanging around
Oh, San Francisco, oh, is a lonely town

She's out there somewhere, 'cross that San Francisco Bay
She'll be wondеring where I am, when shе gets in today
Oh, let me tell you
She'll find I left her, got a one-way ticket home
And while she stands there crying, crying all alone

And while the Greyhound, oh, keep on rolling along
I tell ya, I know she'll find
San Francisco, heh... ain't nothing but a lonely town
Oh, she'll find San Francisco is a lonely town
(San Francisco...) oh San Francisco, I love you
(San Francisco...) oh, I love you
But ain't nothing but a lonely town
