It was destroyed and swept away
It is replaced by something I can't see
To stay forever and always
We really should try and talk it out
Avoid the same mistake again
But I can see there will be no doubt
Looks like we have reached the end
I'm going through changes
So many changes
I'm losing my senses
Don't know what to do
I'll go through my changes
Faster than you
Is there no one
Who feels the same as me?
I'm going through changes
So many changes
I'm losing my senses
Don't know what to do
I'm going through changes
So many changes
I'm losing my senses
Don't know what to do
I'm going through changes
I'm going through changesYou might also likeEmbed
