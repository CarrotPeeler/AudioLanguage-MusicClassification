22 Contributors5:06 A.M. (Every Strangersâ€™ Eyes) Lyrics
 Hello, you want a cup of coffee?
 Hey, turn the fucking Juke Box down
 I'm sorry, would you like a cup of coffee?
Okay, you take cream and sugar? Sure

In truck stops and hamburger joints
In Cadillac limousines, in the company of has beens
And bent-backs
And sleeping forms, on pavement steps
In libraries and railways stations
In books and banks
In the pages of history
In suicidal cavalry attacks

I recognize (Ooh)
Myself, in every stranger's eyes

And in wheelchairs, by monuments
Under tube trains and commuter accidents
In council care and county courts
At Easter fairs and seaside resorts
In drawing rooms and city morgues
In award-winning photographs, of life rafts on the China seas
In transit camps, under arc lamps
On unloading ramps, in faces blurred by rubber stamps
You might also like
I recognize (Ooh)
Myself, in every stranger's eyes

And now, from where I stand, upon this hill
I plundered from the poor
I look around, I search the skies
I shade my eyes, so nearly blind
And I see signs of half-remembered days
I hear bells that chime in strange, familiar ways

I recognize
The hope, you kindle in your eyes


It's all so easy now
As we lie here in the dark
Nothing interferes, it's obvious how to beat the tears
That threaten to snuff out the spark of our love1Embed
