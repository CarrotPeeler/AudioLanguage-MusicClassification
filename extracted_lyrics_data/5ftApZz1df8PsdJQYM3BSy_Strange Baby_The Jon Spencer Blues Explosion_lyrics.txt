1 ContributorStrange Baby LyricsWhen I get to my baby
I get some kinda crazy thrill
Do you remember talking silly?
Oh so pretty, oh, nine thirty, Capitol Hill
Like church bell ring
You struck me loud and clear
You put some crazy kinda way right between my ears
Come on now
Oh, I’m gonna get that thing
Got to do that
Aye, I’m gonna feel so strange
I’m Looking hard at your bone and meat
It’s true true love will knock you off of your feet
Strange
I find my baby
Strange
Ohh
God almighty, I feel all right
But there’s bound to be trouble in the middle of the night
Engraved, gold, embossed wedding invitation
Mama, we got to rock ‘n’ roll all across the nation
Strange
I find my baby
Strange
I find my baby, strange
Uh
Oh, come on
I find my baby so wild
So sad 
So, baby
Strange
I find my baby
Strange
I find my baby, strange
I find my baby, strange
I find my baby, strange
I find my baby
I find my baby
I find my baby, strange
I find my baby
I find my baby
I find my baby, strangeYou might also likeEmbed
