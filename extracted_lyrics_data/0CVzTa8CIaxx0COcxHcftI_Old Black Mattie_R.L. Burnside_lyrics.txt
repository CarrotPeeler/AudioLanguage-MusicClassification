Old Black Mattie ain't got a change in clothes
Girl got drunk, close that door
Poor Black Mattie ain't got change o' clothes
Girl got drunk, throwed her clothes outdoor

Goin' to Memphis, see that World's Fair
Reason I'm goin', baby, there
Goin' to Memphis, see that World's Fair
Reason I'm goin', know my baby there

Need no heater or fireplace by my bed
Women I got, cherry red
Need no heater fireplace by my bed
Woman I got, keep me cherry red
Woman I got, keep me cherry redYou might also likeEmbed
