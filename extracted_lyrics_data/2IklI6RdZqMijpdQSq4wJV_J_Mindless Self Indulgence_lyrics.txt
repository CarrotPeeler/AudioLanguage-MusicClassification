12 ContributorsJ LyricsWhite, the wall, white, the wall, white, the wall plaster never catch on
The white, the wall plaster, it never catch on
You always have to do it with a big long John
The white, the wall plaster, it never catch on
We write it in pink with the walls
And the balls and the fetus
And the pink in the walls
And the bike and the fetus
And the pink in the walls
With the stripes and the banners
'Cause the white wall never catch onYou might also likeEmbed
