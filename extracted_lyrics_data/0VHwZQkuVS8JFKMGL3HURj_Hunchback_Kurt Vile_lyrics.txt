Ain't a damn man on earth now could cure it
In the morning, I'm begging please
And I've got a will, yeah, know what, baby? I'm a hunchback
You shot me up and left me
Flopping and flipping around like a fish on a ship
You know the kind I'm talking about
Flopping and flipping around like a fish along the sand
You left me
Flopping for dead uptown like when a fish drowns outta water
You left a man neck deep in dirty water
And turned your back when he was down, down
Oh, I've got a hangover, make you just want to keel over
You don't gotta stick a four-leaf clover in your pants, you got no chance
But in the morning, I'm pleading, please
I've got a will, yeah we know by now, big as my hunchback
To get up on top these days, you gotta be a low life drifter
So slither up just like a snake upon a spiral staircaseYou might also like2Embed
