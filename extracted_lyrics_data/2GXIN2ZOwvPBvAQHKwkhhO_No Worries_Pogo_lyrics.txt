Your dreams came true

Taste it to know, out of the, beg
Was —vited, but I
Found a girl and you're
Your dreams (Your dreams) came true
Nothing compares, no worries
T-to know, out of the, beg
Was —vited, but I
Found a girl and you're
Your dreams (Your dreams) came true
Nothing compares, no worries

Get the bomb back, get the bomb back
Get the bomb back, get the bo—, get the bo—
Get the bomb back, get the bomb back
Get the bomb back, get the bo—, get the bo—
Get the bomb back, get the bomb back
Get the bomb back, get the bo—, get the bo—
Get the bomb back, get the bomb back

And that your dreams came down
And that your dreams came down
Settled down, face, heard, —minded by your
Settled down, face, heard
And that your dreams came down
And that your dreams came down
Settled down, face, heard, —minded by your
Nothing compares, no worries

Get the bomb back, get the bomb back
Get the bomb back, get the bo—, get the bo—
Get the bomb back, get the bomb back
