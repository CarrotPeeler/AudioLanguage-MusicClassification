1 ContributorIt Tears Me Up Lyrics
I saw you again today
Huh, you keep poppin' up
Everywhere I go

I see you walk with him
See you talk to him
It tears me up
It tears me up
It starts my eyes to cryin'
Oh, Lord, I just can't stop cryin'

I see him kiss your lips
Squeeze your fingertips
And it tears me up
It tears me up
I feel like I'm dyin'
Oh, I know I must be a-dyin'

It's a cold, cold world I'm livin' in
Turn my back and there you are with my best friend
Oh, sometimes we pass on the street, darlin'
You look at me as if to say, "I'm sorry, my sweet"
And maybe just being sorry be enough
Then you look back at me with those lovin' eyes
And darlin, it tears me up
You might also like
I tried walking on the other side of the street for a long time
We all face it sooner or later

When you smile at him
You never tire of him
It tears me up
It tears me up
But there ain't nothin' I can do
Baby, don't you see I'm still in love with you?
Don't you see I'm still in love with you, baby?

It tears me up so bad now
Stayin' away with somethin' I couldn't have
Don't you see I'm still in love with you, baby?
Ooh, ooh-oohEmbed
