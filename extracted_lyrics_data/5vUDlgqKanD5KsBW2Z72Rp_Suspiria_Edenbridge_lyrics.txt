3 ContributorsSuspiria LyricsIn the shades of night this phalanx is our home
We're hanging on a string we're waiting
Below electric skies in times of need we call
She is taking care she loves us all
Do dark horses dream of cybertronic sheep?
Do we fear she's laying back to sleep?

Ancient suspiria
Save our prayers give us a sign tonight
Illusions can deceive
But we're dying when you leave
Lead us into the light
In a night like this it all seems so obscure
Between the walls of dust and velvet dreams
Behind this plastic moon reality can be
The sweetest moment of our lone damned colony



Where is the final end?
Save our holy land
Your appearance is a mystery
Suspiria
Shining in energy
Suspiria
Guide our colony
Suspiria
Our virgin godess of a thousand souls
Suspiria
Where is the final end?
Suspiria
Save our holy land
Suspiria
Your appearance is a mysteryYou might also likeEmbed
