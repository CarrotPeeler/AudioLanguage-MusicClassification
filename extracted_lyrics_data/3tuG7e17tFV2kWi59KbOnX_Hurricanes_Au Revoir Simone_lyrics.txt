1 ContributorHurricanes LyricsIn a world of make-believe
Talks a lot, but can't you see
It means more to you than me
Than me
Think before you speculate
Take the fear that you create
Don't assume we're so afraid of them
And you say
Na na na na...
Na na na na...
If you stop and disappear
Doesn't sound I watch you here
When dreaming takes you when you want to be
Don't follow the status quo
Picture where you'd like to go
Take your time but always know you're there
And you say
Na na na na...
Na na na na...
Na na na na...
