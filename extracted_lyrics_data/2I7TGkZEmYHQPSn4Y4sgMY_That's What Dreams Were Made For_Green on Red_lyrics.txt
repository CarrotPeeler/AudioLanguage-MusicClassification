1 ContributorVertigo Lyrics
Benny the Jet boy I'm fast as fuck
Step on the gas till they gas me up
King of the field
We ain't gone wait for a deal
Or stunt for the cameras
You ain't gone mess with the dub, house
Young and a star feel like Cole, Sprouse
Everything better for inclement weather
Go fire for them till it's cold, out
Takin me higher
Sleepin on us now we tired, we finna get flyer
Make em retire
Singin on yall its a choir, this Shit is acquired
Rеady or not
Watchung we raiding ya block
Spinnin the globe likе a top
I need a doc, im feelin like Michael
I need a doc I'm finna go psycho

What if I can't stop it
Gone too far, my mind just lost it
I can't, no promise
Why can't you trust me, be honest
You might also like
I hit the side of ya brain call it t-bone
Shadow ya mind with the sleek flow
Leavin ya lost in ya head you a nemo
Take it right back like a repo, look at my people
Bloomfield the city, word to the badass the way that i kill it, we killin it
Feelin is intimate watchin how Watchung
The syndicate, pray for the sinners
Pastor the way i'm healing it, passed her the way that i'm feelin it
Love every second im feelin the house on a mission, no minutemen
Michelin man how we never retire we infinite gauntlet
{BRIDGE: Mark Mo}
Who gonna stop us, stop it
Making a mess in the mosh pit, gosh i'm joshin
Takin a win i don't know what a loss is
Off it baby i'm poppin, baby we poppin
Who gonna stop us, stop it
Making a mess in the mosh pit, gosh i'm joshin
Takin a win i don't know what a loss is
Off it baby i'm poppin, baby we poppin

Watchung like winning the lottery
Watch how my raps turn commodity
Watches are running all out of me
I'll want a written apology
Promised my dreams were an odyssey
We on a journey
Ran to the bag and we made off like Bernie
Talking my shit and my teeth looking pretty
Walk with a limp, all the green on me hurting
Red for your nose, all the green on me hurting
If I can't stop it
Gone too far, my mind just lost it

Big two step with the shoes and the jeans
Then I put a leg high get the juice with the team
When I catch a red eye keep it cool in the brief
Was a fool for the sneaks
Foam deposit chrome the rocket pop it watch the money start piling
Road to nonsense  plus I'm funny sweet vanilla honey bun tony Montana turn kaled
I am  too radical Fuck boutta balance
That Pen too maniacal open the callys
Pivotal moment Say fuck it it's action
I need to get to the baguettes, Do or die tryin the passion
I'm goin E.T. I get in my basket
New sun early rising  sit and I bask in
21 early mourning over bs
Ps, All of you pussies gon' see us
Sit and I meditate need no more reups
No shade to  my burners that shit not for me bruh
I start losing all my reason
Sicko psycho when I smoke soul anemic
My pen be writing all this shit don't believe  It
Reread it rewind it Just study the sequence
Covid just ended I'm taking mask off, Gym boutta max out
Me and the boys goin dummy This weekend
Monday you know that  I'm bringing the bats outs
Best in the field start placing your bets now
Vic with the kill ,The beat be bleeding
The south, The north ,The streets, We even
Hung the doors, The keys, We leaving
Lost control, Can't reach the people
Reteach the pupil, My eye is blinking
The signs are coming, That's god who speaking1Embed
