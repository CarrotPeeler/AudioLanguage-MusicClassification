My baby, my baby she's so good to me
Yes, she's so fine, as fine as a little girl should be

She got a fine pair of legs, um, and her figure is a sight to see
Yeah, she's a red hot little girl and she mean the world to me
Oh, yeah


Ah, she's fine
She's fine, oh yeah
She's fine, yeah
Oh, yeah
Ah, she's so good
A she's so good to me
Oh, yeahYou might also likeEmbed
