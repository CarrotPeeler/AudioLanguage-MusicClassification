4 ContributorsOh Yeah Lyrics
If I were a healer, I'd use my hands
I'd put a spell on you if I were a magic man
If I were Jesus, Buddha or a king
If I were a bluesman, oh, Lord, I could sing about

How I wanna be your hoochie coochie man
You got me eatin' out of your hand

(Oh yeah)
Come on, baby, tell me what you want
(Oh yeah)
Come on, baby, tell me what you need
(Oh yeah)
There ain't nothin' I wouldn't do for you
Oh yeah

When I was a young man, I, I slept around
When I turned thirty, tried to settle down
To be your doctor, preacher, teacher, that's the truth, hey
Operatin' on my knees, my soul is waterproof, and

I just wanna be your hoochie coochie man, ha
And get you eatin' out of my hand
You might also like
(Oh yeah) Woo
Now, come on, baby, tell me what you want
(Oh yeah)
Come on, baby, tell me what you need
(Oh yeah)
Ain't nothin' I wouldn't do for you
Oh yeah

Ooh, baby
Ooh, baby
Woah, yeah
Come on

Oh, baby
Ooh, yeah
Well, well, well
If I were a potter, I'd make you real
I'd mold and touch you on my spinning wheel

(Oh yeah)
Yeah, come on, baby, tell me what you want
(Oh yeah)
Come on, baby, tell me what you need
(Oh yeah)
Tell me what I can do for you
Oh yeah
I said (Oh yeah)
Come on, baby, tell me what you want
(Oh yeah)
Come on, baby, tell me what you need
(Oh yeah)
I'd do anything for you, oh
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Ha, ow, yeahEmbed
