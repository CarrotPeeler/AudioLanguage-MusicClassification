3 ContributorsChoices LyricsI've had choices
Since the day that I was born
There were voices
That told me right from wrong
If I had listened
No I wouldn't be here today
Living and dying
With the choices I made
I was tempted
By an early age I found
I liked drinking
Oh, and I never turned it down
There were loved ones
But I turned them all away
Now I'm living and dying
With the choices I made
I've had choices
Since the day that I was born
There were voices
That told me right from wrong
If I had listened
No, I wouldn't be here today
Living and dying
With the choices I made
You might also likeI guess I'm paying
For the things that I have done
If I could go back
Oh, Lord knows I'd run
But I'm still losing
This game of life I play
Living and dying
With the choices I made
I've had choices
Since the day that I was born
There were voices
That told me right from wrong
If I had listened
No, I wouldn't be here today
Living and dying
With the choices I made
Living and dying
With the choices I made...Embed
