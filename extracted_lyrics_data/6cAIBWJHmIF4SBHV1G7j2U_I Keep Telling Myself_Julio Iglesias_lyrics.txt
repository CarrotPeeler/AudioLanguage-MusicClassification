1 ContributorI Keep Telling Myself LyricsIt's the time of the night
When they turn on the lights
And lovers go out
Like we used to do
And here I am again
I find myself alone
It's no one's fault I know
Nobody's but my own
I won't listen to the part of me
The part of me that holds me
And won't let go
I keep telling myself
It was not meant to be
I keep telling myself
But my heart disagrees
No matter how many times
That I keep telling myself:
I know... I know
There's nobody else
And at the end of the night
When they turn off the lights
And lovers go out
Like we used to do
I walk the empty streets
I don't know where to go!
Without you being there
The house is not a home
You might also likeBut I'll keep walking until I can't hear
The part of me that says that...
That says I'm wrong
I keep telling myself
It was not meant to be
I keep telling myself
But my heart disagrees
No matter how many times
That I keep telling myself:
I know... I know
There's nobody else
I won't listen to the part of me
The part of me that won't let go
I keep telling myself
It was not meant to be
I keep telling myself
But my heart disagrees
No matter how many times
That I keep telling myself:
I know... I know... I know...
I keep telling myself
It was not meant to be
I keep telling myself
But my heart disagrees
No matter how many times
That I keep telling myself:
I know... I know... I know...
I keep telling myself
It was not meant to be
I keep telling myself
But my heart disagrees
No matter how many times
That I keep telling myself:
I know... I know
There's nobody elseEmbed
