7 ContributorsYou Kill Me with Silence Lyrics
You're thin ice
I should be on solid ground
An oh so quiet vice
I can hear that cracking sound
But i remain
Despite your deadly aim
To drive another lad insane
When you won't speak
My name

You kill me with silence that's your style girl you're letting me know
This deafening silence the only reason that you're in control (you're in control)
Its emotional violence i can't breathe now but i can't let go
You kill me with silence

True to life
Things are hotting up in here
If I had a knife
You could cut the atmosphere
Something else
I like this bed of nails
That's what I tell myself
Couldn't be much worse in hell
You might also like
You kill me with silence that's your style girl your letting me know
This deafening silence
The only reason that you're in control (you're in control)
It's emotional violence I can't breathe now but I can't let go
You kill me with silence
You kill me with silence
Kill me with silenceEmbed
