And the waves are the ride
The mind is unseen
And the pulses are me
Can I trust what I see?
Is there anything good?
Can I love? Can I exist?
Can I really be me?
Hurting organs
Killing feelings
Kill my feelings
Kill them all
(I am) the king of my kingdom
(I am) the judge of my domain
(I am) the voice on the radio waves
(Telling you) to run for the hills
I never meant to hurt youYou might also likeEmbed
