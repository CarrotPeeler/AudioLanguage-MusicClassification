5 ContributorsChurch on Tuesday Lyrics
And I don't believe it, is she really gone again?
And I don't believe it, is she really gone again?

I'll find a way to you someday
I'll find a way to you someday

And I don't believe it, is she really gone again?
And I don't believe it, is she really gone again?

I'll find a way to you someday
I'll find a way to you someday

Father's always smoking
And your mom's at church on Tuesday
And your brother's always drinkin' and dyin'
Father's always smoking
And your mom's at church on Tuesday
And your brother's always drinkin' and dyin'

And I don't believe it, is she really gone again?
And I don't believe it, is she really gone again?
