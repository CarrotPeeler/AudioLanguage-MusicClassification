Story of the streetlife

If you don't understand my ghetto, you should've never come round
It seems like every single day, something's bringing me down
Now there's a war in the streets, the guns blaze up the town
If you a real badman, then you'll never back down
If you don't understand my ghetto, you should've never come round
It seems like every single day, something's bringing me down
Now there's a war in the streets, the guns blaze up the town
If you a real badman, then you'll never back down
If you don't understand my ghetto, you should've never come round
(Story of a streetlife)
It seems like every single day, something's bringing me down
(Story of a streetlife)
Now there's a war in the streets, the guns blaze up the town
(This the story of a streetlife)
If you a real badman, then you'll never back down
(Story of a streetlife)

It seems like every single day, something's bringing me down
Now there's a war in the streets, the guns blaze up the town
If you're a real badman, then you'll never back down

This the story of the streetlife
