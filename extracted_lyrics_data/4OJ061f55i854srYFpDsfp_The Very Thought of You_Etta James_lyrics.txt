3 ContributorsThe Very Thought of You LyricsThe very thought of you
And I forget to do
The little ordinary things
Everyone ought to do
I'm living in a kind of daydream
I'm happy as a queen
But foolish though it may seem
To me that's everything
The mere idea of you
The longing here for you
You never know how slow the moments go
Oh, until I'm near here to you
I see your face in every flower
Your eyes in the stars above
It's just the thought of you
The very thought of you, my love
The mere idea of you
The longing here for you
You never know how slow the moments go
Oh, until I'm near here to you babe
I see your face in every flower
Your eyes, your eyes in the stars above
It's just the thought of you
The very thought of you, my love
You might also likeIt's just the thought of you, babe
The very thought of you, my, my loveEmbed
