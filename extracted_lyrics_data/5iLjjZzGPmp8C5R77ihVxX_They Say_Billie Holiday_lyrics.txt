3 ContributorsThey Say Lyrics
They say you have no lips for a fool such as I
They say you just believe in hello and goodbye
And they say that the one I admire
Isn't even remotely concerned
And that I'll go on playing with fire
Until I have learned my heart has been burned

They say I shouldn't dream of your face in the moon
They say all of my dreams will be nightmares too soon
Let them talk, let them think what they want to
If it makes them feel happy that way
I know I'll always love you
No matter what they sayYou might also likeEmbed
