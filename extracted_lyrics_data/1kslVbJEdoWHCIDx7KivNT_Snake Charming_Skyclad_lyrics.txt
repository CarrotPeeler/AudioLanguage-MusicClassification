Greet what you find if you turn enough stones
Legerdemain eyes wear the sweetest of faces
You're quick to invite into your hearts and homes
But the serpents and worms are his real kith and kin
Reptilian hiding inside human skin
Snake charming
Horns start to show with the thrill of the slaughter
True to his nature to others he's false
Mothers should lock up their blossoming daughters
He'll rape anything that has limbs and a pulse
A bastard, a blaggard of the highest order
His mind should be washed with soap and holy water
Charming the snake...
It is never too late to be charming the snake
Snake charming
The moment I strike
Just when you think I'll kiss
No good in a fight
I just wriggle and hiss
A fiend of distinction
With eyes of deceit
I am the serpent
Won't you be my Eve?
You might also likeHe's constantly searching, his eyes won't stay still, for
Something thats worth thirty pieces of silver
Charming the snake...
It is never too late to be charming the snake
Snake charming
He's welcome as Death at your wedding reception
Defying rejection, uninvited guest
One foot in your door then both legs 'neath your table
Sly as a viper, your bosom his nest
Creep like a sneak thief, snake through the grass
To kiss Cleopatra, a pain in the asp
Charming the snake...
It is never too late to be charming the snake
