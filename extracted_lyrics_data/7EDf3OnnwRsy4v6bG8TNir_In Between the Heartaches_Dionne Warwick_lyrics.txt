4 ContributorsIn Between the Heartaches LyricsIn between the heartaches
You hold me here in your arms
And say you love me
In between the heartaches
The way you kiss I can tell
You're thinking of me
I know you love me
And I that makes up
For all of the heartaches
And the sadness
And the tears
Everyone keeps asking me
Why I stay with you
The way you hurt me
They can see
Hw many times
I'm alone and blue
Wen you desert me
You and come and go
Wthout a letter
And they all say
Tat I should get up and go
They don't know
They don't know that

You hold me here in your arms
And say you love me
In between the heartaches
The way you kiss I can tell
You thinking of me
I know you love me
And that makes up
For all the heartaches
And the sadness
And the tears
They don't ever see us
In between the heartaches . . Embed
