5 ContributorsFor Your Precious Love LyricsYour precious love means more to me
Than any love could ever be
For when I wanted you
I was so lonely and blue
For that's what love will do
And darling
I'm so surprised
Oh, when I first realized
That you were fooling me
And darling, they say
That our love won't grow
But I just want to tell them
They don't know
For as long
As you're in love with me
Our love will grow wider
And deeper than any sea
And of all the things that I want
In this whole wide world
Is just for you to say
That you'll be my girl
Wanting you
I'm so lonely and blue
That's what love will doYou might also likeEmbed
