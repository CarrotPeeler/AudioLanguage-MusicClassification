1 ContributorHaunting LyricsAggression is burning
It fuels my own obsessions
The blood drains out
Inspires my inspiration
I can't breathe
I'm trapped, in concrete
Close my eyes, kill me, in my sleep
I'm just a number to them
Erratic pulses, surge
My mind in tension bleeding incisions
Restrained into submission
I can't breathe, I'm trapped, in concrete
Close my eyes, kill me, in my sleep
I'm just a number to them
The riotous are forced
Into exile, I'm not alone
Reaching the end in this cage
I can't hold on all that was me
I've come to be where I belong
I am prepared to dieYou might also likeEmbed
