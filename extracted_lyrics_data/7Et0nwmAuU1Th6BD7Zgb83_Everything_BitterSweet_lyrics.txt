1 ContributorEverything LyricsHow do I begin trying to explain
Everything I feel, so delicately paved
We are only human, we all make our mistakes
Yet you were always there to tell me it would be OK
Oh you're everything to me
Oh you're everything I need
Oh you're all that I am breathing in
I'll take a moment to recall the beauty that you are
Woke up in a haze
Quietly ashamed, trying to find my place here
On this earth again
Then your scent reminds me, how much I loved the taste of you and I together making memories full of grace
Oh you're everything to me
Oh you're everything I need
Oh you're all that I am breathing in
There's nothing more I'd rather do than lay with you again
If only I could lay with you again
Oh you're everything to me
Oh you're everything I need
Oh you're all that I am breathing in
If I may just breathe you again
Breathe you inYou might also likeEmbed
