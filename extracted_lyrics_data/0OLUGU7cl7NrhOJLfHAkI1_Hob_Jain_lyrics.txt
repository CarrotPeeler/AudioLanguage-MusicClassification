10 ContributorsHob Lyrics
Wake up in the morning, just in coffee
Life seems to me so easy
I'm just confused between my dreams and your reality
Wake up in the morning, just want to see
Your true faces looking at me
I am the same, I have not changed, I'm just growing up

I, I'm just thinking about you
You just change my life for good
Now it's time for me to thank you
And to say that I love you, bébé
I, I'm here for you anytime
If you need me, you know where I am
I'll be by your side all the time
Got to say that I love you, bébé

Lying on my bed, I just want to hold
Some of our past that passed so fast
I couldn't see it, I couldn't catch it
But our story is not finished
Lying on my bed, I just feel like
We are still in the same country
Still your bad jokes, still you weird laughs
Oh, I miss you girls, girls, girls
You might also like
Ladies, lady, lady, ladies
Only you can say that you know me
Ladies, lady, lady, ladies
Only you can say that you know me
Let any oh, let any ay, let any oh, lady djaydjaydjay
Let any ay, let any oh, let any ay, lady djaydjaydjay

I, I'm just thinking about you
You just change my life for good
Now it's time for me to thank you
And to say that I love you, bébé
I, I'm here for you anytime
If you need me you know where I am
I'll be by your side all time
Got to say that I love you, bébé

Wake up in the morning
Playing games you always win
Me cheating, you yelling at me
Wake up in the morning
I'm just smiling at everything
Never forget what you gave to me
I, I'm just thinking about you
You just change my life for good
Now it's time for me to thank you
And to say that I love you, bébéEmbed
