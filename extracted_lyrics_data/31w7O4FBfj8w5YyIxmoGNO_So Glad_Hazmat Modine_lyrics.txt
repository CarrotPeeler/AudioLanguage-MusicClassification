4 ContributorsApocalypse Buddy Lyrics
Oh my god
I can’t lie to you
Times are hard
But its okay 'cause I got you
Hovey Benjamin made this beat

Yeah, from the moment that I met you I knew you were special (special)
I had a feeling you n' I was gon' end up together (together)
Now here we are and I'm so glad that I done took my chances (for real)
Good thing we have each other lookin' at these circumstances (okay)
You say prepare for the worst but I still hope for the best (best)
Yeah these are trying times but witchu I am never stressed (stressed)
Ay, if it all falls apart and this is the end of the world
I’m just happy I can spend the end with my girl

Baby do you love me?
Even when we stuck inside the day is still sunny
I’m so fucking glad you’re my apocalypse buddy
I’m so fucking glad you’re my apocalypse buddy
Baby girl I know that you ain't in it for the money
I love you 'cause you smart and you love me 'cause I’m funny
I’m so fucking glad you’re my apocalypse buddy
I’m so fucking glad you’re my apocalypse buddy
You might also like
You made sure we were ready and stocked up on supplies (supplies)
When I got my hands dirty you were there to sanitize (san)
You helped me build the fallout bunker that’s why you a keeper
You told me 'bout the conspiracies with the lizard people
Bought me a hazmat suit, we just call that preparation
You get all your information from the Book of Revelations
You say the prophecy is coming true and this is the end of the world
I’m just happy I can spend the end with my girl

So baby do you love me?
You show me Illuminati symbols on the money
I'm so fucking glad you're my apocalypse buddy
I'm so fucking glad you're my apocalypse buddy
After the apocalypse there's no such thing as money
So we stocked up on drugs, diamonds and honey
I'm so fucking glad you're my apocalypse buddy
I'm so fucking glad you're my apocalypse buddy

Uh, yuh
Times are hard, times are hard
It's okay 'cause I got youEmbed
