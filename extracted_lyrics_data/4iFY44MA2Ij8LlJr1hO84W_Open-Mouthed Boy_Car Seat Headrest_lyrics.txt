Last night I had a dream
I dreamed that I was pregnant
I could put my hand to my stomach
And feel another heart beating
I wanted to get an abortion
I didn't know how to tell my parents
It gave me a new outlook on women
I thanked God that I wasn't one of them

Who is that open-mouthed boy?
I think I've seen him in another movie
Who is that open-mouth boy?
I think I've seen him in something else

Last weekend I had a job
I had to water the neighbor's plants
But they looked like they were dying
No matter how much water I fed them
So I looked at the sky and asked God
“Why can't you make it rain a little?”
He said “because I don't like you”
So I called him a shithead and ran away
You might also like
Who is that open-mouthed boy?
I think I've seen him in another movie
Who is that open-mouth boy?
I think I've seen him in something else
Who is that open-mouthed boy?
I think I've seen him in another movie
Who is that open-mouth boy?
I think I've seen him in something else
Who is that open-mouthed boy?
I think I've seen him in another movie
Who is that open-mouth boy?
I think I've seen him in something else
