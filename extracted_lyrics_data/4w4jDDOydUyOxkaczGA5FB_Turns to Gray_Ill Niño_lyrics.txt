2 ContributorsTurns To Gray LyricsYou will never learn to stop falling down
Unless you learn to stand up without shutting up
You will never learn to start speaking up
Unless you learn to arise (without) sacrifice
And now that I bleed for you (give me life)
And now that I side with you (I bleed)
And now that I'd die for you
But I don't know
How much more will it take
All is turning to gray
How much more will you wait
When it goes astray
How much more can you take
All is slipping away
How much more 'til you break
I know we're not afraid
You will never learn to stop lashing out
Unless you learn get up and start giving up
You will never learn to start pushing out
Unless you learn to take care through this (sacrifice)
And now that I bleed for you (give me life)
And now that I side with you (I bleed)
And now that I'd die for you
But I don't know
You might also likeHow much more will it take
All is turning to grey
How much more will you wait
When it goes astray
How much more can you take
All is slipping away
How much more 'til you break
I know we're not afraid
Give me life!
You know that I'll bleed for you
You know that I'll die by you
Die by you!
I wipe the blood that stains my face
Give me life
I carve the wound to state my case
Give me life
I separate myself
Give me life
I separate myself
Give me life
Sacrifice
Give my life
I'll die by you...Embed
