2 ContributorsIdols Lyrics
I can see you in my memories
Watching everything I do

When I walk
When I talk
You do too

I can see you taking over me
Living my life out for free

When I walk
When I talk
You do too

When I walk
When I talk
You do too

Hidden behind the idols you adore
Tell me, tell me, tell me
Which one are you today?You might also likeEmbed
