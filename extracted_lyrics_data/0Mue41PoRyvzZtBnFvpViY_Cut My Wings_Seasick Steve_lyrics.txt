Shot me down I cannot fly
Cut my wings
Shot me down I cannot fly
When I lay my head down
On my bed (?) I sure do cry
Capn how long
Must I stand your evil ways
Capn how long
Must I stand you evil ways
One day I get outta here
Its gonna be your very last day
Slide Break
Capn how long
Must I stand you evil ways
One day I get outta here
Its gonna be your very last dayYou might also likeEmbed
