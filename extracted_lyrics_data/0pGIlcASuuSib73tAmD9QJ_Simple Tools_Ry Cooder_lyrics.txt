1 ContributorSimple Tools Lyrics
Well my wife used to say she couldn't understand
Why I make my living working with my hands
She met a junk bond daddy, he broke up my home
He made his living on the telephone
Daddy spied my darling, he dialed her number then
They took off next morning and she won 't he back again
I might not be good looking and I never been to school
But I patched up my broken home using simple tools

Simple tools, simple tools, well I like simple tools
I'm just a common ordinary workaday fool
I might not be the brightest bulb or the straightest ruIe
But I can mend my broken heart using simple tools

And I can talk to girls in bars, well maybe a few
We'll drink a little glass of wine or maybe two
I might wake up in gay Paree or good old San Berdoo
'Cause the gals appreciate a man that uses simple tools
I won't be walking 'round all night wonderin' what to do
And I won't be calling up the morgue asking for you
Or beating down these memories with one of your old shoes
I'll do the job in half the time using simple tools
You might also like

Simple tools, simple tools, I like simple tools
I'm just a common ordinary workaday fool
I might not be the brightest bulb or the straightest rule
But I can do the job in half the time using simple tools
