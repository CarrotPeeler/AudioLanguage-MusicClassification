1 ContributorDonuts. Lyrics
Sweet tooth full of lethal secretions
Every tracks an ether to ya favorite artist I'll show em truly what art is
Charging with a spear like spartans, drums pierced like Bronson
Burning em like Bunsens, rappers claim they stuntin but they frontin
Nore be stunning, more be running from my literature
Melt em like s'mores my smorgasbord of chords rip cores and pores percolate
Persistent Nore the misfit dismiss weak shit with rapidity
Little be emcees they flee when feeling my acidity
Skillful obscenity to talents of the rather wack
Sugar coated batter packed raps son cut the crap
Love is what they showing when im showcasing my golden verbal
The feelings are universal
For the throne that lane im merging
Emerge with surges verses send rappers to hearses
So dapper my words are furnished in
Available with no purchasing
At least not now, eventually soon
But the money won't turn me into ghoulish coon
Or a foolish fool
You might also like
Keep ya eyes peeled and head on a swivel son
Stay true to ya dudes rule I find that being the biggest one
Niggas break when their life breaks
Due to mistakes that shake and quake they can't take it 

Nonstop with the concoctions
Thats takis hot, i be not you
Rhythmic toxins bombin on ya posse
This riddler fiddle ya noggin
With his timing in rhyming
Be honest, my verse don't need much polishing
Critical damage when cam is jamming ya chakras
May god watch me, ascend continuous like a helicopter
You thug imposters prolly making pac furious
You think you winning, god damn i hope you not serious
Breaking rictors, im metaphorically painting pictures
Im too blunt already if you got one i won't face it with you
Restate my scriptures, they'll prolly reverse ya writers block
Sparking creativity, Nore got the finest stock
Illness at its peak
Spit is like the flick of matches
Niggas shit is tragic
My stuff immaculate
When conducting magic
Causing turbulence, artists shaking with nervousness
Murder is murmured when my services is servin themEmbed
