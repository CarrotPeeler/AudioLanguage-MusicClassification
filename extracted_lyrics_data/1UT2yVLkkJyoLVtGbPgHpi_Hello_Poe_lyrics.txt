7 ContributorsHello Lyrics
La-da-da-da-da-da
Hello, hello

Hello, hello (Hello)
Are you out there?
Hmm, hmm, hmm

La-da-da-da-da-da
La-da-da-da-da-da
Hmm, hmm

M.O.D., are you out there?
I can't see your face, but you left a trace
On a data backroad that I almost erased
Not even God takes this long to get back
So get back
'Cause I hit a fork in the road
I lost my way home
Cut off from the main line
Like a disconnected modem
Hello
Tap in the code
I'll reach you below
No one should brave the underworld alone
You might also like
Hello, hello (Hello)
How do I reach you?
Hmm, hmm, hmm

La-da-da-da-da-da
La-da-da-da-da-da
Hmm, hmm
La-da-da-da-da-da
La-da-da-da-da-da
Hmm, hmm

Word has it on the wire that you don't who you are
Well, if you could jack into my brain
You'd know exactly what you mean here
Mothers are trails on stars in the night
Fathers are black holes that suck up the light
That's the memory I filed on the fringe
Along with the memory of the pain you lived in
Hello
I don't have the password, but the path is chainlinked
So if you've got the time, set up the tone to sync
Tap in the code, I'll reach you below
Hello, hello
Are you out there?
Hmm, hmm, hmm

La-da-da-da-da-da
La-da-da-da-da-da
Hmm
La-da-da-da-da-da
La-da-da-da-da-da
Hmm

Hello
Hello
Hello

Hello, hello (Hello)
How do I reach you?
Hmm, hmm

La-da-da-da-da-da
La-da-da-da-da-da
Hmm, hmm
La-da-da-da-da-da
La-da-da-da-da-da
Hmm, hmm
La-da-da-da-da-da
La-da-da-da-da-da
Hmm, hmmEmbed
