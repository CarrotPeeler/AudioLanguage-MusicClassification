2 ContributorsWhat’s My Name LyricsWell I was down, definitely
'cause she didn't give a try to me
And yes I cried, wondering why
But then came the day I dried my eyes
I was thinking: hey man what can you do
If it ain't that love waiting for you
So I got back a time when it was all mine
And love was the most overrated crime
What's my motherfucking name
So I was alone, checking my phone
Fivehundred girls hanging on
I looked through the names, started with A
Curious about what they gonna say
So many cute „she's" I haven't seen
Since they had the time of their lives with me
So I was just cool, breaking the rule
Of always thinking just about me
What's my motherfucking name
Free as a bird I was travelling 'round the world
I did see a lot of places
Lighted with so many faces
And I gave myself away
Yes I played and played and played
You might also likeNow this idea got me back here
Fivehundred nights took me just one year
Without any money, so much honey
The damn dark sky was again so sunny
And yes I'm smooth back in the groove
So many things keeping me amused
And it ain’t no shame knowing my motherfucking name
If you know how to play the game
What's my motherfucking name
What's my motherfucking name1Embed
