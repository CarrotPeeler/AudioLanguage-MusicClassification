4 ContributorsThe Spiritlord LyricsIt is he who holds the power
It is he who reflects the will
It is he who reigns the masses
It is he who urges to win
It is he who lights the fire
It is he who controls the flame
It is he who breeds hatred
It is he who withstands pain
The endless gap between servant and lord
Will grow stronger within us all
It is he who decides the course
It is he who takes the step
It is he who moves forward
It is he who worships himself
The endless gap between servant and lord
Will grow stronger within us all
From order raises chaos
In chaos there is progression
In the ruins of man's ashes
Sprouts the resurrection
A dark narcissistic dimension
A new world to come
The end of civilization
The arrival of the Spiritlord

It is he who controls the flame
It is he who breeds hatred
It is he who withstands pain
Altered perception a moral decay
A feast for the vultures circling over their prey
No care for others an individual war
Where you are enslaved or become the SpiritlordEmbed
