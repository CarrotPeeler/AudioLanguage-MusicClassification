9 ContributorsUnder the Northern Star LyricsThe icy winter is creeping near
Dark skies above us
Biting frost is in the air
Darkness surrounds us
The cold, piercing autumn breeze
Fills the longship sail
Soon the lakes and seas will freeze
And snow will lay its veil
Many years we have been away
Many oceans we have roamed
Now the North star guides us on our way
As we are headed home
The many hardships we've endured
Have brought us rich rewards
Now the North star guides us home
With cargo full of gold
Many friends died on the way
Only few of us survived
But I would gladly take their place
In Odin's hall up high
The icy winter is creeping near
Dark skies above us
Biting frost is in the air
Darkness surrounds us

Snow will lay its veil
And we will long for the summer breeze
When we can set our sailsEmbed
