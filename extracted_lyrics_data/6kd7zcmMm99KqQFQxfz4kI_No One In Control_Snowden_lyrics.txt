1 ContributorNo One In Control Lyrics
My oh my, how easy I am at a loss
Words and shirts and a cross, slip right off
Middle of a summer night you just go
For a ride and get high
And sing Nina Simone
Yeah yeah yeah yeah

I could tell that there was no one in control
And that's exactly why I liked it
And oh, how I liked it
It spin so fast that I can't hold on
And even though my teeth are deep as nails
And the only part I got

Black widows and too much salt
And that drone from that grin when you crawl
I mumble "oh dear god"
I wanted you to curb your tongue but you would not
Now that dirty mouth is all that I want
Yeah yeah yeah yeah

I could tell that there was no one in control
And that's exactly why I liked it
And oh, how I liked it
It spin so fast that I can't hold on
And even though my teeth are deep as nails
And the only part I got
You might also like
Face down in a puddle of things you left
And a mess from my head
I was not ready for all of this
Biggest crush of my whole life
And outside, your plane and train and car
Are all, all on time...
Yeah yeah yeah yeah

I could tell that there was no one in control
And that's exactly why I liked it
And oh, how I liked it
It spin so fast that I can't hold on
And even though my teeth are deep as nails
And the only part I got

I could tell that there was no one in control
And that's exactly why I liked it
And oh, how I liked it
It spin so fast that I can't hold on
And even though my teeth are deep as nails
And the only part I got

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I could tell that there was no one in control
And that's exactly why I liked it
And oh, how I liked itEmbed
