But it's doing me in
Just in case I don't ever
See you again
I had a real good time
I love the wine
I love the women and song
And the carryin' on
I had a real good time
Well, I've been around
The block a time or two
Around every corner
There's somethin' new
I had a real good time
I just love the wine
I love the women and song
And the carryin' on
I had a real good time
Well, there's a big ol'
World of opportunity
For a man who
Sings the blues
You'll learn a lot
More about life
From the things you're
Not supposed to do
You might also likeI got a way with women
Keeps 'em coming around
That's the kind of thing
That you don't turn down
I had a real good time
I just love the wine
I love the women and
Song and the carryin' on
I had a real good time
Alright

Well, there's a big ol'
World of opportunity
For a man who sings the blues
You'll learn a lot more about life
From the things you're
Not supposed to do
I got a way with women
Keeps 'em coming around
That's the kind of thing
That you don't turn down
I had a real good time
Yeah I love the wine
I love the women and song
And the carryin' on
I had a real good time
I love the women and song
And the carryin' on
I had a real good timeEmbed
