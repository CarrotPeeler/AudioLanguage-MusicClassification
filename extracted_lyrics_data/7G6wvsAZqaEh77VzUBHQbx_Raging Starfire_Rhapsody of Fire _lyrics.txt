In the winter night a lonely wolf
Defying the coldness
I recall his force to face
The long way to the north

Clash of the thunders
Might of the starlords
Rage of the ice storm
Wrath of the gods
For a new legend
Dragons and angels
Will storm the darklord
Quaking his world

The sacred flames of heaven
Forgotten winds of war
Celestial wide horizons
New golden rising dawns

The embrace of ice and snow
Could stop the bravest warrior
But the thirst for justice still
And more will warm our soul
You might also like
Clash of the thunders
Might of the starlords
Rage of the ice storm
Wrath of the gods
For a new legend
Dragons and angels
Will storm the darklord
Quaking his world

The sacred flames of heaven
Forgotten winds of war
Celestial wide horizons
New golden rising dawns

Raging wild
Divine starfire
Burn dark worlds of ice and snow
Raging wild
Divine starfire
Fates collide in your great source
Wild immortal force

Clash of the thunders
Might of the starlords
Rage of the ice storm
Wrath of the gods
For a new legend
Dragons and angels
Will storm the darklord
Quaking his world

The sacred flames of heaven
Forgotten winds of war
Celestial wide horizons
New golden rising dawns

Raging wild
Divine starfire
Burn dark worlds of ice and snow
Raging wild
Divine starfire
Fates collide in your great source
Wild immortal force
Raging wild
Divine starfire
Burn dark worlds of ice and snow
Raging wild
Divine starfire
Fates collide in your great source
Wild immortal forceEmbed
