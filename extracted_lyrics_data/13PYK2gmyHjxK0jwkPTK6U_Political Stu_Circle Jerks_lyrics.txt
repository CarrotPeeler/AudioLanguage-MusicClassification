5 ContributorsPolitical Stu LyricsCan you grasp the situation?
Or is it getting out of hand
Riots, killing in the streets
Over the color of a man
Everybody looks the same
With their head stuck in the sand
Everyone looks the same
'Til you see where they stand
Reactionary politics
Are the order of the day
It makes me really sick to
See the poor treated this way
Caviar and limousines
High finance and jelly beans
Decorate the east wing California modern
Great to be king
Did you see the demonstrations in another land
Over weapons of annihilation care of Uncle Sam?
The stock market does not reveal
The arms that you have sold
Half the world can't get a meal
The war is getting cold
See Circle Jerks LiveGet tickets as low as $70You might also likeA bushel or a barrel
Neither can be saved
You feed your beef with wasted wheat
To dominate your crave
Can you hear the foreign voices
Can you understand?
Every great civilization crumbles in the sand
Organizations and their plans
Anti swa, anti klan
P.L.O., J.D.L., they can all burn in Hell
Are you burning?Embed
