Oh, yeah

My dad's a builder, his friend's a plumber
They're getting cancer, and you can get stuffed
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
He works like a nigger for a moderate figure
We're not underprivileged, and you can get stuffed
Yeah, yeah, yeah, get stuffed

If you're creative
Well, you can get stuffed
If you're creative
Well, you can get – ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

If you paint like Picasso, unlearn it
If you've written Ulysses, burn it
If you're Flaubert, why trouble?
I do my best work with a shovel
And you can get stuffed
And you can get stuffed
Well, oh, get stuffed

They dig in the soil, their work involves toil
Sweat on their foreheads and you can get stuffed
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
My dad's better than your dad, I'm better than you
Your dad's in advertising and you'll be a gigolo too
You'll be a gigolo too (Ooh)

If you're creative
Well, you can get stuffed (Well, oh, get stuffed)
If you're creative
Well, you can get – ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Take it down

If you're an ad man, artist, poet or actor
Student, tutor, writer, chiropractor
If you design clothing or make a living from posing
If you paint pictures, run a boutique for bitches
If you deal in antiques or anything chic
If your career involves feeling instead of hauling and kneeling
Here's the end of the matter, yeah, yeah
Here's the end of the matter, yeah, yeah
Here's the end of the matter
You can get stuffed1Embed
