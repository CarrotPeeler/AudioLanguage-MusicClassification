1 ContributorDaydream Dalliances LyricsIntro :
Jesse: I feel like this is some dream world we're in, you know?
Celine: Yeah, it's so weird. It's like our time together is just ours. It's our own creation. It must be like I'm in your dream and you're in mine or something
Jesse: And what's so cool is that this whole evening, all our time together, shouldn't officially be happening
Celine: Yeah, I know. Maybe that's why this feels so otherworldly. But then the morning comes and we turn into pumpkins, right?
:
Yeah
We are Kensa and Soupherb
Writers' Block, Latent Labrats
Romantic tales
This is our daydream dalliances
I. Kensa
Even the loneliest soul can overdose in jubilation
An arrow to the heart plunges me in rumination
I was spellbound by her fluent cadence
Illuminated with a luminous radiance
We walked in dreams together like we're astronauts in space
Lucid dreams gave us a pair of wings to play
So we zoomed into the sky and sat on top of the moonlight
Stared as the sunrise split the two skies
I was a whippersnapper, just your average student
While she dazzled on the top, glowing in the translucence
Brilliance of the mind, the desire for coalescence scintillates like a firefly's bioluminescence
Graced with the body language of a constellation
Every moment we embraced was a neutron star collision
Stargazing lightyears away when we were dust
I pray the stars gaze back once the light reaches us

I don't believe in destinies and petty meant-to-be's
Fantasies and memories, it's ecstasy like mescaline
A frenemy to spend with for eternity
The feminine premonition tends to bring the best in me
II. Soupherb
No idea how she remains ideal
Lullabies or humming tunes to rock our cradles
Speaks with conviction for our awareness
Living so she can reach out for the unfortunate
Don't mistake this for obsession
But a need is felt to watch her save this world and blossom
Her presence forces me to give an impression
Inspires me to work, be her inspiration
It's impossible
But feels like I'm winning to scream anything is possible
I'll be her champion, questing with her guiding me
She's my trusty lantern radiating like the sun's rays
Reason why my heart stays warm
Her principles has kept me alarmed
Helps us to keep ourselves safe from harm
So at the end of the day, she can sing me another song
A way to rest during the calm before storms

A frenemy to spend with for eternity
The feminine premonition tends to bring the best in meEmbed
