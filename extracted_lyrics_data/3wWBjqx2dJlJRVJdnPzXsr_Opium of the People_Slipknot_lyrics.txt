28 ContributorsOpium of the People Lyrics
Come on

Watch those idiosyncrasies
Watch all the idiots fall on me
Running out of ways to get outta the way
Take another shot just to stay the same
But I need some balance, back it off
Fill your lungs till it makes you cough
Tell me everything's gonna be all right
'Cause I don't think I'll make it through tonight

The only way
Is all the way
The only way
Is all the way
The only way (The only way)
Is all the way (Is all the way)
The only way (The only way)
Is all the way

Oh my god
It's Judgment Day, and I'm not prepared
Everybody out there's runnin' scared
So take a little bit off the top
I don't care, just make it stop
See Slipknot LiveGet tickets as low as $59You might also like
I won't give another soul to you (I will never)
I won't give another life to you

No, you have to stop, stop
Stop, stop

Do one thing and say something cryptic
But the styles always clash
One thing I know for sure
The hypothetical won't work anymore
One wrong move, and they will pound
My nails are tight inside my wrists
This sacrament is sacrilege and sentimental
Deity experimental, faith is accidental

I won't give another soul to you (I will never)
I won't give another life to you (I will never)
I won't give another thought to you (I will never)
I won't give any more of my hope to you

Quit it, what do you want?
Quit it, what do you want?4Embed
