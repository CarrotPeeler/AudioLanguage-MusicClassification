5 ContributorsThe Great Escape LyricsWord I bring
—From far up North!
Songs I sing
—From your nephew's court!
Convened Þing
—On the death of Harthacnut!
Proclaimed king
—And the Danes salute!
"End your exile! Your claim to the throne is strong!
Sweyn's your ally! Us Swedes will fight along!"
Norway awaits me
It's time to cross the North Sea
First I must break free
We could ask Constantine
I'm needed elsewhere!
"No way! My troops I cannot spare."
This seems quite unfair!
"Can't you hear? My answer is no!"
My Basileus, my emperor
I have honorably served this kingdom
Sand I have won, and furthermore
Blood of Saracens have flowed by my work of sword
You might also likeMy Basileus, my emperor
You have left me no choice but to escape
Taking my men out from the hall
We are breaking our way out after nightfall
"This is insane, we're trapped in the Sound!"
Row for all you're worth, despair to mirth!
"The chain will not break, there's no way around!"
Over shall we go, so hasten now
From stern to bow
Tilt the galley over
For no emperor nor chain will stand in my way!
Man the oars!
Out to sea!
Bid farewell and wave goodbye
Because, gentlemen
We are heading home!
Rising, a new day rising
New kingdoms await
New lands there to take
Your son's heading home
He's a viking, the last of the vikings
With chests full of gold
Great tales to be told
Your king's heading homeEmbed
