2 ContributorsI Had To Cry LyricsSome people just can't seem to cry
When their darling says goodbye
But you take me now
I just can't help it, I had to cry
Some people have a cold, cold heart
Makes no difference if they part
But you take me now
Since you left me I had to cry
Why can't I be like some people
The kind that don't feel any pain
Why can't I be like the kind that don't mind
And start all over again
Some people just find someone new
Don't spend their time just feeling blue
But you take me now
Since you left me I had to cryYou might also likeEmbed
