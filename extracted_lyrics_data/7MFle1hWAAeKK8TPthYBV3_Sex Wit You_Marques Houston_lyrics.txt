6 ContributorsSex Wit You Lyrics
Let me break it down and tell you what your sex is like
Yeah, I don't know what it is
I just feel like sex with you is like
Ha, it's like â€” damn, I don't even know what it's like
Well, uh, let me try to explain

(Sex with you is like)
When I wake up in the morning
Smell that good old breakfast mama used to make
(Sex with you is like)
The feeling that you get
When all your friends surprise you on your birthday
(Sex with you is like)
Like I made the last shot and everybody's screaming my name
(Sex with you is like)
It's like my pocket's full of dough
And I ain't worried 'bout a damn thing

When I think about your sex
Nothing better comes to mind
I wanna sex you all the damn time
Just thinking 'bout the sex
Has got me wanting you to come through
And do sex like we always do
You might also like
Sex with you is really the best with you
It makes life worth going through
Ain't nobody got a body like you
'Cause my sex with you meets my needs
Ain't gotta go looking in the streets it's you
Ain't nothing better than the way we do
Girl, I'm loving having sex with you

(Sex with you is like)
Winning an award after working so damn hard
(Sex with you is like)
When the man at the dealership hands over the keys to my new car
(Sex with you is like)
When a check comes in the mail after being broke for so long
(Sex with you is like)
It's like getting out the pen and shorty's there to take you home

When I think about your sex
Girl, nothing better comes to mind
I wanna sex you all the damn time (Sex, girl)
Thinkin' 'bout your sex has got me wanting you to come through
And do sex like we always do
Sex with you is really the best with you
(Sex, yeah, is the best with you, you, you, you, you)
It makes life worth going through (Oh yeah)
Ain't nobody got a body like you
(Ain't nobody got your body, girl)
'Cause my sex with you meets my needs (Meets my needs)
Ain't gotta go looking in the streets, it's you
(Ain't gotta go looking in the streets, oh-ho)
Ain't nothing better than the way we do
Girl, I'm loving having sex with you

It's all about the freaky things we do
And I know I know (I know)
You like it just as much as I do
Baby, I ain't never tried to hit and run
I'm just tryna make you the only one
I'll be sexing you on the regular
'Cause ain't nothing better than sex with you
Oh, oh-oh
Let me break it down and tell you what your sex is like (Woo)
Sex with you is like
It's like going to the strip club
And ain't gotta pay for none of that strip love
Sex with you is like
Like a closet full of Air Force, low white, my size
Sex with you is like
Like being the first nigga in the hood with a black droptop 645
Sex with you is really the best with you
(Sex with you, is the best with you)
It makes life worth going through
Ain't nobody got a body like you
(Ain't nobody got a body)
'Cause my sex with you meets my needs (Meets my needs, baby)
Ain't gotta go looking in the streets, it's you
(I can have sex with you all night long)
Ain't nothing better than the way we do
('Til six in the morn')
Girl, I'm loving having sex with you
(I love having sex with you)

Sex with you, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, oh yeah
Sex with you yeah yeah, yeah, oh yeah
Sex with you, yeah, yeah
(Girl, if I take my clothes off, you'll take your clothes off, too)
Sex with you, yeah, yeah (Woo)1Embed
