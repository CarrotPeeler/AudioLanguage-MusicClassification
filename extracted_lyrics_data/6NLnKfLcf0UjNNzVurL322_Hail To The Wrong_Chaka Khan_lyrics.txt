2 ContributorsHail To The Wrong Lyrics
I made our house a home
We built a little studio of green and gold
Your song so pure of heart
How was I to know?
Deception was really your art

Living with the madness
Of the truth
Living with the gladness
God blessed to you, oh
With a little angel
I love as my own
So I say hail
Hail to the wrong

I can't be mad at you
I'm the one who closed my eyes at things you do
Now my life is bright and new
As long as I live, I'll pray for the baby and you, oh, oh

Living with the madness
Of the truth
Living with the gladness
God blessed to you, oh
With a little angel
I love as my own
So I say hail
Hail to the wrong

I promised you I'd write this song
Thanks for the lesson
Since you were gone
What you did wrong
Became a blessing
You deceived, I believed
Never questioning
But the beauty that came from the wrong that you did
Only made me stronger
I'm so strong, ooh
 what you did to me

Living with the madness
Of the truth
Living with the gladness
God blessed to you, oh
With a little angel
I love as my own
So I say hail
Hail to the wrong
Living with the madness
Of the truth (You can't hurt me no more)
Living with the gladness
God blessed to you, oh
With a little angel
I love as my own (As my own)
So I say hail
Hail to the wrong (Hail to the wrong)

Hail to the wrong
God bless you, baby
Oh, you'll never
