1 ContributorWhite Trash Toodle-Oo LyricsHe was a bebopper
He came
Smacked her round a bit
She cut herself with kitchen knives
The police they came
Took those kids away
Away from the trailer park
NOw I can hear the neighbors say
As he went away
What a mess
What a mess
All those kids are poor white trash
Run away
And leave today
All you ever been is poor white trash
And then I had a job
And soon I had to quit
My boss he had a mouth that
Hung open a little bit
His tiny view of life
Depressed and swallowed me
I dreamed of something more
Deep down inside I felt this way
But I couldn't say
You might also likeWhat a mess
What a mess
All those kids are poor white trash
Run away
And leave today
All you ever been is poor white trash
What a mess
What a mess
All those kids are poor white trash
Run away
And leave today
All you ever been is poor white trash
All you ever been is poor white
All you ever been is poor white
All you ever been is poor white
