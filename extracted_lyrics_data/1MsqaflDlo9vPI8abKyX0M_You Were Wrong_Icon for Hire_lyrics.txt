6 ContributorsYou Were Wrong Lyrics
You were wrong all along, tried to break me make me strong
You were wrong all along, tried to break me make me strong
(Oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh, oh oh oh)

I thought we were one and the same
Us against them and their dumb little game
Well, I guess I got played
Head in the sand and my heart on stage
Mmm, missed it, oh so twisted
Going to my grave all up tight-fisted
Never mind, I'm gonna be fine
Too much on the line to sit and cry

Oh woah oh, like don't you think I know?
This is not the end of me, this is not the end of me
Oh woah oh, like don't think you I know?
This is not the end of me, this is not the end of me

You were wrong all along, tried to break me make me strong
You were wrong all along, tried to break me make me strong
You were wrong all along, tried to break me make me strong
Try to break me, try to break me
Make me
(Oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh, oh oh oh)
You might also like
I don't really know what to say
Tryna keep track but everything's changing
And ain't it strange?
You and me thought we'd be keeping the world in flames
But all we did was burn it all down
Burn it all down
Burn it all down

Oh woah oh, like don't you think I know?
This is not the end of me, this is not the end of me
Oh woah oh, like don't think you I know?
This is not the end of me, this is not the end of me

You were wrong all along, tried to break me make me strong
You were wrong all along, tried to break me make me strong
You were wrong all along, tried to break me make me strong
Try to break me, try to break me
Make me

I don't go down easy, I don't bow out quiet
I never lost a war unless I didn't fight it
I don't go down easy, I don't bow out quiet
I never lost a war unless I didn't fight it
Pick my brain, pick your poison
If I'm to blame, then I ain't the only one
If I'm on the offense, well, I'm not sorry
You haven't exactly given me reasons regarding
The way that you snap me in half, the way you stab me in the back
The way that you front to my face and keep putting me in place
But I ain't under your thumb, I ain't stuck in your shadow
I'm on top of the world up here, fighting my battles
And I shoot to kill
I play to win and, baby, I will

You were wrong all along, tried to break me make me strong
You were wrong all along, tried to break me make me strong
You were wrong all along, tried to break me make me strong
Try to break me, try to break me

I don't go down easy, I don't bow out quiet
I never lost a war unless I didn't fight it
I don't go down easy, I don't bow out quiet
I never lost a war unless I didn't fight it
Oh, ohEmbed
