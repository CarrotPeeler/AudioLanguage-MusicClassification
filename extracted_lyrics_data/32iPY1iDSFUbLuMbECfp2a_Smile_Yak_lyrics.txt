2 ContributorsSmile LyricsTongue-tied
I can't smile
But if you can't hide
Then you gotta smile
You know I never said that romance was dead now
Blank eyes
Come on baby make 'em smile
I seen 'em before
But I ain't seen 'em for a while
And I love it when you rip me into pieces
You can't smile
You're too long in the tooth
And all the young
Were all spoiled by the youth
Still I never said that romance was dead now
?
I just want you to smile
If you can't hide
Oh come on baby let's smile
You might also likeStill I never said that romance was dead now
Look how we run for cover
Look how we run for cover
Look how we run for cover
Look how we ran for cover
?
Your back against the wall
You're screaming ?
Well you know you love it when
You know you love it when ?Embed
