2 ContributorsLetters In Wartime LyricsThere’s a way over you don’t go
Count the days all silent, pinned and roped
Well there’s dynamite in that tunnel for the matchbox in your head
You know, curious canaries suffer no fools in their stead
We got lost at sea once night deceived
Bitter tried you bleed, a bear that’s treed
Where not everything comes forgettable
This is the time I’ve waited for you
Bordered a line I can’t ignore
Taken a life I’ve waited to come again
It’s the only way that I talk
And you’ve always know that it was
It’s the only way I can tell you
Like letters in wartime do
Been lost at sea for years deceived
Chased by sets of French Corvettes
Where not everything comes forgettableYou might also likeEmbed
