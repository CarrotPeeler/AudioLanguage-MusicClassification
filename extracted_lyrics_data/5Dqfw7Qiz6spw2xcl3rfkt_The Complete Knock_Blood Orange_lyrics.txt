8 ContributorsThe Complete Knock Lyrics
If all it means
We lost you down the stream
(Where are you?)
Underground, and wasting thirty-two
I just don't know
What the hell is wrong with you?
Take revenge on those who are doing wrong with your life
Wisely choose a victim driven to strife
I just don't know what the hell is wrong with you
With you
 (2x)
(So I lost the truth in my own mind
It's scheming, kills completely
All I wanted was the dream of being young inside
This light, I must belong to you)
If all it means
We lost you down the stream
(Where are you?)
Underground, and wasting thirty-two
I just don't know
What the hell is wrong with you?
Take revenge on those who are doing wrong with your life
Wisely choose a victim driven to strife
I just don't know what the hell is wrong with you
With youYou might also like2Embed
