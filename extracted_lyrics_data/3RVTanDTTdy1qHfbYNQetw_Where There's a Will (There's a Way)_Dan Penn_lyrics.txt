1 ContributorWhere There’s a Will (There’s a Way) Lyrics
You don't think you can squeeze me in
But I know you can
You can find a little place in your heart
For the better man
Don't worry 'bout your promise after all you've been through
It's a shame the way he's been treating you

But you you that I love you so much
I just lose my head
I can feel it every time we touch
Your love for him is dead
You've never been to Heaven if you don't try
To find the words to tell a devil goodbye

Where there's a will (There's a way)
Love will find a way
Move every mountain you can't climb
Love will find a way (Love will find a way)

Well, you know what you got to do
And you're on the brink
You'd leave him in a New York heartbeat
If you had the strength
There ain't nothing stronger in this whole wide world
I know love is gonna make you my girl (My girl)
You might also like
Where there's a will (There's a way)
Love will find a way (Love will find a way)
Move every mountain you can't climb
Love will find a way (Love will find a way)

If you feel it's the right time just get it on
You'll be better off the minute he's gone

Where there's a will (There's a way) yes
Love will find a way (Love will find a way)
To move every mountain you can't climb
Love will find a way (Love will find a way)
There's always a way (There's a way) oh
To get over the mountain (Love will find a way)
Got to, got to be a way to tell him (There's a way)
Go on and tell him goodbye (Love will find a way)
Where there's a will, there's a way (There's a way)

(There's a way)
(There's a way)
There's always a way (There's a way)
Always a wayEmbed
