All by herself
She didn't get
A lotta help
She made mistakes
Along the way
But here's one thing
I can truly say
My mama loved me
And she worked
And she slaved
From a little bitty baby
She made me what I am today
She didn't put up
With no back talk
I learned respect
Before I could walk
She let me run
But not all night
I'm so glad
She raised me up right
My mama love me
Ahhh...she worked and she slaved
From a little baby boy
She made me what I am today

Now boys and girls
Hear what I got to say
Be good to your mama
Each and every day
Friends may come
Friends may go
But you only got one mama
And I want you to know
My mama loved me
And she worked
And slaved
From a little baby
She made me who I am todayEmbed
