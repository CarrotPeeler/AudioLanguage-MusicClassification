9 ContributorsGranite Lyrics
You can hide your eyes, you can dim the lights, but they are watching
This is a new time with a different kind, they are the future
The only one
It's a final call for the setting sun when they get closer
And with a fall from grace thy will be done, the show is over
It's a new dawn
Just leave this place behind
I'll clear your bloodshot mind
They only wanted your life on demand
This is a better way

They were standing by, no time to hide, no meeting halfway
You were sucking life through the needle's eye, this is a new day
And they have won
We will surrender now or be outdone, left in the open
It's the cooling of the horizon, they are the future
The future
When all your fears combined
The manifest was refined
I know you really tried to understand
This is a new way
(It's a new dawn)
(It's a new dawn)
(It's the only one, the only one)See Pendulum LiveGet tickets as low as $65You might also like2Embed
