Rhythm of the music and my body starts to sway
You can feel when the music starts to groove
Rhythm of the music and my body starts to move
Exterminate


Can you feel when the music starts to play?
Rhythm of the music and my body starts to sway
You can feel when the music starts to groove
Rhythm of the music and my body starts to move
