6 ContributorsWayfarer LyricsIt's a gamble, double down or don't
Step out if you want to, stay in if you're bold, and roll
Could be a sure shot, or just as well, a fold
Guessing's never easy and wishes never sold like gold
The wheels are turning, the world keeps burning and all fall
To sweet defeat, so complete
Oh, call it humbling or brand it stumbling
Don't stop living and don't stop sailing to meet what will be destiny
We are wayfarers
With a wish to stay alive
For a cause, for a dream
There's much to move in a moving sea
Could be a sure shot, or just as well, a fold
Guessing's never easy and wishes never sold like gold
How about a handle or something set to hold?
Love is everlasting when love is on the road, I'm told
We are wayfarers
With a wish to stay alive
For a cause, for a dream
There's much to move in a moving seaSee Hot Water Music LiveGet tickets as low as $115You might also likeEmbed
