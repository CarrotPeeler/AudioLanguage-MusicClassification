Eloise, hang on in there
Other girls are trying to get me
But it's you I love
Now I can love you if you'll only let me
It's you I'll take in the park
Don't give up
Don't give up
Eloise, hang on in there
Eloise, hang on in there
Now if you want your man
You got to put up a fight
If you want to keep him happy
You got to treat him right
And, don't give up
Don't give up
Eloise, hang on in there
Eloise, hang on in there
You're the only girl in life for me
Just for you alone I waited patiently
If you give up I wouldn't know what to do
Eloise, my darling I'm counting on you
You might also likeDon't give up
Don't give up
Eloise, hang on in there
Eloise, hang on in thereEmbed
