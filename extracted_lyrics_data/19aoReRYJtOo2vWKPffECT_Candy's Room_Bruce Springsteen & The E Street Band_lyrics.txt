13 ContributorsCandyâ€™s Room Lyrics
In Candy's room
There are pictures of her heroes on the wall
But to get to Candy's room
You gotta walk the darkness of Candy's hall
Strangers from the city
Call my baby's number and they bring her toys
When I come knocking, she smiles pretty
She knows I wanna be Candy's boy

There's a sadness hidden in that pretty face
A sadness all her own from which no man can keep Candy safe
We kiss, my heart rushes through my brain
And the blood rushes in my veins
The fire rushes towards the sky
And we go driving, driving deep into the night
I go driving deep into the light in Candy's eyes

She says, "Baby, if you wanna be wild
You got a lot to learn
Close your eyes, let them melt, let them fire
Let them burn

'Cause in the darkness
There'll be hidden worlds that shine"
When I hold Candy close
She makes those hidden worlds mine


She has fancy clothes and diamond rings
She has men who give her anything
She wants, but they don't see
That what she wants is me

Oh, and I want her so
I'll never let her go, no no no
She knows that I'd give all that I've got to give
All that I want, all that I live
To make Candy mine tonight2Embed
