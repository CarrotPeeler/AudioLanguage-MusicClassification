1 ContributorDid You No Wrong LyricsShe said, "I want you baby", and stared in my eye
She said, "I need you, honey and that's no lie"
I believe all that you said
It never crossed my mind there'd be heartbreak ahead
I did you no wrong
Why'd you hurt me, baby?
I did you no wrong
Why desert me, baby?
She gave me her key and let me come deep inside
She held me real tight, she said, "you got nothing to hide"
I gave her my love but I never got the same
I gave her sweetness while she just caused me pain
I did you no wrong
Why'd you hurt me, baby?
I did you no wrong
Why desert me, baby?
Found myself walking and I got no place to go
All the things I did, I got nothing to show, yeah
Love can do tricks, make you too blind to see
Tie you up and twist you around when you oughta be free
She seemed to need me, so I gave her my heart
But when she took it, man, she tore it apart, yeah
You might also likeI did you no wrong
Why'd you hurt me, baby?
I did you no wrong
Why desert me, baby?
Come on, baby
Talkin' about my baby
Talkin' about my baby
Oh yeah, my baby
Talkin' about my baby
I did you no wrong
So why'd you hurt me, baby?
I did you no wrong, honey
Why'd you hurt me, baby?
I love you so much, honey
Why'd you hurt me, baby?
Oh, not now, baby
Why'd you hurt me, baby?
Oh, love to love you late at night
I said now, baby, baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby, baby
Baby, I love youEmbed
