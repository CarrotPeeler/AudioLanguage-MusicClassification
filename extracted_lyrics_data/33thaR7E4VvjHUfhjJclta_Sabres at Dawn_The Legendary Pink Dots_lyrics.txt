1 ContributorSabres At Dawn LyricsMonsters are stalking
With liquid depravity...
Seeping through cracks
They are flashing their cavities...
Spitting out crumbs
As they numb me with pungent profanity...
Sing to me
Sing of your cauldron of woe
So explicit...
You lick, then you blow
See a target...
So was it my body?
Or is it my mind?
A cackling crow
At a wake for a dead friend...
A loose end
A U-bend
A space to be filled
For the silence is damning
And here in my seat...
With my fingertips dancing
I'm trying to sleep...
You might also likeThrough the bleeping
The bleating of suffering sheep...
Tap a key
Tell the world that the world loves a Cola
A key
Play a tune in a Singapore street...
And they pile into bus stops
Swerve into ravines
Call a doctor, I've split at the seams...
At the seams...
At the seams...
Call a doctor, I've split at the seams...
At the seams...
Do it now!Embed
