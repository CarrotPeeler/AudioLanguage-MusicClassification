4 ContributorsYour Light LyricsWhen you're feeling lost and blue
When there is no love for you
You'll find him and it's all right
It's all right
It's all right
When you're feeling down and low
When you've got no place to go
And when no one smiles hello
He's by your side, you know
When you're getting deaf and blind
When you drag one leg behind
And when you're finally gonna lose your mind
It's all right
It's all right
It's all right
'Cause he is by your side
'Cause he will be your guide
'Cause he will be your light
And you're not alone
You're not alone
You're not alone
You're not aloneSee Scorpions LiveGet tickets as low as $61You might also like1Embed
