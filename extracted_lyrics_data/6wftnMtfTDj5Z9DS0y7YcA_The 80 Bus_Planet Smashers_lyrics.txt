1 ContributorThe 80 Bus LyricsOn my way from work, I'm on the 80 bus
It's crowded as hell, someone's raising up a fuss
Shove past an old man and take the last free spot
I lean back in my bucket seat and check out what I've got
Sparkle in my eye, smile on my face
Slicked back hair, gotta keep up with the pace
Cheap smelling perfume is drifting here and there
I open up a window 'cause it's really hard to bear
All I need is a look in my direction
Take another peek at a wonderful complection
All this stress makes me suffer indigestion
Hey, won't you notice, spend a moment in reflection
You'll always find me hanging around
Playing pool at Gert's and drinking 'till I drown
A leisure suit, I can't get dusty
Karaoke mic, you know my singing's rusty
Friday night is here, and I'm on the move
Fall down some stairs, and roll me up a dube
Rev up the engine of my shiny Trans-am
I guess I never realized that I'm my only fan
You'll always find me hanging around
Playing pool at Gert's and drinking 'till I drown
A leisure suit, I can't get dusty
Karaoke mic, you know my singing's rustyYou might also likeEmbed
