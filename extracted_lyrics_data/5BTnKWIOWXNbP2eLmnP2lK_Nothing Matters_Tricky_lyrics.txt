4 ContributorsNothing Matters Lyrics
It bothers me, it bites me, singes me, deprives me
Off my check, the ways you make me pass, by highways
I am forced to trust your wicked ways
You use me, abuse me, control me

When nothing really matters
When nothing really matters
This broken heart's a shatter
As long as you love me
But something needs to matter
When love deceives it batters
These gunshots are a shatter
So you must love me

In my mind I have killed you long ago
Born pretender, spirit's high jacker
You killed my love for you
Innocent blood, excuse me now
Mr. Right knight, tell me
Stuck in a days
Can't even understand no more

When nothing really matters
When nothing really matters
These broken hearts are shattered
As long as you love me
But something needs to matter
When love deceives it batters
These gunshots are a shatter
So you must love me
You might also like
Born pretender, spirit high jacker
In the name of the Lord
You, heart snatcher, backbiter
Yes they are partakers of sucking innocent blood
Nights walking vampires, excuse me now
Introduce me to your industry
'Cause with me you will definitely go very far
Stuck in a daze, can't even understand unknowingly
Approaching the world through a vivid glance
But it concerns me, and it concern us, yet it condemns us
For this is the fact, the truth and it will forever hunt us but

Nothing really matter
Nothing really matters
These broken hearts are shattered
As long as you love me
But something needs to matter
When love deceives it batters
These gunshots are a shatter
So you must love meEmbed
