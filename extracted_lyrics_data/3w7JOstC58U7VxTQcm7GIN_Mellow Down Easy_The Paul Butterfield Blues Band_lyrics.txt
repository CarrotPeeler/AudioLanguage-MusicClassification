Jump, jump, here
Jump, jump, there
Jump, jump, baby
Everywhere

You gotta mellow down easy, baby
You gotta mellow down easy, baby
You gotta mellow down easy, baby 'fore you blow your top
You gotta mellow down easy, baby, please don't stop

You gotta move, move here
You gotta move, move there
Move, move, baby
Move, move, baby
Move, move, baby
Everywhere

You gotta mellow down easy, baby
You gotta mellow down easy, baby
You gotta mellow down easy, baby 'fore you blow your top
You gotta mellow down easy, baby 'fore you blow your top

Move, move, here
Move, move, there
Move, move, baby
Everywhere

You gotta mellow down easy, baby
You gotta mellow down easy, baby
You gotta mellow down easy, baby
You gotta mellow down easy, babyEmbed
