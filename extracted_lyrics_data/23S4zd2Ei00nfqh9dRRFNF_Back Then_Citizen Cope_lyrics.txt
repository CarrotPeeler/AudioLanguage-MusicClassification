1 ContributorBack Then LyricsBefore the laws and the social orders
Before the calls of the lieutenant's order
Before the rise of pop culture
Before the guards at the borders
Before the expectations
Led to life's frustrations
Before the path to salvation was clouded
By the deep depths of temptation
Back then
It was alright to pretend
But all we really have is within
And we disguised expected
Back then
Love had a place to stay
It wasn't getting turned away
It took my whole life just to realize
This has to make a way to back then
Back then
Back then
Back then
Well holy sons, holy daughters, holy sisters, holy brothers
Holy skies, holy waters
For those who came before us
But on the way to work come before us
You might also likeBefore the expectations
Led to life's frustrations
Before the path to salvation was clouded
By the deep depths of temptation
Back then
It was alright to pretend
But all we really have is within
And we disguised expected
Back then
Love had a place to stay
It wasn't getting turned away
It took my whole life just to realize
This has to make a way to back then
Back then
Back then
Back then
Back then
Back thenEmbed
