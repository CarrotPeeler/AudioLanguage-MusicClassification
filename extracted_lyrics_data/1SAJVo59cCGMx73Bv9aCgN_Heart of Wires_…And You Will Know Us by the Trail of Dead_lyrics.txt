2 ContributorsHeart of Wires LyricsOut from the wires under the ambience
Born form the violence haunting the town
Indigo stains, eyes that answer
To one with no one around
Here on the many cold day
She walks among this heart of wires
Steal her memories back form the boy
Whose mind has come alive
Blood becomes oil melts into acid
Thoughts become blurs on the monitor lights
Who is to say that life is not spung up
From silence that dwells in dusguise
Here amidst the cold razors
She walks among this heart of wires
Give her memories back to the by
Whose mind comes afire
I will come back here
I will come after you
I will come back here
I will come back here
I will come after you
I will come back here
You might also likeWho from the heart of these wires
Rises up from the mud
Into their graves, I'll bury the stones
Make silent their innocent tongues
Here amidst the cold razors
She walks among these heart of wires
Seize the beast and the boy
And bring them back to me alive
Here on her bellicose days
She stalks among these heart of wires
Steal her memories back from the boy
Whose mind has come alive
I will come back here
I will come after you
I will come back hereEmbed
