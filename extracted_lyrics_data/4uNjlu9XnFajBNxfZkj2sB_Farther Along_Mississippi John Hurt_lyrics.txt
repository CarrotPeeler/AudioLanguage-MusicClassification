Farther along we will know all about it
Farther along we will understand why
Cheer up, my brother, live in the sunshine
We'll understand it all by and by

'Faithful till death' said our loving Master;
A few more days to labor and wait
Toils of the road will then seem like nothing
As we squeeze through that beautiful gate

Farther along we will know all about it
Farther along we will understand why
Cheer up, my brother, lives in the sunshine
We'll understand it all by and by

When we see Jesus, comin' in glory
When he come from his home in the sky
Then we shall meet him in that bright manger
We'll understand it all by and by

Farther along we will know all about it
Farther along we will understand why
Cheer up, my brother, lives in the sunshine
We'll understand it all by and byYou might also likeEmbed
