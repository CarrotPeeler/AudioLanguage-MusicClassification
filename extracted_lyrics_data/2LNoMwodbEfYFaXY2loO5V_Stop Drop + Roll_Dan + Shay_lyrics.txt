6 ContributorsStop, Drop And Roll Lyrics
There's a two lane getaway red hot summer day
Jump into my '65 Mustang, ain't she a pretty thing?
Just like you, and it's burnin' me up, burnin' me up, burnin' me up
Yeah, tell me what I wanna hear
You're turnin' me on, turnin' me on, turnin' me on
Yeah baby let's get outta here

Do you wanna wanna, do you wanna wanna go?
Pedal on the floorboard
Lay a little bit of rubber down this road
Bass bumpin' on the car door
Got a blue sky, got a fast ride
Got all the time in the world so come on little girl
Whoa, all we gotta do is stop, let the top drop and roll

We can leave town right now, take it down the interstate
Just get gone
Oh baby we could just get lost while the radio plays our favorite song
Well turnin' it up, turnin' it up, turnin' it up
That's just what I wanna hear
Burnin' me, up burnin' me up, burnin' me up
Yeah baby let's get out of here
You might also like
Do you wanna wanna, do you wanna wanna go?
Pedal on the floorboard
Lay a little bit of rubber down this road
Bass bumpin' on the car door
Got a blue sky, got a fast ride
Got all the time in the world so come on little girl
Whoa, all we gotta do is stop, let the top drop and roll

Yeah, roll down the windows
Let your hair blow
Let your hair blow
Yeah, roll down the windows
Let your hair blow
Let it all blow
Let it all blow
We can leave town right now
Take it down the interstate

Do you wanna wanna, do you wanna wanna go?
Pedal on the floorboard
Lay a little bit of rubber down this road
Bass bumpin' on the car door
Got a blue sky, got a fast ride
Got all the time in the world so come on little girl
Whoa, all we gotta do is stop, let the top drop and roll
Yeah, roll down the windows
Let your hair blow
Let it all blow
Let it all blowEmbed
