5 ContributorsI Love Work Lyrics
Woke up this morning a little too early
A little too tired, a little too surly
Guess I got up on the wrong side of the bed
When I shoulda stayed in it instead
But I gotta go to work 'cause I love it
Oh, how I wanna tell the boss to shove it
No matter how I want to crash
Need abundance of funds when it comes to cash
So I wash my face with a little bit of water
To wake me up ("Does it work?" "Yeah, sorta")
Inspect the reflection, check my eyes
They're bloodshot, that's no surprise
So I wake up every day the same way
No matter what time I hit the hay
Fall asleep at like seven o'clock
And I wake up tired, wearing dirty socks, thinking

I love (I love work)
Work (I love work)
I love (Geez, I love work)
Work

Put my shoes on, strap them up
Put on my shorts, scratch my nut
Put on my shirt, get something to eat
And then I'm out the door and I'm into the street
Driving my car, still puttin' my clothes on
When I realise I left the stove on
I'm gonna be late if I have to go home
But I got no choice so I'll bust a U-bone
At the buisiest intersection
Probably starting to wish that I'd slept in
'Cause now a cop is pullin' me over
And I'm quite sure that I'm not quite sober
But he's happy just giving me a ticket
When he pisses off, I'm gonna flick it
Out the window and go to work wired
Hope I don't get fired for being so tired
A quarter to is when I'm supposed to start
But I'm looking at my watch and it's quarter past
Boss is telling me to get off my arse
But it's against my religion to be working fast
So I said another company has made some offers
If you want me to stay, "I need a new office!"
He's fuming and foaming at the mouth
When he reminded of the stove at my house
Never went back to turn it off
Because I got sidetracked, interacting with the cop
I'm telling my boss how a fire might burn
My house and my stuff and the money that I've earned
Thought it was a lie, wouldn't let me go home
So I quit my job to save everything I own
Bust him in the eye and called him a jerk
When it got me to thinking, I love work
You might also like
I love (I love work)
Work (I love work)
I love (Geez, I love work)
Work

Speeding home, I got pulled over again
By the same cop saying, "Well if it isn't my old friend!"
Looked him in the eye, told him the truth
So he came to my house to check the proof
And there's the roof, fully ablaze
I guess I'm just havin' one of those days
I lost my job, my house burned down
And I got two tickets from the same clown
All my memories are up in smoke
All my enemies are fuckin' stoked
'Cause now I've got nothin' left
And I can't even collect a counter check
Because for that, you need ID
And the Centrelink staff don't recognise me
Still have a hangover, my head hurts
But none of this would have happened if I didn't go to work

Now I wake up in the afternoon
Hardly ever even leave my room
Unless I need to shit or piss
Or eat something, 'cause I don't wanna miss
Jerry Springer, Ricki Lake
I don't wanna clean the mess that I make
I'm allowed and proud to be a slob
It's all part of the parcel of my new job
I can wake up with serious bed hair
I don't brush it, it just sits there
The main concern is I get enough sleep
And I hand my form in every couple of weeks
'Cause the government pays for me to stay home
And I much prefer to be on my own
I got tired of bein' a clerk
But now, I love work
I love (I love work)
Work (I love work)
I love (Geez, I love work)
