2 ContributorsGlad Iâ€™m Not God! LyricsI was about to lose my girlfriend
Had to make a clever move
Entered into a meditation
Inhaled all the incense fumes
But when I got all stoned and kinky
Chanting mantras about love
They made me sign away my property
Now it's owned by heaven above
Guru Guru
Don't you tell all you're god's anchor
Guru Guru
You'd sink the boat, you're such a wanker
He wants to come inside your temple
Spill his seeds of ecstasy
He wants to penetrate your aura
The horny man of mystery
He's gonna pluck your lotus flower
Be at one with your cosmic love
And make you dance the kama sutra
