4 ContributorsKeep On Runninâ€™ LyricsYou make me believe in magic
I never felt this way before
My heart is wide open baby
Just come back - don't hurt me no more
Don't you worry - I know the answer
Let me be the one to hold you - darling
Always want to - be around you
Don't you know my love is true
I keep on running - to you baby
Keep on running on the way to your heart
Let me show you that I need you
I know nothing's gonna tear us apart
Keep on running to you baby
Cause together we can make it start
Let me show you that I need you
I know nothing's gonna tear us apart
Keep on running - oho - keep on running
You've been away for so long
I was a fool for letting you go
You showed me what love was made for
I never knew I needed you so
I will always - be on your side
I like everything you doYou might also likeEmbed
