1 ContributorGeneration Plastic LyricsIt's you over my dream frame
Falling from hi-grace like myself
It's you a blue star to stare us
Breathing togheter
In cold sides of my mind
I'm starting to rewind
Over the golden heart that is colder
You're fading by my side
Oh i can't stop to cry
Losing my only hope in this dark dead world of rust
It's you over my dream frame
Falling from hi grace like myself
It's you a blue star to stare us
Breathing togheter in the dark
It's you living for nothing
Living in nowhere for my faults
It's you enjoing this decay dance
Over the dance floor of my heart
In cold sides of my mind
I'm starting to rewind
Over the golden heart that is colder
You're fading by my side
Oh i can't stop to cry
Losing my only hope in this dark dead world of rustYou might also likeEmbed
