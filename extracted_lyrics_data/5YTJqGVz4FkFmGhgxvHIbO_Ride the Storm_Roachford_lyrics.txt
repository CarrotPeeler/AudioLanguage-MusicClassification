It's time to stop thinking about what you ain't got
And see the things you have
Now don't you go and throw it all throw it all away
Tomorrow doesn't have to be just another yesterday
Ride the storm, life goes on, life goes on, ride the storm
'Cause I can't watch you drown away, drown in your own tears
Everybody gets hurt sometimes and everybody has fears
You say you want to end it all, but don't you get that rad baby
'Cause if you want the good things, you got to taste the bad sometimes
That's how it is
Ride the storm, life goes on, life goes on, ride the storm
'Cos I know that life can get hazy
But don't let this world drive you crazy, hear me baby...
So don't let your world turn a permanent shade of blue
You've got to learn to kick the habit baby
Before it starts to kick you yes it will
Don't you know you're bold enough and strong enough to fight
Someway somehow you know it's going to be all right, that's how it is
Ride the storm, life goes on, life goes on, ride the stormYou might also likeEmbed
