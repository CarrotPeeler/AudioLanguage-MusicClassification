1 ContributorOut Of Favors Lyrics( Intro )
Yea
Uh huh yea
Woah wo- woah
Yea kill em
( Verse 1 )
Bout to get head let me push back my seat
Real mafucker ion need no receipt
I swear fo god if you look down on me
That'll be the end last time it'll be
Better no your lane better know your lil place
Or end up on your ass or on your lil face
I'll smash any bitch don't matter the race
If she wanna try ima give her a lil taste
I'm Xing out anything everything that's not bout stacking checks don't ask me why
Motherfuckers keep trying me
Sooner I'ma sell what they trying they gon hate what they buy
I'm reading expressions don't care bout no words
Be up in the hood and in the suburbs
Got what you need I got that good herb
I'm leaning from the jack ion do dat lil syrup
Gotta a lil freaky lil thang but she talk to much cuz she keep asking bout closure
Yeah I played ball but the field that I'm in now got me labeled as a solider
These nighas salty they name kosher
Don't let the drug that you own get you food sir
Mafuckers telling me that I'm next and I see my time getting closer
Ion really shake no hands to make no friends only shake to make some deals that's foreal
Gotta go harder than the hardest it time for me to go ill
Fuck making wages man I need dem mils
Leave out the house can't forget my steel
Pressure you feel if you touching shit that you shouldn't like the button that'll make me kill ya
Fucks ion got none left and then favors ion got none either
Say she a virgin but I don't believe her
These bitches dirty don't let them deceive ya
Getting to the bread willingly I'm eager
See no point in doing it if don't feed ya
Get in her guts and go deeper
Then I get in my car and I leave her
I'm above the average above the law never speak on what I seen or saw
Can't say the same for these nighas it be the same ones that's big and bad that tell when they fall
Just don't want some money I want it all
And for the grind I'm giving it all it takes
Baby on your pussy I'm straight
And ion really hang with these nighas cuz they fake
The ones in my circle only ones that get a plate yeah
Moving but I like to keep it hiding
It's why's for what I do and I make wise decisions
Beefing over money nighas got to be kidding
Became a lil older to find adults are big children
Just because I'm chill don't mean I do the chilling
Better hide your girl when I step in
Thief in the night blacked out I'm blended in
Ion ever look down on no body ion ever look down at all
Gotta whole contact list that's filled with numbers don't pick up once that say it all
I glad being needed is not how I was made
Fuck bi weekly everyday I need to get paid
Burning that weed not sage
Off the red cup shawty finna get slayed hey
Back to my business I'm back in my motion my life need all my attention
Keeping that thing on me with a 12 round mag other mag I got is extensions
Oops I mean extended
And your time with me has ended
I'm not the type to take back what I said if I said it that mean I meant it
All about action
Keeping my traction
Never be lacking
And a nigha like me never slacking
For shit I'm never asking getting on my own I'm la make it happen
Nighas these guns ill get clapping
If her ass clapping I am smacking it
Yeah I'm smacking
This food I'm smacking
I be taxing
Like a blunt in my hand I'm passing her
I don't do no rations and the spot you at I'm passing
Right I I'm just loading up but believe I am not laggingYou might also likeEmbed
