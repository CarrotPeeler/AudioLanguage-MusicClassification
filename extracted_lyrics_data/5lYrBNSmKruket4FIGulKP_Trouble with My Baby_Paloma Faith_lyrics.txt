6 ContributorsTrouble with My Baby Lyrics
Well, you ask for money
It's always something
We're getting close to goodbye
You're running out of time
I need someone to rely on
A shoulder to cry on
Instead of someone on mine
Gotta draw the line, baby, baby

You changed and I need a little loving (Little loving)
I can't keep giving you all but get back nothing

When will somebody save me? (Somebody save me)
I got trouble with my baby (Trouble with my baby)
Come on, come on, won't you shake me ?
(Please, somebody shake me)
Please, somebody wake me
(Please, somebody wake me)
'Cause I know (I know)
I do (I do) too much (Too much) for you
I got trouble with my baby (Trouble with my baby)
Got trouble with my baby (Trouble, trouble with my baby)
You might also like
You got problems with emotion
Don't know if you're coming or going
There's emptiness in your eyes
Your tongue's always tied
Had enough of being a hero
One day I'm gonna give you zero
And you'll have no place to hide
In this heart of mine, baby, baby

You changed and I need a little loving (Little loving)
I can't keep giving you all and get back nothing

When will somebody save me? (Somebody save me)
I got trouble with my baby (Trouble with my baby)
Come on, come on, won't you shake me?
(Please, somebody shake me)
Please, somebody wake me
(Please, somebody wake me)
'Cause I know (I know)
I do (I do) too much (Too much) for you
I got trouble with my baby (Trouble with my baby)
Got trouble with my baby (Trouble, trouble with my baby)
I can't go on like this
You got me so damn pissed
Your talking makes me sick
Mamma said there'll be days like this
Now the whole world knows...

...I got trouble with my baby (Somebody save me)
Got trouble with my baby (Trouble with my baby)
Come on, come on, won't you shake me?
(Please, somebody shake me)
Please, somebody wake me
(Please, somebody wake me)
'Cause I know (I know)
I do (I do) too much (Too much) for you
I got trouble with my baby (Trouble with my baby)
Yes, I have (Trouble, trouble with my baby)
Won't somebody help me? (Trouble with my baby)
I got trouble with my baby (Trouble, trouble with my baby)
Got trouble with my baby (Trouble with my baby)
Got trouble with my baby (Trouble, trouble with my baby)
