8 ContributorsIt Beâ€™s That Way Sometime Lyrics
When your guy has got his hat
And made himself hard to find
It doesn't mean you should go crazy
If it be's that way sometime
Find yourself another love
Who will treat you good and kind
Return the love he gives to you
It also be's that way sometime

Baby, yes, it does
Baby, yes, it does
Baby, yes, it does
Baby, yes, it does
Baby

When you think you've found a love
And you have peace of mind
Somebody else steals his heart
Yes, it also be's that way sometime

Baby, yes, it does
Baby, yes, it does
Baby, yes, it does now
Baby, yes, it does
Baby
You might also like
Don't let the problems of this world
Drive you slowly outta your mind
Just smile, look at the problem and say
"It be's that way, be's that way sometime"

Baby, yes, it does
Baby, yes, it does
Baby, yes, it does now
Baby, yes, it does
Baby, oh
It also be's that way sometime
It also be's that way
It also be's that way
Be's that way sometime
Ho, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoaEmbed
