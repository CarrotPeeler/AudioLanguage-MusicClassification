3 ContributorsThe Honour of Silence LyricsHe stood like Jesus
He smelt like heaven
His eyes were winter
Our story is
The march of the lonely
The march of the lonely
The march of the lonely
Come to me
In my darkness
My dark hero
My tall stranger
Tears of sweat
Cry from your body
The strength and the cruelty
In your gentle nature
We honour the silence, between
Ourselves
Between ourselves
We honour the silence, between
Ourselves
Between ourselvesYou might also likeEmbed
