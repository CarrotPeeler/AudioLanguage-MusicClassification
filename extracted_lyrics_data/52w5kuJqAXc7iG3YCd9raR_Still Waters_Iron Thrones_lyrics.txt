1 ContributorStill Waters LyricsWe all scratch at the walls
Trying to get some kind of grip
In hopes of finding our way out of the fog
And have our eyes be graced by the vivid brightness
The beauty that lies outside the boundaries
This docile valley struggles to breathe
Void of reality
And complexed by depression
The water still rises just as a string section
This music for the first time has hit my ears
This never changing life
I must erase
Detеrmination gleaming in my eyes likе tears
I believe this is the first time I've seen my real face
Please believe
Let your true colors be your guide
For you are the only resident of your mind
Together lets escape these still waters
Let this current flow no more
Turn out it's light and shut the doorYou might also likeEmbed
