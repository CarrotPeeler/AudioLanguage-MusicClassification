5 ContributorsULTIM4TE Lyrics
Big things come in small packages
I'm the only one they don't want static with
Beam on his head, then I'm skull-bashing it
Say my name, better have a bolt after it
Pulling up in a Lightning McQueen
Killua - got the godliest speed
Underestimate, you might be deceived
Overpowered, so my height is redeemed
Now that boy shocked, no Kaminari
I don't do sorry, take a Chidori
Ain't enough drip on you, how can you harm me?
Pikachu ain't even striking me offbeat
I'm on the map, you know my name
Gotta unlock me, I be lowkey
I'm at the top, homiе, don't hate
You getting thunderclappеd, yolo, ain't no coming back
Oh god, I mean, oh Zeus
I turn my enemies into old news
Smoking on opp pack, shit, I'm so rude
Boy, this is my map, get your own room
Don't try to climb back, I'mma go boom!
You won't get saved by the bell, I'm Zatch
Why you want smoke if you ain't gon' match?
Zendaya Coleman - you finna get Zapped!
You might also like
Young, but I'm far from the weakest Link
Try hard if you must, but you can't compete
Triforce with a Blade makes me complete
Short guy, but I fly, never reached my peak
I'm dropping bombs like I'm flex on the radio
I got it locked like the keys to the safe, but don't
Think that you're safe, I'm in key when I play these notes
I'm taking bets, I won't wind any place that I go
No, I am the GOAT
I am the symbol of hope
I am the one that they call when they're feeling alone
And they feel like there's nowhere to go
I am the fighter
I am the flame in the darkness
I am the spark on the flint like a flick from a lighter
I am ignited, I am the light on my torch when I light it
Look, I changed the game, now they call me the greatest
They say my name 'cause they know I can save them
They want the fame, I don't need to be famous
But I'll keep you safe, there's no need to be anxious
I keep a blade, just in case, and I'll pull it
Open the gates to the cave, and I go in
Won't be the same if I'm gone, and you know it
They see the kid, and they know that I'm chosen
I'm the ultimate component
I've been around for awhile, got some moves, I'm 'bout to go in
I'll be warping to the floor, ain't a chance you're gonna stop me
See, this cannon's gonna blast you, I'm an upgrade, not a copy
No, I don't miss
Try your hardest, but I promise you, you won't hit
Electric shock is gonna spark you, just gonna charge, now you're screwed
Hope you know you're doomed, you can run, but there's no hiding, not unless you're bombproof
But I got multiple talents, I'm boutta show you
You bit off more than you could chew with this sexy ET
From another galaxy, I'm dashing through the competition
You're gonna need a physician, missiles be hittin' with mad precision
Yeah, so before you decide you can take me on
Just use your brain for a second, I promise, you're thinking wrong
With shoulders broader than your future and a power they all lust for
A Dark Samus keeps on mopping up the floor

Step up to the roster, doing numbers like a countdown
Hot up on the spot, just making records and the ground pound
What? You tryna beat it? Face the dust, I'll make you eat it
Watch me do it like I do, huh, honey, you know what to do
Call me Daisy, baby, bitches wanna chase me
Way they see me moving got 'em thinking that it's HD
Tell me I'm an echo, but my memory is hazy
Do it like a boss, but baby's looking like a lady
Stacking it back to back, smack opps like camel packs, better back it up
Watch me whacking, bashing, smacking, steady snapping, get your status up
Bitches mad, catch this bag, pressed 'cause they ain't bad enough
Stacking dubs, blasting up, hah, as I'm blasting ya
Wanna take a swing at it? Brody, better batter up
Hit it, make it sing, better princess bring the badder punch
Crowd jumping, bumping, filling stands at the matches, huh
Send you right down, got you munching where his stache is, yuh
A two for one, if you want me, she's coming with
And we never slip because of the grips on our kicks
With a couple twists, hold 'em, I don't think they get the gist
We describe it as just vibing, I don't mind it, tell 'em, sis
OK, we storm in like the weather, you don't want us two together
Is it me, or is it easy? Name a team that does it better
Not aggressive more or less, or independent whatsoever
If we're only using melee, then we'll keep you here forever
'K, look, I'm tired of playing nice
Cool it, yo, you're cold as ice
Wait 'till I get 'em off the side
That's when I get 'em with a spike
I don't think they've realized
This is only half a fight
When we're combined, then we're climbing
And we're not afraid of heights
And you can meet us at the top
If they wonder where we've been
Then we might just kick you off
But we'll say that it's the wind
Just by coating them in frost
From the moment we begin
Yeah, we'd hardly call it fair
But a win is a win, uh

I've been tryna tell them from the get go, Chrom would be in Smash Bros
Thought I lost my chance last match, had to come back like an echo
Let's go! For generations all my fam has been dope
Now, I'm the Prince, you can tell by the Symbol
I move so quick, it's ludicrous, you best get out my way
If I'm losing, don't confuse it, baby, anything can change
I can double-edge dance and cut up a path to show you my bravery
Now I'm calling all campers, sleep on me and get a rude awakening
I won't fail, it's the final exam
Hasn't been a better pair up with Robin since Batman
No copycat, and I'mma soar and slash a hack
I don't even need fire to burn up this track
I'd say this was your end, but I'm producing maneuvers
They're gonna prove that everything is Chrom in your future
And if you think I'm just another blue-haired baddy
Make like Lucina and call me daddy

Do me a Solid, need a hero, give me a holler, huh
I don't make a sound, so nobody hears my enemies falling, uh
Cats might get choked out, huh, shout out to Ocelot
I'm more into action and doing shit, y'all just talk a lot
I'm gon' put my opps in a box, you can't fuck with me
You can't be at ease, there's a soldier in your company
Bitch, you know I'm S-tier, most of y'all is under me
Got rockets in my pockets, if you pussies tryna run from me
Know that it's a band on my head, but they can't take me out
See the percentages rising, no, I don't play around
Combinations crazy, I'm basically saying: "Pray for now"
Ain't talking going steady when I say I'm finna take you out
You can't always see me, but I can always see ya
You best develop your game, that's Okajima, huh
CQC, CDC, call the government
If you ever hear that real low voice, you better run from it

You know I've been this way
I been on one fifty one since the vintage days
I'll make you run with the sun, now you in this rain
'Cause I'm above number one like my business place
You know the kids these days, they be debating the GOAT
It only took a game to do what Ketchum did in the show
I send in Squirtle, way I'm spitting always makin' 'em float
And now the company, my Ditto recreating the flow
I tell 'em, got my green up, I need more
Smoke through leaf green - Ivysaur
League was sleepin' like they're leaving a spore
And now y'all leechin' off the seed I planted, reapin' rewards
I'm like a Charizard - they hating how I'm made this fly
They wanna call me overrated, think the rate's just fine
And all these other rappers flaming, gotta raise their dime
'Cause you at least better be Gold if you gon' make this climb

Ay, OK, woo, it's the big bad Wolf, packing a big mag
Like a Fox Upsmash, they flip from the kick back
Though I'm known for hands like a master when hits land
Know I'm point blank with the blaster, the stick flash
Like gratata, ratata
The claws on me, they cut like katanas, na na na
The crew pull up, we hit the final smash, shalala
We on their heads just like a bandana, clip longer than bananas
I ain't ever been an echo, but I'm reflecting every shot
When the clique connects the sticks like K'nex, you'll end in a Box
Like prosecco, we get 'em shook and pressured, letting it pop
Must be the deadliest vet, I'mma end up deading a Fox
Scrapping with Powalski or Panther, it gets precarious
The DPS from Leon, Caroso, clear the area
A quick reminder, the fliest guy in the Lylat, trust, no one beside him
The finest pilot from Aquas to Corneria

Zach hit me up like: "Hi, do Ken"
So I had to hit him up with a Hadouken
Light foot, side hook, I cook them
Dropping on them from above, that's some high dooking
No Barbie boy, I'm barbarian
Bars bury 'em, barbed wire 'round a barred area
'Cause you can not enter in it with me, no, I dare ya, son
I'll bare foot them, can't bare what I'm
Bringing to the ring, and the ringing is like I'm Tampani hitting
It's like you're swinging with the paddle, and it's pinging and ponging
Big, and I'm bombing, your button mashing flinging shit
And wishing it to be sticking, but there's no combo that's popping
Clicking the options, but can not figure the problem
You're just kicking and spinning without a rhythm, and it's simple to block them
Counter measure is increased, the damage counter measures
Count on Ken to can a kid, can not give him anyone he won't crush
Marrow whacked like a bone rush
Dragonlash if I focus
Hook to the back like a tow truck
Give me Capcom, Namco, Smash Bros, anyone, I won't budge
Can't match to my repertoire
Second thought, but not second class
Echo fighter, but the better half
Steady, left, right, Ready? Set! Fight! かかつてきな!

Pull up with the glizzy, so you know I gotta cock that
Power over swag, but you know that I'm gon' rock that
Campin' by your spawn, I can hear you: "Shara, stop that!"
How you gonna get mad?, you shot first, I'm just gon' pop back
I-N-K-L-I-N-G can't spell that without "king"
Give me the crown, also I'm gunning for your team
Put another star next to my level
This a sink or swim zone, boy, your ink look kinda dry
(Black air force energy) I rock them Kensa Black hi-tops
The way I've got my eye on you, you'd think I'm cyclops
Team captain, I'mma take you to the tippy high top
And take these Octos down a notch
But I ZL on the DL, stack bodies like I stack snails
They say I'm an opp, no, I'm OP, that's facts now
You've heard of Crystal Lake, but have you heard of Camp Triggerfish?
Trigger finger happy, boy, it's all in the wrist, bang

Most people know me as legendary, they hold me up to the greats
Your fate is sharp, I'm the stake
That's driving straight through your heart, I'm on one, I'm awfully cautious of monsters
I've been hunting for hundreds of years, and I'm finally profiting
I'm Simon B, turning demons to dust
For centuries been killing heathens in the castle, I trust
I've got my whip in hand for Dracula's on demand, oh
He's the evil in my way, built my entire brand on
Him, my sins run deep, I've got style
Spin the clocks back, go for a while
Stone cold from Medusa's gaze
Wrap me up in gauze, mummify me straight away
'Cause I'm living forever, yes, I'm the hero of night
I'm the soul that's on fire, you know I live to ignite
I got vampires looking up to me
Saying: "Can we get a taste of what we will never be?"

We're going off the scales, son
Throw an axe, it impales ya
Crack it like a whip, know my brother never slips
And you'll end up in a ditch 'cause my Smash is Ultimate, yeah, uh
All I do is take percents, yeah, uh
Gave one hundred on your head, yeah, uh
Not the kind that makes amends, nah, uh
Like a vamp, you'll wind up dead, yeah, uh
Sign of the cross, if you know what I mean
I've been a boss, and I don't ever bleed
Call me the king, I'm on top of the scene
Yeah, uh
Doubling down with my brother and me
Winning the game, we a hell of a team
Keeping it clean, yeah, we know how to sweep
Yeah, uh
Take anyone in the game
'Cause you and me ain't the same
Leaving you dying in vain
You're burning up into flames
They're cheering, hearing my name
Richter! Richter! Richter!

Good morning, everyone! (hello!) Let me offer some advice
I would turn right back around if it's me I'd have to fight
You should really save your game 'cause I think that you'll be dying soon
Be like: "That a plane?" 'cause of how fast you'll be flying, shoot
Dream town hall when I box them all
Balloon trip, won't fall. Fishing rod on call
No new leaf, zero flaws. Eat paw, bring the heat
On scene, get you beat like "Daw, sorry, that seemed mean"
Give you updates
I bring the brains
Make the hits rain
Swap out Porter, run you down with his train
Don't play
I'll do my best always
Vacation juice and hot takes
I'd say you're all stuck in dog days
Here are some options
Either you lose, or I win
Turnip on top, keep climbing
This time I'm the one deciding
I'll be rising New Horizons
Sorry, please, step aside, miss
Animalese for "don't you try, bitch"
I've heard you bark, but can you bite this?

Take a look at the heel, it's Incineroar
See the highlight reel, and I win 'em all
In the ring, gonna get pinned with my finisher
I would do an armbar, but I bit it off
Shere Khan, but I'm awfully anabolic
Hit a nearfall with a big dropkick
Got ten claws, and they curve with a sharp tip
Split lip, but you get it with a paw print
Like a Benoit submission 'cross the face
Take a headbutt, he won't recall his name
On the way to hall of fame, the roster page
Is wanting what be on the waist
Better contemplate, a contest with a brawny frame
I can launch 'em across the stage
In a match, I'll spark the flames with a Chokeslam
Why would y'all wanna spar with Kane?
Ay, I bruise necks
High bump when he take that suplex
Hit it like Lou Thesz, out of my moveset
With the two pecs when I give 'em that boob flex
Too Lex when I'm doing offense
Vertebrate gonna break, when I'm making it bend
And then away like a plane, when I make 'em ascend
And then it's straight to the pavement awaiting revenge
Straight to chest with that lariat, you'll be turned upside
Down, with the blood pumping, looking buff 'cause I'm muscular, gonna assert my size
Let it burn slow with inferno on the fur coat, you could say that I urn my stripes
Toe to toe with Tony the Tiger, taking Trenbolone, couldn't be worse advice

Who that boy? It's K. Rool
And I pulled up with the K too
Best in the game, I'mma put that to bed
See this crown on my head? 'Cause I can't lose
Propeller pack - how I rise to the top
I just flex on my opps with my B-moves
He wanna scrap, but my gut told him: "nah"
Sending shots, they got back to the same dude
Heavy when I walk
Tell them boys that I ain't ever been a flop
It's a shame 'cause if I'm really tryna mock
I just body him, and bury him, and then I hit my taunt
They said it was ultimate when I came through
But to be honest, though, I'm really tryna brawl
I'm the one they all fear, whilst you just a D-tier
'Cause you never been competitive for sure
Ooh, wait, I been a hazard, put boys in their place
Go with the flow, but ain't no jungle japes
Look at the tears as they stream down his face
Leave him in red just like my cape
Final smashing, pull the blast-o-matic
I just point and aim a laser beam right at him
You a lil' newcomer? Never heard of ya
I'm a legend to the game, I'm a rare figure

It's about to be some killing when he's in the spot
Ridley's up in the building, man, believe it or not
I'm exceedingly hot
Yeah, I know you see the teeth and the wings, you don't know if he's a demon or not
Good 'cause I like it like that, just fall off the stage
You ain't gotta fight back, I might gnaw on your face
Treat you like a light snack, yeah, I spit that fire
And I ain't even talking 'bout rap
Lookin' like something outta the land of the lost
I don't care who's on the level, I can handle them all
If Lord Ridley's on your planet, then your planet will fall
You panicking from all the damage that I'm handing to y'all
Why everybody talking 'bout Samus like Samus a god?
Have you seen these upgrades? My mechanical parts
Will have you all standing in awe, you never stood a chance
Fly down and land on your jaw, I'll dismantle you all
Praise to Lord Ridley, I'm the star right now
Mario and Luigi, they can all pipe down
I don't like nobody in this brawl right now
I don't even like the people that are nodding to this song right now
Strike me down, I'll take a different form again
You gon' hear me laughing in hell 'till I'm born again
Then you're getting stabbed by the tail like a scorpion
Put your name inside the credits, but it's in memoriamEmbed
