1 ContributorGangster of Love LyricsThere was Frank James and Jesse James
Billy the Kid and all the rest
Supposed to have been some bad cats
Way out in the West
Those cats would have of dug me
And my gangster ways
They would have hung up their guns child
And dug into their graves
Coz I'm a gangster of love don't you know
That I'm a gangster  of love
Well now when I walk in a bar
Girls from near and far
Say there's the gangster of love
Well I jumped my mother's Cadillac
I rode across the border line
I roped 55 girls
And kissed them all at the same time
Took 25 or 30 put 'em all on a freight
And there was a million dollar reward for me
In each and every state
Sheriff said "Is your name Johnny "Guitar" Watson?"
In a very deep voice
And I said "Yes, sir brother sheriff
And that's your wife on the back of my horse"
