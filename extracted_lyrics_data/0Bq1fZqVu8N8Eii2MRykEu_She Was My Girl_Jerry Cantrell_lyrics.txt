Copacetic, calm my frenetic
She's the shit, y'all
Highly rated, well-educated
She's an angel
She's ambitious, beautiful, delicious
Got a restaurant
I can take it, truth stripped me naked
And I fucked up...

Yeah

She was my girl
Used to be my world
I miss my girl
What a fine girl

She put together, says she's doing better
Since she let go
Repeating dreamer; now and then, I see her
And we have lunch
Ever playful, hook the jumper cable
Give me fresh spark
Sister ringing, old reminder stinging
Bridges burned hoss...

Yeah

She was my girl
Used to be my world
I miss my girl
What a fine girl
She was my girl
Used to be my world
I miss my girl
What a fine girl


She called me up; I guess she pretty stuck
She needed my help
It made me happy, hence the lyric sappy
I still love her...

Yeah

She was my girl
Used to be my world
I miss my girl
What a fine girl
She was my girl
Used to be my world
I miss my girl (I miss my girl)
What a fine girl (What a fine girl)

Such a fine girl (She's such a fine girl)
I miss my girl
Used to be my world (Can't find it)
She was my girlEmbed
