14 ContributorsWith the Lights On Lyrics
Haha, it's too easy
I just-I just-I just wanna freak you with the lights on

Baby, leave them on, I don't want 'em off
When I see them draws, pucker, pucker, that's a no
We gon' make it grow, pull it to the side
You say you can ride, baby, join me in my ride

(Woohoo), let me hit it in the front, let me hit it in the back now
(Woohoo), to the middle of the club, to the back of the 'lac now
(Woohoo), all around the world, no matter where you at now
I can't wait to give you what you want

Girl, you know you bad like a Mike song, right?
Hope you don't mind I keep my Nikes on, right?
We can film it all on my iPhone 5
I just-I just-I just wanna freak you with the lights on
Girl, you know you bad like a Mike song, right? (Right)
Hope you don't mind I keep my Nikes on, right? (Right)
We can film it all on my iPhone 5 (5)
I just-I just-I just wanna freak you with the lights on (lights on)
