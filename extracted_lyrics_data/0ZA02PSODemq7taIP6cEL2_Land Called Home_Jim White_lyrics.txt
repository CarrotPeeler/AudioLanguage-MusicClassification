2 ContributorsLand Called Home Lyrics
Though the world is sleeping, my eyes are open
Yet it's me that's dreaming, that I'm flying over mountaintops
I am crossing an ocean where at the end I see
I see a beautiful far away land called home
And them stars they sure are pretty, and while I do admire
The distance their light, it travels, to shine down on me
Still I would go further
Than the furthest star shine
Just to find myself walking in a beautiful faraway land called home
Wanna find myself walking in a beautiful faraway land called home
And you can take all the money in all of the banks
You can take all the fame in Hollywood
You can take all the pretty girls in Paris, France
You can take my own name if you think it'll do you some good. You can take all them things that perish
And you can throw them all right in the sea
'Cause ain't but only one thing that matters
Ain't but only one jewel in this world
Ain't but only one feeling of all of life's feeling that I wanna feel. That is the feeling of a beautiful faraway
Land called home
Land called home
Land called home
Land called home
