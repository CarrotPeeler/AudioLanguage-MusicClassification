Oh-oh, yeah

My baby left me sad
He didn't do nothing right
My baby left me
My baby left me dry
My baby left me sad
He didn't do nothing right
My baby left me
My baby left me so dry to the bone
And he left me alone, oh
(Oh-oh, yeah)

Consequences after murder
Situations did you further
Close one eye and dream the rest
I was called the early learner
And you were the heart stirer
But this I never coulda guessed

You pulled on me until you knew I'd break
You might also like
My baby left me sad
He didn't do nothing right
My baby left me
My baby left me dry
My baby left me sad
He didn't do nothing right
My baby left me
My baby left me so dry to the bone
And he left me alone, oh
(Oh-oh, yeah)
(Oh-oh, yeah)

So who's to blame for the messy ending?
You say it's me but we'd be pretending
You work your dirt just like a pro
'Cause you were a
Freedom fighter, compulsive liar
And a real good lucky trier
More than I had ever known

You pulled on me until you knew I'd break

My baby left me sad
He didn't do nothing right
My baby left me
My baby left me dry
My baby left me sad
He didn't do nothing right
My baby left me
My baby left me so dry to the bone
And he left me alone, oh
My baby left my sad
He didn't do nothing right
My baby left me
My baby left me dry
My baby left my sad
He didn't do nothing right
My baby left me
My baby left me so dry to the bone
And he left me alone, oh!

My baby left me sad
He didn't do nothing right
My baby left me
My baby left me dry
My baby left me sad
He didn't do nothing right
My baby left me
My baby left me so dry to the bone
And he left me alone, oh
(Oh-oh, yeah)Embed
