3 ContributorsSmiling Faces Sometimes Lyrics
Smiling faces sometimes pretend to be your friend
Smiling faces show no traces of the evil that lurks within
The truth is in the eyes
'Cause the eyes don't lie, amen
Remember, a smile is just a frown turned upside down, my friend
So hear me when I'm saying

Smiling faces, smiling faces sometimes
They don't tell the truth
Smiling faces, smiling faces tell lies
And I got proof

Beware, beware of the handshake that hides a snake
Beware, beware of the pat on the back
It just might hold you back (Hold you back, yeah)
Jealousy (Jealousy), misery (Misery), envy (Envy)
I tell you, you can't see behind

Smiling faces, smiling faces sometimes
They don't tell the truth
Smiling faces, smiling faces tell lies
And I got proof
(Check it)

Oh, your enemy won't do you no harm
'Cause you'll know where he's coming from
Don't let the handshake and the smile fool ya
Take my advice I'm only tryna school ya

Smiling faces, smiling faces sometimes
They don't tell the truth
Smiling faces, smiling faces tell lies
And I got proof

Lies (Lies), lies (Lies), lies, oh
Lies (Lies), lies (Lies), lies
Don't be pulled in by the charm
A million-dollar smile can be quite costly, so bewareEmbed
