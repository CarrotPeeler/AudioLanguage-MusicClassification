1 Contributor7 day theory LyricsI can live or die
See me standin' across from God
Hands out n' legs together
See its great for the moment
Make the most of it
But I know my time is limited
Cause of my nature
Stay green
But polluitin' my body
Matured like whiskey
On balance, its a natural lifestyle
Whether you need it or want
Or fuck it
Pour out lil' liquor
Cause we got the spirit is us
Shoot you in the mind
Thinking you had a shot
Go for a walk
2 steps ahead
When you run up on me
You tread
Eat you for dinner
Meal, sent to the light
N' its a trek
Cause you went all the way
To see me   gettin' lit
An' now
I am stuck
Pickin' up the pieces
From way back then
To live a peaceful life
Cause I always wanted to be dead
So I rip it
Torn between life an' death
Wear a hood
In over my head
Ride the road name
The streets are callin' me
Up for ends  Pass out on death
Weed be killer
Smoke them
Grass be greener
Try'na keep off the dirt
But nature has its way
Lost my family
Claim that I'm a winner
But they come first
Like alchohol
It runs through my blood
I fucked up
Blank mind
Nothin' in the memory bank
My past life has past me
All I remember is a shot
Like a banger
On what I write
Killed myself   left to rights
Triggered me into havin' a gun
To blow my brains out
Or shoot up the sky
Get shit stirrin'
Cause I'mma Gangster
Jus' wanted to have some fun
Jack a police car
On the Daniels
On the corner  see all the angles
Got a degree in drug dealin'
Out on the street
Walk like I ride
Step to me n' you get rid off
Feet, we go toe to toe  on a song
I believe
Made a mistake
I'm a man n' shes my misses
But I'll never find the one
Cause I lost my world
Manage it on my own
My family don't talk
So we're alone
There's a bigger picture to this
See'in myself die'in for something
Haven't been framed
But put up a wall
Sent to jail
Lowest class
Taught me to be patient
Which i was
Till I lost it
Waitin'  servin' a life sentence
Couldn't talk  cause they would'a used it against me
The truth
You trust noone
Ghost
I was a rider
But had to let go
Rid of
Had faith
But was outta Gods hands
So I would prey
Holdin' on to faith
In time  outta life
Sat down like a damn chair
Spent days starin' into the sky
In the air  till night stars
Times come first
Lifes second
N' deaths freedom
Feel dark like a blank
Thats goes off in a bang
N' Im back where I started
The shot that didn't kill me
I'm still here in silence
So leave a mark
From birth or scarred up
The earth is hurt n' painfulll
Gotta keep killin'
The fait of us is with the planet yo
Gone in a whisper
Been in hell
When I urn to ashes
Won't ever heal
A dog let off the leash
Chain smok'in
Barking mad
Growlin'
Cause I'm sick of feelin' shit in my stomach
Bodys matted
Wonna be cremated
Im grounded
Can stand
But can't step outta line
Restricted
Fuckin' stranger know I'm deranged
Controlled
Push my buttons
But can't make a move
Can't even roll up
Hopin' this weed be killer
Distract me from the realer
So realitys iller on the dicer
Hopin' for a number
Say I'm word
So I'm countin' down
Feelin' like time is going backwards
WIshin' it was over
Life on the clock
Workin' me round an' round
Wastin' away
Knowin' Ill never see purpose again
Feelin' like a accident
Cause I shouldn't of been born for this
Why me?
All this wonderin'
In the lost
Bouncin' off  thought for thought
A fought
Cause all I could think about was fighting for
Natural response  was on defence
In a limited mind
Word for word
Fuck it
Fist instinct
When I was born
I was like fuck this
I rap to God
My mum n' dad had sex for this
Fucked up world
Suicidal
So you my idol
A father figure
Look at the sun
An' hope he burns in hell
I'mma make my worth as Gods man
Got my armour
Bullet proof
Be elite
A pro of sendin' you to the light
Its true  almost died a hundred times
Rued  a meanin' of life I've been through
What it was mean't  to be me
Hearin' voices  jus' think thinking of death
Piercin' my eyes
Cause even my peers couldn't see what was goin' on
Years, spent in one age
Got my mind set on
Live by words of a chosen selection
Choose the be one with myself
Thoughts flowin' like the internet
Like a spider
I creep n' I crawl
So fly  when I get caught on a line
I bounce off
Then right back on beat
Write a song
I wonna know the ins and outs
What the hell is going on
By the highest
Meet  or be dead by it
Many people are gone off
My last words
Would be my mum talkin' about it
Cause I trust her to the end
Sell your soul to the devil
So I got the spirit of god in us
Gifted
So I make it present
Like he lives
Surprising
Ready to die
The mind is universal
It sends you places like travel
Infinite power
You control
When its outta hand you handling
Green is nature  so all colours are natural
Represent where you from
The world is your home
Family is all cause you be nothing without them
Be touchin' death like it feels me
Be ready
Because you can go any time
So fuck it like you won't get sex tomorrow
Sippin'  n' spit it
Throw it up
Its a rap
Wear a glove  cause she left hands on my dick
Cheatin' bitch
But shes a animal in the the sack
Fuck the world
Word  thats sexy
A girl down to earth
A true  dirty  grounded
An' free
N' does good for the family
Out with me
An' shes a bad bitch
Peach ass
Got me preachin'
Cause even God can't look away
Perky tits
Like you get the point
Added
Straight poking
Touch  like shes smooth as the pussy
Silky
Bronze skin  caramel
Lets ge it on
I got the goods
To make you a bad bitch
Sex
Fuck the ex's
Pleasurin' fora purpose
An' still have no accidents
Make love cause I was made of hate
So fuck you with my heart
Its beat  but I'm still bangin' herYou might also likeEmbed
