1 ContributorMy Time After A While Lyrics
It's your time now baby
But oh, I gotta a feeling it's gonna be my time after while
I said it's your time right now baby
But oh, I gotta a feeling it's gonna be my time after while
You know, you know if things don't change
Woah, I've gotta move on down the line

She stayed out last night
And do you know she just walked in
That girl is getting ready
She's going back out again
I said wait one minute baby
Just before you go
She didn't even look at me
She just walked right out the door

It's your time now baby
But oh, I gotta a feeling it's gonna be my time after while
You know, you know if things don't change
Woah, I've gotta move on down the line

I took a peek through my window
And what you think I seen
My baby setting beside another man
In a long black limousine
You might also like
It's your time right now baby
Woah, I got that feeling
I got that feeling it's gonna be my time after while
You know, you know if things don't change
Woah, I've gotta move on down the line

Woah, I just wanna talk to my baby
And here's what I wanna say
Go ahead and mistreat me baby
But every, every dog got his day
I just, I said I want to talk to my baby
Just want to talk to my baby
I just want to talk to my baby
Ahh, I gotta talk to my babyEmbed
