1 ContributorI Gotta Sang The Blues Lyrics
Oh, yeah
I'm not gonna stop singin’ the blues

People keep askin' why I sang the blues
I say: "It's easy for me"
If you take time to walk in my shoes
The blues comes easy, you see
But I refuse to stay in the past
Bad times, they come and they go
I live my life like today is the last
That’s why I want y'all to know

That I gotta sang the blues (Sang the blues)
When livin' the blues gets too rough
I got to sang the blues (Sang the blues)
'Cause tough times I had enough

My friends keep askin' how this came to be
The blues is in me so strong
I can't deny it's my destiny
That's why I’ve lasted so long
Not rich with money, I got what I need
For me, it’s more than enough
I raised my daughter, then my family
The blues ain't been nothing but good to me
You might also like
I gotta sang the blues (Sang the blues)
When livin’ the blues gets too rough
Yeah, I got to sang the blues (Sang the blues)
'Cause tough times I had enough
Yeah, I gotta sang the blues (Sang the blues)
I'm tellin' you that’s where it all starts
Yeah, I got to sang the blues (Sang the blues)
It's rooted right here in my heart

I'm steppin' out from my down home blues
Got to let these good times roll
I'm gonna wang-dang-doodle without writers and seek
Bright lights, big city, my baby and me


Well, well, I'm steppin' out with these down home blues
Got to let these good times roll
I'm gonna wang-dang-doodle without riders and seek
Bright lights, big city, my baby and me
Yeah, yeah, hey, hey

I gonna sang (Gotta sang the blues, gotta sang)
When livin' the blues gets too rough, y'all
I got to sang the blues (Gotta sang the blues, gotta sang)
Tough times sure had enough
Well, well, I'm gonna sang (Gotta sang the blues, gotta sang)
I'm telling you that's where it all starts
I've got to sang the blues (Gotta sang the blues, gotta sang)
Aw, the music right here down deep in my heart
I've got to sang the blues (Gotta sang the blues, gotta sang)
I'm gonna wang-dang-doodle all night long
I gotta sang the blues (Gotta sang the blues, gotta sang)
Got me a big boss to take me home
I gotta sang, well, I'm gonna sang
("I heard you sang those blues, baby")
How-how-howdy, I'm gonna sang the blues
I'm gonna sang the blues
Ain't never gonna stop singin' the blues
Big Mama Thornton sang the blues
Koko Taylor sang the blues
Hoo, Etta James sang the blues.  Yes, yes
("Hahahaha.  I know exactly what you're saying")
("Let's take it on home now")
(Gotta sang the blues, gotta sang)
(Gotta sang the blues, gotta sang)Embed
