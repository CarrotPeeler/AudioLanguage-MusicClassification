2 ContributorsPowerless LyricsShe lays there helpless
Alone in the darkness
My chest is so heavy with pain you can’t describe, you can't describe
Sliced, cut, why?
Skin so raw
I’ve never been so frightened, so, so, so enlightened
What kind of god does this?
We were so powerless
Summertime, we saw the king die
What kind of god does this?
Does anyone care?
Living nightmares
We were so powerless
Breathing heavy as I remember those months
Throat tightens
I wish I were strong like you
What kind of god does this?
We were so powerless
Summertime, we saw the king die
What kind of god does this?
Does anyone care?
Living nightmares
We were so powerless

We were so powerless
Powerless
We were so powerless
Powerless
We were so powerless
Powerless
We were so powerlessEmbed
