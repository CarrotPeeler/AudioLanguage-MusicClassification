I don't know how long I've got
There is no certain way of knowing
When it's time for the full stop
In this time that I've been given
As I try to fill my days
Everything slips out of focus
The familiar things seem strange
The road ahead looks shorter than the one behind
Either way, I'm no closer to wisdom
There are lots of ugly people in this world
I know because I'm one
When I get a chance I'll step out of the shadows
And turn my face into the sun
The road ahead looks shorter than the onе behind
Either way, I'm no closer to wisdom
Thе road ahead looks shorter than the one behind
Either way, I'm no closer to wisdom
And, we wait
There are things that I will miss
When everything is done
The comfort of our skin
The whisper of our blood

Either way, I'm no closer to wisdom
The road ahead looks shorter than the one behind
Either way, I'm no closer to wisdom
And, we waitEmbed
