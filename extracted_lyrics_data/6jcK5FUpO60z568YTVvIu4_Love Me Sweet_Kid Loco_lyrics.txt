1 ContributorLove Me Sweet LyricsMe and my babe went to the show
I and babe went to the show
Did we sit on the end? no
'cause a fallen girl was in the very front row
She got real lace curtains on her door
She got brussels carpets on the floor
But she don't wear no silk or lace
No, lords, she don't wear no corsetwaist
So love me sweet, my dear sweet lucy
Love me sweet, my pretty baby
Love me sweet, baby sweet lucy
Love me sweet, pretty baby
Now babe's gone'n I won't come home
Now babe's gone'n I won't come home
Or with my clothes all wrinkled
And my hair ain't sittin' just right in the middle
She makes me want things I never had
She makes me want things I never had
Baby, there's too many things I never had
And too many things I will never have
And you're the best that it is
And I need you baby, please
'cause you're the best that it is
And I need you in all my bizYou might also likeEmbed
