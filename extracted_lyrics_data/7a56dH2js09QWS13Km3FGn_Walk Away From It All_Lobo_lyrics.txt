1 ContributorWalk Away From It All LyricsWhen you get through
With what you thought
You had to do
You've realized you'd
Never find
That all important
Peace of mind
When you feel
You want to shout
That's freedom calling out
To You
Stand up
Face right
And walk away from it all
Walk away from it all
Walk away from it all
If what you're doing doesn't
Do it to you
Walk away from it all
If it seems the life you live
Doesn't have enough to give
And you feel it ties you down
And your brain begins to pound
The more you try to hurry
The more you have to worry
