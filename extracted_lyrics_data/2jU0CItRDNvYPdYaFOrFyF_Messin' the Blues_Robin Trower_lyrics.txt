Drink my life from an empty cup
I ain't taking no messin' from the likes of you
There ain't no messin' now mess with the blues
Messin' the blues, messin' the blues
Messin' the blues, messin' the blues
Well lonely days and lonely nights
Tell your honey that it just ain't right
Well baby baby don't let me be blue
'cause there ain't no messin' like messin the blues
Messin' the blues
Fine little belly got a gleam in my eye
Ask no questions and I get no lies
I ain't no angel but I end up used
Down, down, down with the blues
Down with the blues
Dealin' the blues
