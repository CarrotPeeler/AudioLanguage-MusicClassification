5 ContributorsRoots in Stereo Lyrics
P.O.D. and Matisyahu
Original roots in stereo, ya know
One time, bring it down selecta

I got that boom bye, bye, so nobody disrespect, Jah love
Give me strength and power flow through I dreads ('Nough said)
You all walk with kings, talk with kings
When it all goes down, have no idea what it really means
To live by words and scripture is roots
And the wise hold they tongue when the youth speak the truth
You learn real quick, where I'm from if you don't belong
Only the strong survive, Southtown and Babylon
(See Babylon burnin' to the ground yo)
You think your number one wicked selecta
Try to sneak up in my hood, we not gon' let ya
(Babylon's burnin' to the ground, yo)
In the streets they hear your name, they no respect ya
You can run and hide, in the end we gon' getcha

Boom biddy bye, bye
Original roots in stereo
So rep the streets you ride on
Chant them down with that rude boy sound
And watch the whole world lie down
We generals in the streets they know
Who wears the crown for shine now
It got that champion sound moshin' through your town
We go make the world go lie down
You might also like
Me say, Hey natty dreadlocks where you come from?
Where the mountains watch the city and waters touch the sun
Where some carry crosses like others carry guns
And pray Jah be glorified till the day soon come
Follow me
Lick a shot if you a mighty warrior
Lick a shot if you a freedom fighter
Lick a shot if you a true souljah
Now dance your way back to Zion
Now Dance your way back to Zion
I put it down for your love, till my journey is done
And let the stories be told how the battle was won
So I grabbed the microphone and I started to run
Here I come, Boom biddy bye
Here I come, Boom biddy bye, bye

Original roots in stereo
So rep the streets you ride on
Chant them down with that rude boy sound
And watch the whole world lie down
We generals in the streets they know
Who wears the crown for shine now
It got that champion sound moshin' through your town
We go make the world go lie down
We go make the world go lie down
Make the world go lie down
Empty nation just a phase, redemptions on it's way
The people love to talk but they don't got that much to say
Generation of orphans whose hearts are all ablaze
Little light in a lot of darkness goes a long way
Freedom, hearts bleed, and I see them feedin poison
Poor choices, spirits screamin, trying to break these boundaries
Running up a mountain, chains tied to my feet
Running up a mountain, chains tied to my feet

Original roots in stereo
So rep the streets you ride on
Chant them down with that rude boy sound
And watch the whole world lie down
We generals in the streets they know
Who wears the crown for shine now
It got that champion sound moshin' through your town
We go make the world go lie down
We go make the world go lie down
Make the world go lie down

Bloodstain drippin through the rain
Face down, trip and feel the pain
Get up, you conduct your own train, rippin it up, stepping it up, raising it up
We're the blood of God's veins, we gotta maintain get past the blame
And then this fame came, for a reason and a season
Then I'll stay up, not lay low
And raise yours and up the offering
And then the blessings will flow
We go make the world go lie down
Make the world go lie down
We go make the world go lie down
Make the world go lie down

Dripping in the rain, face down, trip and feel the pain
Get up, you conduct your own train, rippin it up, stepping it up, raising it up
We're the blood of God's veins, we gotta maintain past that of blame
Gathers fame, came for a reason and a seasons
Here to stay up, not lay lowEmbed
