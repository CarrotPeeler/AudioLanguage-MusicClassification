1 ContributorAdam’s Ale LyricsRed is the blood smoothly running through
Orange is the vitamin His creatures consume
Yellow's the joys of isles remote
Green is the lea in which His fauna can grow
Blue is the sea
(Father God, wash over me)
His indigo children receive
(With your myriad streams of thee, aquamarine)
And until we're crowned His violet kings
Let's all consume what He brings
(Lo 'donai, come!)
For we are all human beings
(Lo 'donai, come! O Sai!)
Ready, set, one, two
My body's up when the sun's up too
As my spirit to comes to
I look around and I wonder what's new
Swim around in the coastal cypress
Crystal by the crown, gotta cleanse the mindset
Table of fruit and flora, dairy, and white bread
Read the blessed verse of the Lamb 'til I'm fed
As we each blossom like day spring
There's a little black boy who can't sing
His vocals been stolen by the hate
And he's breaking, said the world's gone crazy
Maybe we should start equating
Instead of discriminating
God does not consider rankings
And bias when He's creating
You might also likeChildren, a composition of
His dust, His breath, His love
Free of the brother blood that we don
Unaware of the hatred we spawn
Forget what man told us and reclaim
We all bathe in and consume the same
Sea of the Lord (Water of God)
Sea of the Lord (Water of God)
Sea of Adonai Himself
What makes me different from you?
Cuz I like men as well?
Does my harmless self-expression
Mean I get sent to hell?
What makes me inferior?
My third-place-medal skin?
Does the music I make and enjoy
Mean I'm friends with sin?
This is our planet, man we all on the same boat
Moonlit dancers and lions drinking lavas from lakes
So why do you feel the need to be repulsed by a rainbow
When it's a sign you can take off your raincoat
When the pain goes?
Children, a composition of
His Dust, His Breath, His Love
Free of the brother blood that we don
Unaware of the hatred we spawn
Forget what man told us and reclaim
We all bathe in and consume the same
Sea of the Lord (Water of God)
Sea of the Lord (Water of God)
Sea of Adonai Himself
Isn't it wonderful to see
Familiar blood when we bleed?
As precious as coral, and happy to need
Water running clear, if at all
Apples to consume when they fall
Isn't it wonderful to see
Familiar blood when we bleed?
As precious as coral, and happy to need
Water running clear, if at all
Apples to consume when they fall
Let me try this one again
Red is the rotten tomatoes they throw
When they hate my performance
It's something about my flamboyance
They don't find appealing like an orange
They wanna see Roman yellow-bellied
But I try my hardest flourish
Why is everybody too busy staring at green trees?
Now we can't see the forest
My cerulean heart is enormous
I got love like water overflowing
From my purple stone to the purple throne
Everybody's of equal importance
Throw away the black and white
And paint the world with the colors before us
Colored skin, colored love
Colored clothes, and colorful auras
If they don't like what to them is unknown
They work hard to get rid of it
Shooting the gun on the soil of a planet
Taken over by the bigoted
Under that soil are peculiar flora
That refuse to be inhibited
A polychromatic array of community
And support is what's exhibited
Yuh! I was born to be harlequin
It's in my cards to be variegated
I come from the ruby red state of Texas
I expect them to be aggravated
They can believe that it's calculated
Like I'm working under an agenda
They can keep thinkin' we don't drink their water
Cuz we gon' be swimming forever
(Amor non odium)
Oh, why don't we all separate from skin
And let the water overflow?
(Separate from skin and let the
Water run all over you)
Why don't we all separate from skin
And let the water overflow?
(Separate from skin and let the
Water run all over you)
Why don't we all separate from skin
And let the water overflow?
(Separate from skin and let the
Water run all over you)
Why don't we all just let the water
Overflow all on us?
(Let the water run all over)
