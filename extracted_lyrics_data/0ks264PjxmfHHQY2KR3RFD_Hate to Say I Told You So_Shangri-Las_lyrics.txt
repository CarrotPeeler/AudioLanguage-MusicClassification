1 ContributorHate to Say I Told You So Lyrics
I told you I'd get even
And it wouldn't be too nice
And now you're sorry baby
You laughed at my advice

Hate to say I told you so
But I told you so
Hate to say I told you so
But I told you so

Well I told you
You'd be crying
If you didn't
Stop your lying
I warned you everyday
But you had to learn the hard, hard way

Hate to say I told you so
But I told you so
Hate to say I told you so
But I told you so
You might also like
Well I walked out
Now you're sorry
Stop your flirtin'
In a hurry
I warned you not to fool
But you were such a stubborn mule

I believed in you
But you couldn't be true
'Cause you just had to have your kicks
So you messed around
Played around
And got yourself in a fix

Hate to rub it in this way
But I told you so
Hate to rub it in this way
But I told you so

(Well I told you)
You'd be crying
If you didn't
Stop your lying
I warned you еveryday
But you had to learn the hard ,hard way
Hatе to say I told you so
But I told you so
Hate to say I told you so
But I told you so

Hate to say I told you so
But I told you so
Hate to say I told you so
But I told you so...Embed
