3 ContributorsJust Wanna Sex You LyricsI'm an addict when it comes to makin' love
I need it 24/7, that's for sure
Like the Energizer bunny, I keep going and going and going and going
Anywhere you want it that's all good with me
Cause I'm an animal and it's time for me to freak
I can take slow or I can beat it up, beat it up, beat it up

Oh baby I want
Sex in the mornin'
Sex in the evenin'
Sex in my Jeep
Girl I wanna freak you
Sex on my lunch break
Sex at the work in
Sex in a strange place
I just wanna sex you babe
When it comes to sex all night, girl I'm the one
It's badly at the hood, girl I'm the one
Girl I like it when you tease me, make me want it, make me want it, make me want it
Oo make me want it, yea
I got a thing for sexy lips and curvy hips
But nothing can compare to sexy legs, no
If you want this? next to you, be ready, be ready

When it comes to sexin all night long
