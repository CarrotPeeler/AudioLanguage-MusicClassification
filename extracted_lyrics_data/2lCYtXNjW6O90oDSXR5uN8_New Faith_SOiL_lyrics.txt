1 ContributorNew Faith LyricsGod friend everybody's got a plan
An even eye can't tell
Wrong from right
We just fade away
God damn tell me what's your plan
So I will never stop
To question why
Each and everyday
Heaven sent, ya need more
Hells sure, I'm yours
Everybody's gotta rock
Right outta here
See the old faith
Feel the new faith
Everybody's gotta rock
Right outta here
See the old face
Know the real face
Feel the real faith
Fly high cut the dove in your brain
Exhale with the taste of everyday
We just fade away
Each and everyday
You might also likeScream loud with the pain
Of yesterday
Stand proud for yesterday
Has gone away
It just fades away
Heaven sent, ya need more
Hell's sure, I'm yours
I'd die, ten fold
I'm sure, I'm yoursEmbed
