This is a man's world
This is a man's world
But it wouldn't be nothing
Nothing
Without a woman or a girl

You see
Man made the cars
To take us over the road
Man made the trains
To carry the heavy loads
Man made the electric light
To take us out of the dark
Man made the boat for the water
Like Noah made the ark

This is a man's world
A man's world
But it wouldn't be nothing
Nothing
Without a woman or a girl

Man thinks about a little baby girl
And a baby boy
Man makes them happy
'Cause man makes them toys
And after man has made everything
Everything he can
You know that man makes that money
To buy from other man
You might also like
This is a man's world
But it wouldn't be nothing
Not one little thing
Without a woman or a girl
No, no, ah...

The world would be nothing without a woman
Woman or a girl, oh yeah
This a man's world, oh, it's a man's world
But it wouldn't be nothing
Nothing
Without a woman or a girl, oh no no
You know I mean it, oh oh oh
But it wouldn't be nothing
Not one little thing
Without a woman or a girl, ooh ooh ooh
This is a man's world
This is a man's world, this is a man's world
Hey, oh no no no no
You see, it's a man's world, man's world
But it wouldn't be nothing...1Embed
