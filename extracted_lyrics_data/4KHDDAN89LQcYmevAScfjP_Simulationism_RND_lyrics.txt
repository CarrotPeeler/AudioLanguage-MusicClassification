Corruption, regression
Were we ever so slow, bendable and easy prey
Tell us how and we say when
Passengers of the messenger
Aggression, medication
Redemption, simulations
Slowly let myself go into the fire if you say so
Oh my master I'll behave, I’ll bend over on a plate
Let it in, let it out. Fading out into the sinister malevolence
All is lost in this human dеcay
A werewolf in disguise, a mothеrless child
Raised by denial and punishing
Blood-red is the moon, it's writing your doom
Erased by the dawn of light
Bare naked and used
Forever the fool who wasted it all
I came and I saw. I gained and I lost. I wasted it allYou might also likeEmbed
