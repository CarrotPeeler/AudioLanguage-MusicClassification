I am hunting for your soul
It dwells within your heart
I lacerate the pounding flesh
Your spirits shall be mine

So rise, my spirit rise
Revel in this dead mans' body
Grip his soul, sip the blood
Life in death, a holy carnage

Ravenous
I will be a God
Carnivorous Jesus
I need your flesh

Ritual slaughter, fill up the chalice
With the essence of your life
Liquid strengths trapped in your veins
I crave your blood, you must die

Ravenous
I will be a God
Carnivorous Jesus
I need your flesh
