1 ContributorFrench Cancan (version anglaise) LyricsI met this pretty boy in Paris
He used to tell me that I'm jolie
I couldn't say a word, just Coco choco Chanel, Coco Chanel chocolat
In my heart, in my veins
I just couldn't take him out of my brain
Just a glance, I'm in trance
This French fella was cute as hell
On my mind, in my bed
I just couldn't stop staring at him
Just a kiss, French kiss
I couldn't say a word just stuttering
Coco choco Chanel, Coco
Coco choco Chanel and chocolat
How stupid is that? I should tell him
Remember the night he came in my life
Monsieur Scandalous, it's driving me insane
Tell me the sweetest words I could ever hear
Monsieur Scandalous, je suis enchantée
Monsieur Scandalous, don't you hesitate
Show me the biggest love I could ever feel
Monsieur Scandalous, don't tell me that you're too shy
In my life, in my dreams
This man couldn't walk away from my hips
Just a bite on my lips
I couldn't say a word just stuttering

Coco choco Chanel and chocolat
How stupid is that? I should tell him
Remember the night he came in my life
Monsieur Scandalous, it's driving me insane
Tell me the sweetest words I could ever hear
Monsieur Scandalous, je suis enchantée
Monsieur Scandalous, don't you hesitate
Show me the biggest love I could ever feel
Monsieur Scandalous, don't tell me that you're too shy
I met this pretty boy in Paris
He used to tell me that I'm jolie
I called him pretty names like chéri
Coco choco Chanel, Coco Chanel chocolat
Monsieur Scandalous, it's driving me insane
Tell me the sweetest words I could ever hear
Monsieur Scandalous, je suis enchantée
Monsieur Scandalous, don't you hesitate
Show me the biggest love I could ever feel
