2 ContributorsBeep Beep Love Lyrics
She landed on my roof
Mad love from Venus
Her ship ran out of gas
Fast as light, love came between us
Flashing girl, out of space
I'll never turn you off
Future love

That's right, that's right, that's right
We're making future love tonight
That's right, that's right, that's right
We're making future love tonight

It's alright if I love you
It's alright if I don't
I'm not afraid that you're running away
'Cause I got the feeling, honey, that you won't
Supersonic lazy love
I'll never turn you off
Future love

That's right, that's right, that's right
We're making future love tonight
That's right, that's right, that's right
We're making future love tonight
You might also like
All you need is (beep beep) love
All you need is (beep beep) love
Love is such a deep, deep feeling

Future love
Future love
Future love
Future love is on the rise

That's right, that's right, that's right
We're making future love tonight
That's right, that's right, that's right
We're making future love tonight

She landed on my roof
Mad love from Venus
Her ship ran out of gas
Fast as light, love came between us
Flashing girl, out of space
I'll never turn you off
Future love
All you need is (beep beep) love
All you need is (beep beep) love
Love is such a deep, deep feeling

Future love
Future love
Future love
Future love is on the rise

That's right, that's right, that's right

That's right, that's right, that's right

That's right, that's right, that's right
We're making future love tonight
That's right, that's right, that's right
We're making future love tonight
That's right, that's right, that's right
We're making future love tonight
That's right, that's right, that's right
We're making future love tonight
That's right, that's rightEmbed
