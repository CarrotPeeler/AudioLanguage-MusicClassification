2 ContributorsStep & Flow Lyrics

Try to keep up with me
Cause I can give you some
All the loving you need
I give you such a rush
Baby step up your game
Keep up with my pace
Girl I know that you want it
Don't hesitate
I want you behind my bedroom doors
Ready or not, we're about to speed up
I'm lovin' you girlYou might also likeEmbed
