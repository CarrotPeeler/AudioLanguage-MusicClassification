Higher and higher
I'm building seek
Consumed by desire
It's killing me
Like a moth to the fire
I go willingly
With windows of fame but they can't keep it safe so

I built this wall, all around me
I built this wall, to surround me
I build this wall, from the ground see
These sticks and stones can't break these tones, no
Shout out
Shout out
Shout out all you want to

I suppose call me Mr., Please Acknowledge me
Self imposed I'm a prisoner, no apologies
Wrote a note to my listeners, don't you follow me
I'm probably strange but I know I can change cos

I don't wanna be alone anymore
There's a hole in my soul
Yet I'm happy at home no
You might also like
I built this wall, all around me
I built this wall, to surround me
I build this wall, from the ground see
These sticks and stones can't break these tones, no

Put a needle on the record
Wait a second
But I reckon
Y'all don't know the boy can get low
Here we go, can you play like Stevie Wonder?
They want the lightening and the thunder
It's about how
We 'bout to hit you with the new style
Have you singing new child
You ain't been this happy in a while

(I built this wall) I built this wall, all around me
(I built this wall) I built this wall, to surround me
(I built this wall) I build this wall, from the ground see
These sticks and stones can't break these tones, no
Shout out
Shout out
Shout out all you want to
I built this wall!Embed
