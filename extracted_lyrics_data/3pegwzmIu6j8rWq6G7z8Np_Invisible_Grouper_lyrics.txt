Invisible
I've become invisible
A light shining through my skin
Never slows down

I've run out of things to say
I found something
If you can see me, be sure to let me know
Hold down my shadow, tie down my sail

Invisible
I've become invisible
Of course I 
And after 

Be sure my brook and the mirror are hading 
The slow, steady rain is eroding and fading
This skin and this body, the spirit's the only thing
I've got it 

Invisible
I've become invisible
Or maybe I always was, just didn't knowYou might also likeEmbed
