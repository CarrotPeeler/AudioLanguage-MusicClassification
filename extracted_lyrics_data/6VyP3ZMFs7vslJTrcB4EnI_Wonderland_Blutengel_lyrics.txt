1 ContributorWonderland LyricsYou wake up crying in the night
And you feel this pain inside
You feel so lonely feel so weak
And you have no words to speak
There's no one to hold you tight
Another nightmare in this night
You just want someone beside you
But there's nothing you can do
I will take you by the hand and I'll show you wonderland
Is this the place where you can hide from the world that makes you cry
There's no darkness there's no light you can see without your eyes
You only feel a warm embrace that will last forever...
You open the window and cry in the night
To the stars so far away
And you hope and pray tonight
For a wonder
You listen to your broken heart
And you understand the words

So you spread your wings to flyEmbed
