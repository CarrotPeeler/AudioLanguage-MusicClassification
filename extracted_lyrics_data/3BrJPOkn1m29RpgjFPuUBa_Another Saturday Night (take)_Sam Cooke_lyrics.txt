1 ContributorAnother Saturday Night (Alternate Take) LyricsAnother Saturday night and I ain't got nobody
I've got some money 'cause I just got paid
Now how I wish I had someone to talk to
I'm in an awful way
I got in town a month ago
I've seen a lot of girls since then
If I could meet 'em, I could get 'em
But as yet I haven't met 'em
That's why I'm in the shape I'm in
Here another Saturday night and I ain't got nobody
I've got some money 'cause I just got paid
Now how I wish I had someone to talk to
I'm in an awful way
Now another fella told me
He had a sister who looked just fine
Instead of being my deliverance
She had a strange resemblance
To a cat name Frankenstein
Here another Saturday night and I ain't got nobody
I've got some money 'cause I just got paid
Now how I wish I had some chick to talk to
I'm in an awful way
Yeah, it is another weekend and I ain't got nobody
Mad about that old man might be swinging
Two chicks on my, oh yeah
Listen to me
It's hard on a fella
When he don't know his way around
If I don't find me a honey
To help me spend this money
I'm gonna have to blow this town
Here it's another Saturday night and I ain't got nobody
I've got some money 'cause I just got paid
Now how I wish I had some chick to talk to
I'm in an awful, everybody sing
Another Saturday night and I ain't got nobody
I've got some money 'cause I just got paid
Now how I wish I had some chick to talk to
I'm in an awful wayYou might also likeEmbed
