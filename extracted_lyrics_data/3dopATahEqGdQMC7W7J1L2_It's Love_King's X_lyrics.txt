4 ContributorsItâ€™s Love LyricsI sit in a chair reflecting back upon my life
And I have so much yet to learn and so much yet to see and do
It's love that holds it all together
I just had to let you know
That it's love that's holding back the weather
And the same will let it go
I sit on the beach feeling the wind, feeling your hand
In all there's a ship on the ocean and I can't decide if I like it
It's love that holds it all together
I just had to let you know
That it's love that's holding back the weather
And the same will let it go
Ahh
Ahh
It's love that holds it all together
I just had to let you know
That it's love that's holding back the weather
And the same will let it go
It's love that holds it all together
I just had to let you know
That it's love that's holding back the weather
And the same will let it go
