2 ContributorsHere Today and Gone Tomorrow LyricsBe careful who you love
It can cause you pain and sorrow
'Cause the way most lovers are (most lovers are)
Here today, gone tomorrow (gone tomorrow)
In this game of take and give
There are those who like to borrow
Be it money or your heart
Here today, gone tomorrow
Time was when sweethearts married
And settled down
But in this age, in this age that we live in
Lovers keep running around
When you break another's hеart
Causing tears and spreading sorrow
Hmm, it can also turn on you
Herе today but gone tomorrow
Here today, gone tomorrow (gone tomorrow)You might also likeEmbed
