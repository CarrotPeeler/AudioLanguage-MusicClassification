Mother nature's back in town
I'm here to take care of business
Ain't got time to fool around
I'm looking for my man ya'll
I'm serious as a heart attack
Now one a-you women stole him
And I'm here to get him back
Don't mess with mother nature
Cause you'll be sorry if you do
I'll rain on your parade
And I'll stomp all over you
I got up early early this morning
I had lovin on my mind
Would have found me someone else
But I'm not the cheating kind
So I'm giving you fair warning
Every word I say is true
If you've got my man turn him loose
If you know what's good for you
Don't mess with mother nature
You'll be sorry if you do
I'll rain on your parade
And I'll stomp all over you
You might also likeI'm just about through talking
I've said all I have to say
And if you think I'm bluffing
Go ahead and make my day
I'll be on you like a lightning
I've got thunder in my hand
I'll do whatever it takes
But I'm being the best I can
Don't mess with mother nature
You'll be sorry if you do
I'll rain on your parade
And I'll stomp all over youEmbed
