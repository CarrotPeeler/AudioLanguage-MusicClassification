Does it show
I'm gonna loose control
So you know
I'm gonna keep you up all night
That's right
I won't let you go
O yeah you're fine
I know we can do it right, you and I
I let you hold my body tight
Don't be shy
O come on let it go
O come on, give me some
I need stereo fun
Make me dance
Make me move
Play my favourite song
Plug it in and turn me on!
O come on , give me some
Baby you've just begun
Make me dance, make me move
Come on everyone
Plug it in and turn me on
Plug it in and turn me on
You might also likeI'm still on the dance floor
Take me home
Than maybe we can dance for more
All alone
I'll show you how to move me right
Tonight
O boy it's time to go
O come on, give me some
I need stereo fun
Make me dance
Make me move
Play my favourite song
Plug it in and turn me on!
O come on , give me some
Baby you've just begun
Make me dance, make me move
Come on everyone
Plug it in and turn me on
Plug it in and turn me on
Baby everybody knows
I've got no where else to go
See I'm made of flesh and bones
So you've got to take me home
O come on, give me some
I need stereo fun
Make me dance
Make me move
Come on after rewind
Plug it in and turn me on
Plug it in and turn me on
O come on , give me some
Baby you've just begun
Make me dance, make me move
Come on everyone
Plug it in and turn me on
O come on, give me some
I need stereo fun
Make me dance
Make me move
Play my favourite song
Plug it in and turn me on!
O come on , give me some
Baby you've just begun
Make me dance
Make me move
Come on everyone
Plug it in and turn me on
Plug it in and turn me onEmbed
