4 ContributorsThe Odds LyricsMaybe we're the lucky ones
'Cause we can choose to turn it off
Maybe we're the lonely ones
'Cause we decide to shield what's soft
I'm sure you'll learn to dance and drink and dream
But you might still feel lost
And I see myself in you my friend
But I would break where you would bend
I'm calling on what you defend and tonight I won't hold back
Just don't waste all your years
Believing in the fear
You'll choke out what's alive and make
What's wrong be all that's real
I can see you're weakened at the seams
And trying to swim upstream but can't find a way
So here we are again trying to hold back
The tides behind our eyes
Lucky ones trying to drink from both the wells we claim are dry
I guess I've found some freedom in
Embracing every time they pry
You might also likeWe're both the same
You're just like me
And when your skin finally sheds
You'll find your nerves all in shreds
The price may be to keep your heart you'll lose your headEmbed
