6 ContributorsCome Wander With Me LyricsHe said, "Come wander with me, love
Come wander with me
Away from this sad world
Come wander with me"
He came from the sunset
He came from the sea
He came from my sorrow
And can love only me
Oh, where is the wanderer?
Who wandered this way
He's passed on his wandering
And will never go away
Come wander with me, love
Come wander with me
Away from this sad world
Come wander with me
He sang of a sweet love
Of dreams that would be
But I was sworn to another
And could never be free
The Rayfords were brothers
Four men tall and bold
And for one I was chosen
With my love still untold
They heard of the wanderer
They heard he loved me
They heard of...

Bespoke unto me
Struck him down in his anger
‘Neath an old willow tree
By the lake where our love dwelt
‘Neath an old willow tree
You killed Billy Rayford
‘Neath an old willow tree
They sought out their brother
And found him alone
They wept by the lakeside
For a boy hardly grown
They wept by the lakeside
And vowed he must die
The wandering stranger...1Embed
