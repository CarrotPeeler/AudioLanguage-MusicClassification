Ahh ah ahh
Ahh ah ahh
Ahh ah ahh
Ahh ah ahhh ahh
Ahh ah ahh
Ahh ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah ah ah

Velvet stairs, easy chairs
Perfumed air gently blowing
Chandeliers, light appears
Burning bright crystal glowing
People come, people go;
Wave of life overflowing
Come, begin! In old Berlin
You're in the Grand Hotel
               
Grand Hotel,             Grand Hotel!
Grand Hotel
Music constantly playing!
Grand Hotel
Living well
Where the wealthy are staying!
Round and round
Hear the sound
Hear what people are saying!
It's the din of old Berlin
You're in the Grand Hotel
You might also like
Velvet stairs
Easy chairs
Perfumed air gently blowing!
Chandeliers
Light appears
Burning bright, crystal
Glowing!

At the Grand, you are at the Grand
At the Grand, you are at the Grand
At the Grand, you are at the
Grand Hotel
At the Grand, you are at the Grand
At the Grand, you are at the Grand
Grand Hotel

In they come, out the go;
Wave of life overflowing
Come, begin! In old Berlin
You're in the Grand Hotel!

Grand Hotel, Berlin. Always the same
People come, people go
Look at them! Living the high life
But time is running out
Elizaveta Grushinskaya: A fabled ballerina on her farewell tour
Raffaela Ottanio, her devoted companion
Hermann Preysing: A businessman reporting to his stockholders
Frieda Flaemm: A typist, but not for long
Otto Kringelein: A bookkeeper looking for life
The young and handsome baron Felix Amadeus Benvenuto von Gaigern: A nobleman - and a thief. There's nothing more useless on this planet than a nobleman without money

Come, begin! In old Berlin
You're in the Grand Hotel

Some have, some have not!
Some have, some have not!
Some have, some have not!

God!

Heavier everyday!

Business must be good

They're raking it in

All of their offers



Every bum and bitch in old Berlin is rich except for us!

Some have, some have not!
Why?
They're in here spending money, a million marks a day
We're one step from the street, making just enough to eat!
For a day, week, month, year, with a thousand bills to pay!
They have us run to hail their cabs, while they're running up their tabs, drinking magnums of champagne
And we play for tips on the mark, frank, dollar, pound

I'd like to occupy a royal suite instead of mopping floors where the whores track mud and crud past the bell hops!

Give me the thrill of a careless existence!
Give me the heat and the passion to win
I want the height and romance of adventure
Cool by the chill of the danger I'm in

They have us run to hail their cabs, while they're running up their tabs, drinking magnums of champagne

My life must be a house of cards
Getting higher and higher!



I'll step across an endless space
A daring walk on a wire!
Each day lived on fire!



Let me be free to be all that I could be

Some have, some have not!

Good morning! Grand Hotel front desk
This is Erik Ritenour, is that you, nurse?
What's happening at the hospital? How is my wife?
Oh, for God's sake, isn't the baby here yet?

Grand Hotel
At your service
Grand Hotel Berlin at your service
Grand Hotel

Grand Hotel
At your service. Grand hotel
At your service

Dangerous game, and a carefree existence
Only for those with the courage to play and the money to pay

Every bum and bitch
In old Berlin
Is rich except for us
Every bum and bitch
In old Berlin
Is rich except for us
Every bum and bitch
In old Berlin
Is rich except for us
Every bum and bitch
In old Berlin
Is rich except for us
Some have
Some have not
Some have
Some have not

Oh, for the thrill
Of a careless existence!
Live as I will
I want to live in love, and 
And pluck the fruit from the vine!
I want to 


Iâ€™d like to occupy a royal suite!
Instead of mopping floors
For the whores!

Every bum and bitch
In old Berlin
Is rich except for us
Every bum and bitch
In old Berlin
Is rich except for us
Every bum and bitch
In old Berlin
Is rich except for us
Every bum and bitch
In old Berlin
Is rich except for us
Every bum and bitch
In old Berlin
Is rich except for us
Every bum and bitch
In old Berlin
Is rich except for us
Every bum and bitch
In old Berlin
Is rich except for us
Every bum and bitch
In old Berlin
Is rich except for us
Some have!
Some have not!
Some have!
Some have not



It's the din of old Berlin
It's the din of old Berlin
It's the din
Of old Berlin
It's the din
Of old Berlin

Grand Hotel!
Grand Hotel!



It's the din of old Berlin! You're in the Grand HotelEmbed
