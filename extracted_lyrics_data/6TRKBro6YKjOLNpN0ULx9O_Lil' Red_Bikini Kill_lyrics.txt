8 ContributorsLil Red Lyrics
These are my tits, yeah
This is my ass
These are my legs, watch them walk fucking away
These are long nails to scratch out your eyes


You're not the victim
Though you like to make it that way
Pretty girls all gather 'round
To hear your side of things

Yeah, your side of things
Your sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-shining path

These are my ruby red lips
The better to suck you dry
These are my long red nails
The better to scratch out your eyes

I want it, baby
You might also like
You're not the victim
Though you like to make it that way
Pretty girls all gather 'round
To hear your side of things

I am sorry we are so
Nice to you

Here is my hand
Here is my hand
Here's my life
Why don't you take it?
Blah, blah, blah, all you ever do is

Take, take, take, take, take, take
Take, take, take, take, take, take
Take, take, take, take, take, take
Take, take, take, take, take, take, takeEmbed
