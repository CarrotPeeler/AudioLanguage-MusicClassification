20 ContributorsYou Lyrics
Wait

Uh-uh, end, all, it's you (You)
And at the end of it all, it's you (You, you)
And at the end, it's you (You, you, you)
At the end of it all, it's you (You, you)
It's you, it's you (You)
At the end of it all its you (You, you)
It's you, it's you (You, you, you)
At the end of it all (You, you)

Looking, from how I see it
When I finally realized, couldn't believe it
I couldn't even swallow
Had a lump in my throat, my stomach hollow
I had a notion that things were fishy
But everything was fine, so why be pissy?
But when you wasn't seeing me nights, you'd get it in
That's when the snooping and shit, it would begin
"Where you at? Where you goin'?"
That's what I get when I pick up the phone
Not a "Hello" or a "I miss you"
Or, "The Renaissance, how does it do?"
Suspicious ones, though few, can stress out your brain
It weighs on you, man, and helps you peep game
I thought it was me, but then, I could see it was you (You)
You might also like
It's you (You, you)
At the end of it all, it was you (You, you)
And at the end, it was you (You, you, you)
At the end of it all, it was you (You, you)
And at the end, it's you, it's you (You)
At the end of it all, it's you (You, you)
It's you, it's you (You, you, you)
At the end of it all (You, you)

I couldn't take it
But the spell of love, I couldn't shake it
Even though I would discover
That there was somebody else who was your lover
You gave me up, but managed to turn the tables
And all your honest words, they turned to fables
The things that you would accuse me of—
It seems, were the things you were doing, love
Get it? These things, you projected
And I don't want to be affected
But when you get in love, it's never easy, love
To make decisions of you've defected
You were doing so much to try to pin me
Going through all my stuff, but it was empty (Ugh)
Answers that I'm seeking
Well, it seems I'm getting close, that I'm reaching
And I was thinking I had no reason
Calling you a culprit, it was treason
And the twinkle in your eye
It was cunning, not for loving—tell me why?
We'll make amends if you admit it
We can ascend if you're committed
Your heart—is it in it?
If it goes too many days, sweet love can decay from you (You)
It's you (You, you)
At the end of it all, it was you (You, you)
And at the end, it was you (You, you, you)
At the end of it all, it was you (You, you)
And the end, it's you, it's you
At the end of it all, it's you (You, you)
It's you, It's you (You, you, you)
At the end of it all2Embed
