1 Contributor​kaleidoscope love Lyrics
Shawty are you new here, let me show you 'round
Walking, talking like you is the hottest in town
Take you to town, working it down, I run circles 'round ya
I run up, go pow pow, let's get to the subject
My camp's gnawing, I might flog a lil'
Toss it here, I'm cold like I'm from Montreal
Spark it 'til we catch flames, tweeting like a bird brain
Thinking that you know things, I'ma show you my ways

I’m crystallized, 'cause you're my
Kaleidoscope love
Kaleidoscope love
I’m crystallized, 'cause you're my
Kaleidoscope love
Kaleidoscope love
I’m crystallized, 'cause you're my
Kaleidoscope love
Kaleidoscope love

Skrt skrt, I'ma pull up on you like a box of Pampers
We could stay a weekend in the Hamptons
Hamper your vibe, I'm feeling old-school now
I'm talking that Moon River, I'm talking hoedown now
I'm talking that Etta James, I'm talking bed with a frame
I'll make you say my name, like you Beyoncé
Let's go one-on-one, mano a mano
Clock dripping like syrup, you know I move time slow
Chromatic, eyes look like rainbows
City backflipping angels, clothe light with the angles
Temptation I say no, sinner I stay low
His grace, I take hold
My view was monochromatic, I'm seeing colors now
I'm a dead man, but I still wanna love you down
Neu roses blooming from the garden
Pretty, pretty, sticky icky, don't start this
Set tripping in Cancun, I'm causing a monsoon
It's snowing in mid-June, and that's when I come to
Freudian slip, fish amok like a Cambodian kid
You might also like
I’m crystallized, 'cause you're my
Kaleidoscope love
Kaleidoscope love
I’m crystallized, 'cause you're my
Kaleidoscope love
Kaleidoscope love

You show me
Things in a different light
Things that were wrong go right
You and me making
Chemical equations
Deadly combinations
Dangerous situations
Running out in the magic of the night

Running out in the night, oh
Oh, in the night
Running out in the night
Running out in the night
Running out in the night, oh
Oh, in the night
Running out in the night, I'm
Colors, a view from another time
View from another world, kiss from another girl
Lips, I'm responsible, I just keep thinking 'bout the lady though
Running through my head, it drive me crazy though
But she ain't give me no second thought
On second thought, nothing lasts
So maybe I should leave her in the past
With my ex-girls, with my lost loves, with the back rubs
Je suis vraiment un triste garçon

I’m crystallized, 'cause you're my
Kaleidoscope love
Kaleidoscope love
I’m crystallized, 'cause you're my
Kaleidoscope love
Kaleidoscope love

Throwing myself pity parties on the daily, I'm not sorry
I'm just tired, I'm just 'bout as high up as a super starry
Supernova, run me over, 40 40 40, Hova
Jody, Jody, Jody Lawrance
I'ma see you in the morning
I'm the running man, I don't need to down a xan
I'm the running man, I don't need to down a xan
I don't need a Pharisee to tell me what I can't
I don't need a Pharisee to tell me what I can't
Put a prop on top ya head and watch you shoot the roof
Put a prop on top ya head and watch you shoot the roof
I don't wanna die alone, but I don't want you too
I don't wanna die alone, so I been making moves

I don't wanna die alone, so bury me in the ocean
My true home, made with an ancient potion
I'm a slave to the love I been trying to kill
This is real, my will really ain't made of steel
I lay in bed, in my head, trapped, all of that
Hurt bad, like I'm dead, I go for tit for tat
Thoughts swirling like a hurricane, I miss the past
But I'm dead to the world, so I'm not going back

I’m crystallized, 'cause you're my
Kaleidoscope love
Kaleidoscope love
I’m crystallized, 'cause you're my
Kaleidoscope love
Kaleidoscope love
I'm crystallized, 'cause you're myEmbed
