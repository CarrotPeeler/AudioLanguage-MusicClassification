When my love
Stands next to your love
I can't compare love
When it's not love

It's not love
It's not love
Which is my face
Which is a building
Which is on fire
On fire

When my love
Stands next to your love
I can't define love
When it's not love

It's not love
It's not love
Which is my face
Which is a building
Which is on fire

I've got two loves
I've got two loves
And they go tweet tweet tweet tweet tweet tweet tweet tweet tweet
Like little birds
They're my two loves
And they go tweet tweet tweet tweet tweet tweet tweet tweet tweet
Like little birds
They're my two loves

Count 'em one, two loves
Count 'em one, two loves
Which is my face
Which is a building
Which is on fire
On fire

When my love
Stands next to your love
I can't define love
When it's not love
Oh, it's not love
It's not love
Which is my face
Which is a building
Which is on fire1Embed
