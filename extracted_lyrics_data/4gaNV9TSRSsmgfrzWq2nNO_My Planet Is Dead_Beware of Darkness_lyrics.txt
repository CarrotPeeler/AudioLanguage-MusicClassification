1 ContributorMy Planet Is Dead LyricsHang them from the trees now that they tried to kill
Make them swallow oil now until their bodies turn still
Radiate their children so they might understand
This type of economics runs deeper than the bank
Oh well, well, well, my planet's dead
I taste the radiation on the tip of my tongue
See it in my children who are feral animals
Deformed like little monsters
They cannot walk or talk at all
If I tried to call them human
You would tell me I was wrong
Oh well, well, well, my planet's dead
Dead like my great grandmother
Dead like the middle class
Dead like the America dream
Dead like Whitman’s grass
So baby sleep while you can cos soon you’re gonna
Sleep in Hell
This man he thinks he’s god now
That life is his to take
Let him fall to the lions and let Mother Nature show her place
Or karma better act now, and humble this poor man
'Cause if not I'mma get to him and kill the
With my bare hands
