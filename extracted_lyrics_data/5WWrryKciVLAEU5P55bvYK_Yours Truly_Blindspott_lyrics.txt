And Empty Promises
Are all that they had for you
Trade flesh and bone
For dirt all shit you Composes
To this world we commit you
This is not goodbye
This is just a kiss before you die
This is not goodbye
Take my hand and close your eyes
Now hold on

This is just a kiss before you die
This is not goodbye
