4 ContributorsStepping Out Queen Lyrics
Put on your lipstick
Apply your makeup
Sometimes you'll be living, living in a dream
And then, and then, then you go steppin' out queen (Alright)

Well, you go to a party
And you laugh loud and hearty
And you stay all night long, girl you know you make the scene
And then you go steppin' out queen

Doo doo doo doo, doo doo doo doo, doo doo doo (Steppin' out)
Doo doo doo doo, doo doo doo doo, doo doo doo

It's just a windfall, just a windfall away
It keeps getting stronger every day (It's a love, a love, a love, a love)
Either you gotta look out and say
It's a windfall away

Doo doo doo doo, doo doo doo doo, doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo, doo doo doo doo, doo doo doo (Alright)

Ooh, it's just a windfall away
It's a love, it's a love, it's a love keeps getting stronger every day
(It's a love, a love, a love, a love)
And you gotta look up and say
It's a windfall away

Doo doo doo doo, doo doo doo doo, doo doo doo (It's a windfall)
Doo doo doo doo, doo doo doo doo, doo doo doo

Well, you go through the drama
And you work in the dharma
And you stand up, stand up and wipe, wipe your mirror clean
As you go steppin' out queen

Doo doo doo doo, doo doo doo doo, doo doo doo (Steppin' out)
Doo doo doo doo (Yeah), doo doo doo doo, doo doo doo (Right here)

Come in the garden and just look at the flowers (This is the windfall way)
We can just sit and talk for hours and hours
(It's a love, keeps getting stronger every day)
Come in the garden and just look at the flowers (It's a windfall way)
We can just sit and talk for hours and hours
(It's a love, it's a love, it's a love, it's a love, it's a love)
Come in the garden and just look at the flowers
(I'll come in your garden and then we'll go)
We can just sit and talk for hours and hours
(Steppin' out, steppin' out, steppin' out, steppin' out, steppin' out)
(Steppin' out, steppin' out, steppin' out, steppin' out, steppin' out)
Come in the garden (Steppin' out, steppin' out) and just look at the flowers
(Steppin' out, steppin' out, steppin' out, steppin' out, steppin' out)
(Steppin' out, steppin' out, steppin' out, steppin' out, steppin' out)
We can just sit and talk for hours and hours
(Steppin' out, steppin' out, steppin' out, steppin' out, steppin' out)
(Steppin' out, steppin' out, steppin' out, steppin' out, steppin' out)Embed
