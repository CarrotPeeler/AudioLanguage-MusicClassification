2 ContributorsIf Jesus Drove a Motor Home LyricsIf Jesus drove a motor home, I wonder would he drive
Pedal to the metal, or real slow? Checking out the stereo. Cassette playing Bob Dylan, motivation tapes
Tricked up Winnebago, with the tie-dye drapes
If Jesus drove a motor home (If Jesus drove a motor home)
If Jesus drove a motor home (If Jesus drove a motor home)
If Jesus drove a motor home, and he came to your town
Would you try to talk to him? Would you follow him around?
Honking horns at the drive thru. Double-parking at the mall. Midnight at the Waffle House - Jesus eating eggs with y'all
If Jesus drove a motor home (If Jesus drove a motor home)
If Jesus drove a motor home (If Jesus drove a motor home)
Buddha on a motorcycle, Mohammed in a train
Here come Jesus in the passing lane but everybody smile  'cause
Everybody's grooving
Ain't nothing like the feeling of moving with a bona fide motorized savior
Now if we all drove motor homes, well maybe in the end
With no country to die for, we could just be friends
One world as our highway. Ain't no yours or my way
We'd be cool wherever we roam, if Jesus drove a motor home
A motor home
(Motor home, motor home, motor home)
