2 ContributorsI Love LA Lyrics
Fresh out of my studio apartment in Primm
Right into my studio apartment in LA

Yo, I'm back in LA, I came here to visit
That was old shit and now I'm living
Word life, now follow me all the way through Laughlin
Of course I'm gon' be in LA 'til I drop my coffin
Yeah, until it's six-feet deep
Until husbands, bitches is crying, buying flowers for me, uh
I love LA like bitches like to love shoes
And also I love LA like BB King loved the blues
And also I love LA more than my lawyers are Jews
And they can help out and make sure the cops don't gather the clues
Now when Thor came out of Asgard, he dropped the hammer
But when I come out of Primm, I ain't afraid to pop blammers
But I don't have a gun 'cause why would I?
I'm just trying to live my life, my life, my life
Ducking shady bitches and posers tryna infiltrate
I got more girlies on my Lincoln than ElimiDate
Lincoln is my dick

LA, where the pretty people come to play
LA, LA, one day, Chank, you're gonna be famous
LA, where the pretty people come to play
LA, LA, one day, Chank, you're gonna be famous

You just heard what that bitch said? She ain't even my mother
She just a girl thatâ€“and also I met her today
Yo, and that's how the hook went
And we told her what to sing, but she says she believes it
Because there's obviously something about me
And there's obviously something that makes people not doubt me
Bitches wanna find me like there is a bounty
On my head, but there's not it's just me and I'm talented
So when I sift through my jackets, I find out which one I'm gonna wear
And then I put it on, yeah
Everybody like my swag
And if they don't, mm, what rhymes with swag?
Yeah, you know the word I can't say
But I would if I wasn't moving to Hollywood, haha
Yo, ayy, Green, leave that laugh in
It shows my personality and makes girls think I'm cute
Yo, I can't help it to you haters
You acting like I chose what mom to come out of
Yo, but check it out, I didn't
You dealt with what you dealt with and I'm just shittin'
All over these bitches in LA
Motherfuckers try to act like they know Chank
But they don't and even if they did
I'd "Hahahaha" all the way to the bank
LA, where the pretty people come to play
LA, LA, one day, Chank, you're gonna be famous
LA, where the pretty people come to play
LA, LA, one day, Chank, you're gonna be famous
