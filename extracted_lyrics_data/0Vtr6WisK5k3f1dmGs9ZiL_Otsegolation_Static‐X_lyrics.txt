If we gain by severance
We gain most of all
Annihilate your kindness
Twisting those involved

Scenes of revolution
Scenes of your destruction
We are desolation
We are isolation

Feel it coming again
Feel
Don't care at all
Feel it coming again
Feel

Feel it coming again
Feel
Don't care at all
Feel it coming again
Feel
