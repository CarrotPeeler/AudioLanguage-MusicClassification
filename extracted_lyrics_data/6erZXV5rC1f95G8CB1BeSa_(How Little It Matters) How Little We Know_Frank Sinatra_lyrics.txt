6 Contributors(How Little It Matters) How Little We Know LyricsHow little we know
How much to discover
What chemical forces flow
From lover to lover
How little we understand
What touches off that tingle
That sudden explosion
When two tingles intermingle
Who cares to define
What chemistry this is
Who cares with your lips on mine
How ignorant bliss is
So long as you kiss me
And the world around us shatters
How little it matters how little we know
How little we understand
What touches off that tingle
That sudden explosion
When two tingles intermingle
Who cares to define
What chemistry this is
Who cares with your lips on mine
How ignorant bliss is
You might also likeSo long as you kiss me
And the world around us shatters
How little it matters how little we know
How little we know
How little we knowEmbed
