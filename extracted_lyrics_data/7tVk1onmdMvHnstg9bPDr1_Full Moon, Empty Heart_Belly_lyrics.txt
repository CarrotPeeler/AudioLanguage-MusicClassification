Sleep in now, now
Sleep in now, now, now
It's still light out
Sleep in, now, now
Don't look at me looking back at you
Out the window backwards
Out the window backwards
Sleep

See this child twice stolen from me
Out the window backwards
Out the window backwards
Sleep in now, now
Sleep in now, now, now
Sleep now

Now fall to the bed
Put your hand in your hair
Now fall to the tile
Stick your finger in your eye
That's the only way you cry

Hey now, hey now
Full moon past the window sideways
Hey now, hey now
You might also like
Sleep in now, now (out the window backwards)
Sleep in now, now (out the window backwards)
Sleep in now, now (out the window)
Sleep, sleep, sleepEmbed
