I shoulda seen the sign way back then
When she told me that you were her best friend
And now she's rolling, rolling, rolling
And you were stolen, stolen, stolen
She started dressing like me and talking like me
It freaked me out
She started calling you up in the middle of the night
What's that about?

I just wanna be there when you discover
You wake up in the morning
Next to your new lover
She might cook you breakfast and love you in the shower
The flavor of the moment
'Cause she don't have what's ours

She's not me
She doesn't have my name
She'll never have what I have
It won't be the same (It won't be the same)

I shoulda seen the sign when you were here
Under a different light, it's all so clear
She was stealing, stealing, stealing
And now you're feeling, feeling, feeling
She started dyeing her hair and wearing the same perfume as me
She started reading my books and stealing my looks and lingerie
You might also like
I just wanna be there when you discover
You wake up in the morning
Next to your new lover
She might make you breakfast and love you in the shower
The thrill is momentary
'Cause she don't have what's ours

She's not me
She doesn't have my name
She'll never have what I have
It won't be the same (It won't be the same)

She is licking her lips and she's batting her eyes (She's not me)
She's got legs up to there and such beautiful hair (She's not me)
Oh, devoted for life, make a beautiful wife (She's not me)
If you spend some more time, I guarantee you will find (She's not me)
I know I can do it better

If someone wants to pimp your style
And hang with you a little while
And make up for the things you lack
You're gonna have to watch
She's not me
She doesn't have my name
She'll never have what I have
It won't be the same (It won't be the same)

Never let you forget
She's not me
She's not me and she never will be
Never let you forget
She's not me
She's not me and she never will be

Gotta find you a way to show your feelings
I guess that was some bullshit saying you love me, love me
Guess my expectation hit the ceiling
When you come back, it will cost, just trust me, trust me
Wendy

She's not me, she's not me
She's not me and she never will be
She's not me, she's not me
She's not me and she never will be
She never will be
Never will be, never will be, never will be, never will be, never will be
Never will be, never will be, never will be
Never will be, never will be, never will be
She's not me and she never will be
Never will be, never will be, never will be
She's not me
Never will be, never will be (Me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me)
(Me, me, me, me, me, me)
She's not me and she never will be, she never will be5Embed
