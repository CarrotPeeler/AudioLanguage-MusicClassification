Want you to know, go for your squeezin'
I want you to know, it really is pleasin'
Want you to know, I ain't for no teasin'

Treat me sweet and gentle
When you say goodnight
Just squeeze me
But please don't tease me

I get sentimental
When you hold me tight
Just squeeze me
But please don't tease me

Missing you since you went away
Singing the blues away each day
Counting the nights and waiting for you
I'm in the mood to let you know
I never knew I loved you so
Please say you love mе, too

When I get this feeling
I'm in ecstasy
So squeezе me
But please don't tease me
You might also like
Treat me, treat me sweet and gentle
When you, when you say goodnight
Just squeeze me
Baby, baby, baby, don't tease me

I get sentimental when you hold me tight
Just squeeze me
But please don't tease me

Missing you since you went away
Singing the blues away each day
Counting the nights and waiting for you
I'm in the mood to let you know
I never knew I loved you so
Please say you love me, too

When I get this feeling
I'm in ecstasy
So squeeze me
But please don't tease me

Squeeze me
But baby, baby, don't tease me
I can't stand to be teased
Don't tease me, tease me, baby, don't tease me
Squeeze me, squeeze me, squeeze me
Squeeze meEmbed
