Welcome to my world of steel
Master of my domain
Cower as the pain's unsealed
Disaster's where I'll reign

Father of sin
I'll drag you all in
Bow down as I petrify

Fire in the sky
Paralyzed with fear
You know you're gonna die
Dragonaut is near

Icon to the fall of man
Worshipped like a king
Fearless as I now condemn
Every living thing

Father of sin
I'll drag you all in
Bow down as I petrify

Fire in the sky
Paralyzed with fear
You know you're gonna die
Dragonaut is near

Father of sin
I'll drag you all in
Bow down as I petrify
Relish the blaze
Left all in a daze
He came and consumed and let fly

Fire in the sky
Paralyzed with fear
You know you're gonna die
Dragonaut is near
Fire in the sky
Paralyzed with fear
You know you're gonna die
Dragonaut is nearEmbed
