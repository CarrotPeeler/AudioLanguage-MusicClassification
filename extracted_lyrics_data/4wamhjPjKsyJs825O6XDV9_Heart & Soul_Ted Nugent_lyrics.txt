2 ContributorsHeart and Soul Lyrics
I'm alive with
This feeling
It ain't no mystery
Take you in my arms
All night long
I crave you
With a passion
You got the best of me
And if the truth be told
I can't let go

You're my heart and soul
Everything I wanted
Heart and soul
Everything I needed
{Verse 2}
Now you got me
Where you want me
I will go quietly
Each night lasts forever more
And your touch
Burns like fire
There ain't no turning back
You're taking me higher and higher
Will I survive this heart attack?
You might also like
Heart and soul
Everything I needed
You're my heart and soul
You gavе me everything I wantеd
You're my heart and soul!



Heart and soul
Everything I wanted
Heart and soul
Everything I needed
Heart and soul
Everything I wanted
Heart and soul
You gave me everything I needed!

Your touch burns me like fire, ah!
Higher and higher
And higher and higher!
You're my heart and soul!Embed
