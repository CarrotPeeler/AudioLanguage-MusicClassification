Distracts me from my ever changing
Tastefulness
My mouth upon the richest tongues
I run for this
Static at the same time by it all
Common sense
Can slap me in the face
And yet I condescend
Embarrassed by your obvious
Indifference
Disgusted at the same time by it all
Watching as my ego breaks your fall
Don't you know that I've
Been running from your heart
And I feel like you've been running too
Don't you know that I've
Been lying from the start
And I feel like you've been lying too
Leave you now
Can't convince myself
That you're the one somehow
To free me from this smile
I call my loneliness
Stuck inside this need to feel complete
Now I've left you standing on your feet
You might also likeDon't you know that I've
Been running from your heart
And I feel like you've been running too
Don't you know that I've
Been lying from the start
And I feel like you've been lying too
Faithfulness is just a little rule
We break
Still pretending lust was just a fool
We faked, me made
Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah......
Don't you know that I've
Been running from your heart
And I feel like you've been running too
Don't you know that I've
Been lying from the start
And I feel like you've been lying too
Don't you know that I've
Been running from your heart
And I feel like you've been running too
Don't you know that I've
Been lying from the start
And I feel like you've been lying too
Don't you know that I've
Been running from your heart
And I feel like you've been running too
Don't you know that I've
Been lying from the start
And I feel like you've been lying tooEmbed
