1 ContributorWash It All Away (Cleansed Dub) LyricsWashed away I can’t fight this no more
I can’t fight you no more
Just leave me to die now
I can’t fight you no more
Washed away tears
Washed away fears
Washed away face
Still miss you
Still miss you
I can’t fight this no more
I can’t fight you
Just leave me to die now
I can’t fight this no more
I can’t fight you no more
Just leave me to die now
Washed away tears
Washed away fears
Washed away your face
Still miss you
Still miss youYou might also likeEmbed
