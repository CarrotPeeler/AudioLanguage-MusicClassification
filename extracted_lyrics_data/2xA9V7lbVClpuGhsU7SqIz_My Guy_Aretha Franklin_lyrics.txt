Nothing you could say could tear me away from my guy
And nothing you could do 'cause I'm stuck like glue to my guy
I'm sticking to my guy like a stamp to a letter
Like birds of a feather we just stick together
I'm telling you from the start I can't be torn apart from my guy

Nothing you could do could make me untrue to my guy
(My guy)
And nothing you could buy could make me tell a lie to my guy
(My guy, my guy, my guy)
I gave my guy my word of honor
To be faithful, and I'm gonna
You best be believing I won't be deceiving my guy

As a matter of opinion, I think he's tops
My opinion is he's the cream of the crop
As a matter of taste to be exact
He's my ideal as a matter of fact

And no muscle-bound man could ever take my hand from my guy
(My guy)
And no handsome face could ever take the place of my guy
(My guy, my guy, my guy)
He may not be a movie star
But when it comes to being happy, we are
There's not a man today who could take me away from my guy
You might also like
And no muscle-bound man could ever take my hand from my guy
(My guy)
And no handsome face could ever take the place of my guy
(My guy, my guy, my guy)
He may not be a movie star
But when it comes to being happy, we are
There's not a man today who could take me away from my guy
(What you say?)
There's not a man today who could even take me away from my guy
(Tell me more)
There's not a man today who could even take me away from my guy
(What you say?)
Not a man today who could take me away from my guy1Embed
