1 ContributorToo Young to Say Goodbye LyricsTake me down to the far side of these tracks
Where uncle's playin' B-sides to the card game with all the wild jacks
See, I'm just playin' for a ticket to get through
To catch whatever, forget all about you
Shut all the doors to the dawn
And you'll be all alone
We're much too young to say goodbye
But I won't waste another day here by your side
When it comes to love, you don't have a clue
You don't have a heart, but you could easily break mine
It's time to say goodbye
My bride in black's got a thing for the pusherman
It must be love, but they sure ain't pretty when they're holding hands
I got the memories and you've got a whole world to annoy
And just like Eddie Giles, I'm a losin' boy
Shut all the doors to the dawn
And you'll be all alone
We're much too young to say goodbye
But I won't waste another day here by your side
When it comes to love, you don't have a clue
You don't have a heart, but you could easily break mine
It's time to say goodbye
You might also likeAnd she's always livin' in my pen
Oh, lord I've tried to forget your number
But I just won't bleed for her again
My love for you is getting so much dumber
She is not someone I'd recommend
If this is the end of the road I might apologize
I love to hate that I love you and it's time to say goodbye
We're much too young to say goodbye
But I won't waste another day here by your side
When it comes to love
You don't have a clue, you don't have a heart
But you could easily break mine
It's time to say goodbyeEmbed
