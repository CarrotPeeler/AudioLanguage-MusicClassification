1 ContributorWelcome the Bright Skies LyricsInto the night, waits the dawning sun
The warmth of light creates a new world to come
Life is straining now to overcome the void
And to embrace the joy
The cold abates to the rise of spring
The air of hope arrives, and birds wake to sing
Life will never wait
We live on borrowed time, embrace your fate
Take in the morning light
And live the days of sun in endless flight
We all just want to make our mark
To survive the coming dark
Eden falls into grief
And we all look on in disbelief
In the end the world will fall, if we won't care
The threads of time erase our lives, no more to spare
A turning, changing world
The ribbon of time unfurled
Can we abide passively
Waiting our time, we are standing by
We all just want to keep our place
To keep running in this race
Facing time and despair
No room for resurrection
Through the flood and the storm
Beyond the gloom, a light will transform
You might also likeFor you must outlast the fire
And rise up higher
Over smoke
Above the pain
Of winter wind
We are the rain
It's hard to always run away
From ice and snow, the bitter gray
We rise up and we fall
The storm holds sway over us and all
But then breaks the fiery dawn over winter eyes
The darkness decaying, welcome the bright skies
Life will never wait
We live on borrowed time, open the gate
Take in the morning light
And let go the nightEmbed
