5 ContributorsLooking for Love LyricsI was alone thinkin' I was just fine
I wasn't lookin' for anyone to be mine
I thought love was just a fabrication
A train that wouldn't stop at my station
Home, alone, that was my consignment
Solitary confinement
So when we met I was skirting around you
I didn't know I was looking for love until I found you
I didn't know I was looking for love until I found you
I didn't know I was looking for love until I found you
I didn't know I was looking for love
I didn't know I was looking for love
'Cause there you stood and I would
Oh, I wonder could I say how I felt
And not be misunderstood
A thousand stars came into my system
I never knew how much I had missed them
Slap on the map of my heart you landed
I was coy but you made me candid
And now the planets circle around you
I didn't know I was looking for love until I found you
I didn't know I was looking for love until I found you, baby
I didn't know I was looking for love until I found you
I didn't know I was looking for love
I didn't know I was looking for love

In a world of tears, one consolation
And now you're here there's a full brass band
Playing in me like a wonderland
And if you left I would be two foot small
And every tear would be a waterfall
Soundless boundless I'll surround you
I didn't know I was looking for love until I found you
I just didn't know
I didn't know I was looking for love until I found you
I didn't know I was looking for love until I found you, baby
I didn't know I was looking for love
I didn't know I was looking for love
I just didn't know
I didn't know I was looking for love until I found you
I didn't know I was looking for love until I found you, baby
I didn't know I was looking for love
I didn't know I was looking for love until I found youEmbed
