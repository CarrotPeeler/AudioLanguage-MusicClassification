Aw
Baby, baby, baby, baby
Love is here
Move real slow
Stay right here
Don't want to let you go
Sweet touch of love
Girl you're all I need
Take me in your arms
And love me

Ohhh
You know how to make me feel so good
And ohhhh
You know to make me feel so good

The sweetest love
Baby I ever had
It feels so good
To be loved so bad
I can taste each kiss
I long for each caress
I'm on you now
And nothing less
You might also like

(This feeling)
Feeling like it's right tonight
(The satisfaction)
Has sparked a chain reaction
I'm gonna explode
(Give it to me, live it with  me
Lay with me, stay with me)
I wanna make it with you
My soul's on fire
And you're the one that I desireEmbed
