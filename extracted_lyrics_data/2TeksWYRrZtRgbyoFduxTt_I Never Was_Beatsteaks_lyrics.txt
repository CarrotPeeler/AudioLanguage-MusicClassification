2 ContributorsI Never Was Lyrics

I never was an astronaut
I never was a plumber
I never was a Beastie Boy
And it doesn't really matter
If there's a resurrection
I don't need to be saved
And if we meet in heaven
I'd love to see the place

Blame it on biology
What am I supposed to be? (Hey!)

Whoa-oa-oa-oh-oa

Yeah
I never was an acrobat
I'll always be a dancer
The questions rain like cannonballs
Wish I had all the answers
Uh-uh

Here it comes, let it grow
Here it comes, let it grow

Blame it on biology
What am I supposed to be?

Here it comes, let it grow
I never was an astronaut
I wish I was a drummer (Hey!)

Whoa-oa-oa-oh-oa
Whoa-oa-oa-oh-oa-oh-oa
Whoa-oa-oa-oh-oa
Whoa-oa-oa-oh-oa-oh-oa, yeah

Blame it on biology
What am I supposed to be?
