3 ContributorsThe Reflection Lyrics
She was a little girl
And I was only just learning to crawl
I would call her name
To see her beautiful eyes glow
Oh, look at me
Oh, look at me

They tell you to hold on
And say that, one day, you'll understand
Well, I'm still waiting
Yeah, I'm still here

I want something more
Something kind
Something pure

Oh, she was a little jonesy
Oh, I should know
And he was little backwards man
With nothing much to show

And everything she said
Would leave me cold
And everything he did
Leads to nowhere
It all amounts to this...
(It all amounts to this)
You might also like
All this time
I never knew
Who you really were


We pass it down
It keeps repeating
We break and run
We keep deceiving

I am becoming (I am become)
I am becoming (I am the one)
I am reflection (I am the sun)
I am the shadow (I am the gun)

I want something more
Something kind
Something pure
