2 ContributorsLocal Resident Failure LyricsBlack it out
Like a war-torn city
Black it out
I still deny
I will decide
I will deny
Positively charged most of the time
Take a breath and toe the line
I never want to fill this space
Block it out
When the bright light's hurting
Block it out
Still pretend
It all depends
I will pretend
That nothing went wrong along the way
No regrets
I hear me say
Looking up from both sides now
I still feel the same
I don't feel the same
Next stop alternative failure
Today isn't turning out that good
Feel like the local resident failure
But I still feel misunderstood
Cut it out
Round the headlines flashing
Cut it out
I'm allowed
Unique mistakes
Yeah, I'm allowed
Drive me away to a better place
Start to believe that I'm a stupid waste
Time moves quicker in my wake
I still feel the same, no I don't feel the same
Next stop, alternative failure
Today isn't turning out that good
Feel like the local resident failure
And I still feel misunderstood
Flat knocked down in a city street
Machine won't let me go to sleep
It's obvious today is not my day
Must have offended someone before
Six men kicking through my door
Apparently today is not my day
Black it out, black it out
Still pretend, I will pretend
That nothing went wrong along the way
No regrets I hear me say
Looking up from both sides now
I don't feel the, I still feel the same
Chemicals spilt in the bathroom sink
Another cockroach in my drink
Apparently today is not my day
Clearly now today is not my dayYou might also likeEmbed
