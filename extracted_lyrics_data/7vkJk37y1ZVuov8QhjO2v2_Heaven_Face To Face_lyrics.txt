Is the whole of the heart
And Heaven
Don't tear you apart
Yeah Heaven
Is the whole of the heart
And Heaven
Don't tear you apart
There's too many kings wanna hold you down
And a world at the window gone underground
There's a hole in the sky where the sun don't shine
And a clock on the wall and it counts my time
And Heaven
Is the whole of the heart
And Heaven
Don't tear you apart
Yeah heaven is the whole of the heart
And Heaven
Don't tear you apart
There's a song on the air with a love-you-line
And a face in a glass and it looks like mine
And i'm standing on ice when I say that I don't hear planes
And I scream at the fools wanna jump my train

Yeah Heaven
Is the whole of the heart
And Heaven
Don't tear you apart
Yeah Heaven
