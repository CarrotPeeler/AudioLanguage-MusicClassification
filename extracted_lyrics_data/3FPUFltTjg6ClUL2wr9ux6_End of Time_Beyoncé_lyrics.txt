Come take my hand, I won't let you go
I'll be your friend, I will love you so deeply
I will be the one to kiss you at night
I will love you until the end of time
I'ma be your baby (Hey), I'll promise not to let you go (Oh)
Love you like crazy (Now), now say you'll never let me go (Hey)
Say you'll never let me go (Hey)
Say, say you'll never let me go (Hey)
Say you'll never let me go (Hey)
Say, say you'll never let me go

Take you away from here
There's nothing between us but space and time
I'll be your own little star, let me shine in your world
In your own little universe, make me your girl

Come take my hand (Take my hand)
I won't let you go (Won't let you go)
I'll be your friend, I will love you so deeply
I will be the one to kiss you at night (Kiss you at night)
I will love you until the end of time
I'ma be your baby (Hey), I'll promise not to let you go (Oh)
Love you like crazy (Now), now say you'll never let me go (Ha)
Say you'll never let me go (Hey)
Say, say you'll never let me go (Hey)
Say you'll never let me go (Hey)
Say, say you'll never let me go

Baby, come on, get up on it
Show me that you really want it
I wanna be the one to love you, baby, let's go (Oh)

I ain't frontin' in this love
But can you let me love you from your head to toe? (Oh)
Baby, let's go (Oh)

Boy, come to me (Come to me)
Let me turn your rain into sun (Come to me, baby)
You don't have to worry, baby (Oh, no)
I promise I'll set your heart free
Let my love into your soul
You go, I go, we go
