And try and taste the day
Don't even think of looking back
We press on again
Don't let me die just yet
I've only woken up
There's so much to do
There's so little done
You see the sun in everyone
Sometimes I wish I could
Not blindly hope through helplessness
And ever dwindling truth
Don't let me die just yet
I've only woken up
There's so much to do
There's so little done
Don't let me die just yet
I've only woken up
There's so much to do
There's so little doneYou might also likeEmbed
