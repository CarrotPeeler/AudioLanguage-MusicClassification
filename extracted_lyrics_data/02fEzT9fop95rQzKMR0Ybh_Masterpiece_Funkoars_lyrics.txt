(Funkoars)
 Drunkoars in the building
While the rest of these motherfuckers are on some
We are the world, shit, haha, ayy

They don’t want bad blood between us
Like two girls either side, tryna fight for the rights to ride 
We Certified, wise vagabonds
Roam through deserted crates to find breaks to try rappin' on
They babblin' bullshit like, "We raisin' the bar"
 we takin' the bar to break it in half, scrapin' the spark
With the fuse lit, making a mark, bottle'll make it's mark
And loops like dogs chasing their arse
I got a tax cheque for two G's, got some diamonds and gold
Went on a bender for two weeks, lost my diamonds and gold
Tryna hold a steady job, get a career
I got better luck  breaking  getting it cleared
Yeah, scene hoppers that wanna drop into rap
Usually get  and 
 it ain’t the haters making the music
It’s the music making the haters try to do it, you knew it

And if you didn’t know it, now you know my friends
Drunkoars are for the babies
Yeah, it’s like this, like that
You might also like
Baby, you got a masterpiece, yeah, yeah-yeah
Baby-baby, you got a masterpiece, yeah, yeah-yeah
Baby-baby, you got a masterpiece, masterpiece, masterpiece
And it means the world to me

Yeah, ayy, ayy, yeah
My last shit was the next shit
Next shit’ll be the best shit, Ses expect to exit
The game with a claim to shame, blame the fame
For the reason women need a breather when they hear the name
(Oh) But they screw up their face when I meet 'em
I'm in wife beaters for a reason and rocking Adidas (Yeah)
See me at my peak when I drink hard (Yeah, happy hour's at six)
Well, see me on the floor by six past (Yeah)
The Funkoars invented that raw embedded with porn
Never met a competitor, means I met ‘em all
Forget it, we the owners
How’s a bitch in a minute even seeing the man of the moment?
A lot of rappers are singing to sell
I just drop a lot of good shit like I’m eating well, you see your girl
Meet a girl, fill her cup, then skeet a girl
 girl, pass her up 

Baby, you got a masterpiece, yeah, yeah-yeah
Baby-baby, you got a masterpiece, yeah, yeah-yeah
Baby-baby, you got a masterpiece, masterpiece, masterpiece
And it means the world to me
Now, this verse a masterpiece, even before I start to speak
Like a split personality, you don’t know the half of me
 Skilled in the art started beef
Drink at bars till doors close like the passage through my arteries
 spark the weed, neck a bottle like a hickey
Given this is my town and I’ma push it past the city limits
Funkoars, we the best, no doubt
I’m raw like the sex with a chick I'll hit if she been checked out
And don’t wanna track  my hot hits a crowd
Not a moshpit and groupies mouths waitin' 
Yeah, we back with another hit record
But we never make the big time like Flava Flav’s pendent
Turn my mic up, my Drunkoars at the bar
Raise your cups if you drinking till the night’s up
Your step daddy’s back and still make a whore moan
We still got that raw flow, so welcome to the ‘Oars show

Baby, you got a masterpiece, yeah, yeah-yeah
Baby-baby, you got a masterpiece, yeah, yeah-yeah
Baby-baby, you got a masterpiece, masterpiece, masterpiece
And it means the world to meEmbed
