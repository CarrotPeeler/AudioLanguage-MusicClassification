3 ContributorsWitch Lyrics
Like kids fishing for my spine
Fake love, palm trees and cheap wine
French kiss, pavement like you know
How one heals and how one grows

Get out, get out, get out, get out of my mind
Get out, get out, get out, get out of my life

The light of the midnight sun
Will bring sharks and all their fun
Alright, outside breaks to find
Bright lights, truth, and stolen time

Get out, get out, get out, get out of my mind
Get out, get out, get out, get out of my life

Get out, get out, get out, get out of my mind
Get out, get out, get out, get out of my life

Ooh, I know you did it
Ooh, just admit it and go back where you came
Ooh, I know you did it
Ooh, just admit it and go back where you came
You might also like
Get out, get out, get out, get out of my mind
Get out, get out, get out, get out of my life

Get out, get out, get out, get out of my mind
Get out, get out, get out, get out of my life

Ooh, I know you did it
Ooh, just admit it and go back where you came
Ooh, I know you did it
Ooh, just admit it and go back where you cameEmbed
