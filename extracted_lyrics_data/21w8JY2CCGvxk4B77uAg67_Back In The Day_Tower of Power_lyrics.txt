2 ContributorsTrue Vision Lyrics
They're saying that he insane, crazy, mind stands aiming
I wonder who out there, the people gotta name me
Lazy for a couple years, drowning in beers
Picked up where I left off for head on my peers
It seems I got styles, personality seems
Boss type, light pep,  jeans
I seen the whole rap game, sipping on lean
But be the tension when it's mentioned, 
He a five star general, analogue or digital
Avant-garde, plus boom bap and minimal
All things to those that plays original
Throw bottles at the idols of the one dimension
Come forth, Gather round and hear me speak
 rhymes and the stones, we're for the people that ink
Got sent back to the bottom when I reached my peek
With the riddle I was given at the foot of the sphinx
The rhyme - I construct one brick at the time
It's impossible to top when you put out of line
I hit the underground harder than a harder event
Rappers fall like the third tower planes never hit, shit

This ain't your everyday rap, I got a true vision
I do this for myself, man, I'm a musician
Say yeah if you're feeling it (feeling it)
Raise your hands if you feeling it (feeling it)
This ain't your everyday rap, I got a true vision
I do this for myself, man, I'm a musician
Say yeah if you're feeling it (feeling it)
Raise your hands if you feeling it (feeling it)

They wanna know if Print's real, well, I can't stay
I'm too hard to find, my crib is the back cave
The block where they got sprayed, under covers masquerade
It used to be worst back in the day
Mean Bean got locked up and passed away
You can take life and run, or you can sneak in the back way
 is the rap where soul is half away
Moving at the speed of light, switching to the fast lane
24 boss and 48 loss of power
Every time I rhyme my street buzz gets louder
I'm  inhaling lines, I'm gun powder
Running down our streets, chasing down cowards
Cops go out of their way to send me subliminals
Cause they're working 9 to 5 for a wave just minimal
But I'mma keep it cool and still smile in their face
Till they master up enough heart to call me my name
Busy rhyming for your mens, I rhyme for the fans
Just more in , I got too much charm on their hands
If I'm really as small as they say that I am
Then way would distancing me be a way of advance?
Please, you know my  rolling on MTV
Probably rocking dirty jeans with a whole in me
I woke up in the spot, with all dollar looking dummie
And walk out with something soft, plus three numbers
Whether making songs, making out or making cream
You better know that throw backs the only you'll make the team
Slang weed, or slang CDs it's all the same in me
Cause I'm compelled to the same degree without a fight
You can take a fang from me
I earned my spot, nobody ever gave it to me
So don't play with me
Because you gotta be a  that gained fame for me
This ain't your everyday rap, I got a true vision
I do this for myself, man, I'm a musician
Say yeah if you're feeling it (feeling it)
Raise your hands if you feeling it (feeling it)
This ain't your everyday rap, I got a true vision
I do this for myself, man, I'm a musician
Say yeah if you're feeling it (feeling it)
Raise your hands if you feeling it (feeling it)Embed
