She's got shaking hips
She's got flashing eyes that hypnotize
Ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah
Baby that's nice
She's got a clinging dress
But she never says yes
I must have mistook that sexy look
Ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah
Baby that's nice
She is a teaser, she is a teaser
And she says if you want me
Come and get me, come on
Come and get me if you want me
Come on
If you want me come and get me
Come on, come on
If you want me come and get me
Come on, come on
Come and get me if you want me
Come on, come on
If you want me come and get me
Come on, come on, come on

Come on, come on
Come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on
She makes you sit up and beg
When she flashes her legs
She lets it get quiet
Then starts up a riot
Ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah
Baby that's nice
You know she moves like a snake
But she's just a big fake
She starts to unwind
Then you're losing your mind
Ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah
Baby that's nice
She is a teaser, she is a teaser
And she says if you want me
Come and get me, come on
Come and get me if you want me
Come on
If you want me come and get me
Come on, come on
If you want me come and get me
Come on, come on
Come and get me if you want me
Come on, come on
If you want me come and get me
Come on, come on
Come on, come on
Come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on
