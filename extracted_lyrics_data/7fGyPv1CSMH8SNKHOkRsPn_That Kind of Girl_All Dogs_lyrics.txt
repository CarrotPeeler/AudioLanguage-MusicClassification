3 ContributorsThat Kind of Girl LyricsAnd I know that I am always fucking up your world
You are better off not messing with that kind of girl

What does that mean
When they say
Stay away from me?
What’s that mean?

If you’re wanting something else
Then that’s all you have to say
Clear water, love, and health
Then that’s all you have to say
Not to hear my voice on the phone saying that I’m not okay
I am underneath the water
Kicking every day

What’s that mean?
Stay away from me
What’s that mean?
Stay away

If you’re wanting something else
Then I hope you find it
Clear water, love, and health
Then I hope you find it
I don’t wanna be the weight upon your shoulders when you wake
I don’t wanna drag you under
Kicking every day
You might also like
What’s that mean?
Stay away from me
What’s that mean?
Stay away
What’s that mean?
Stay away from me
What’s that mean?Embed
