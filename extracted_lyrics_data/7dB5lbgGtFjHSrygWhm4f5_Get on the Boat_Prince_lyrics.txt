Ow!

Look outside your window
Tell me now what you see
Coming up the mountain
For a new philosophy
Every single color
Every race and every creed
Looking for the truth, y'all
That's going to set somebody free

Get on the boat
Get on the boat, people
Get on the boat now
We got room for a hundred more
Get on the boat
Get on the boat, people
Get on the boat now
We got room for a hundred more

All across the nation
People doing what they can
To avoid the tribulation
That will be great throughout the land
You might also likeEverything in darkness
Must come out into the light (That’s right)
When we love each other
That's the only way it's gonna be right

(Hey) Get on the boat
Get on the boat, people
Get on the boat now
We got room for a hundred more
Get on the boat (Oh yeah)
Get on the boat, people
Get on the boat now
Oo, we got room for a hundred more
Good God

Say it again
Bridge

We were meant to live together
Underneath the sun
I can't think of nothing better
Don't you wanna come?
Get on the boat
Never mind what time it is
The party's just begun
No te alejes de este momento de inspiracion
You can let your hair down
Let the music move your feet
Panamama bring the drama
Dancing to the beat
Maceo


What's the harm in listening to the hopeful words we say?
If it moves your heart, you know you better get in without delay

Get on the boat
Get on the boat, people
Get on the boat now
We got room for a hundred more


Dance to the beat
Ray, Ray, Ray

Lead line: horns, hit me now

Get on the boat
Get on the boat, people
Get on the boat now
We got room for a hundred more
Get on the boat
Get on the boat, people
Get on the boat now
We got room for a hundred more

We were meant to live together
Underneath the sun
I can't think of nothing better
Don't you want to come?
Get on the boat
Oh yeah

Get on the boat (Get on)
Get on the boat, people (C'mon, c'mon)
Get on the boat now (Ohh)
We got room for a hundred more
Get on the boat (Every color)
Get on the boat, people (Every creed)
Get on the boat now (C'mon, c'mon)
We got room for a hundred more (Come with me)
Get on the boat (Ow Ooooah)
Get on the boat, people
Get on the boat now
We got room for a hundred more
Get on the boat
Get on the boat, people
Get on the boat now
We got room for a hundred more

Hah! We’re gone!
Lead line!  Woo!
Can’t stand it
Keep it going, keep it going

Y’all get on the boat
C’mon
Get on the boat
C’monEmbed
