2 ContributorsNight of the Sin LyricsSky was red but stars were shining
She felt someone's breath behind her
There was something mysterious in the air
Specters, phantoms were around her
She saw it once in one of her dreams
She knew she was the one
They will take her there
There was no escape
It's her destiny
No, she won't hide
Tonight, it is the night of the sin!
Black sabbat at midnight
Now she's one of them
Black sabbat at midnight
She rule the flames
Black sabbat at midnight
Was so real and wild
Black sabbat at midnight
She is the witch, she's the one
Phantoms were playing on the bones
Witches were dancing with grey ghosts
There were a hundreds of human skulls around

She will wait for the next midnight
When she will b called by the howl of hell's hound!
There was no escape
It's her destiny
No, she won't hide
Tonight, it is the night of the sin!
Black sabbat at midnight
Now she's one of them
Black sabbat at midnight
She rule the flames
Black sabbat at midnight
Was so real and wild
Black sabbat at midnight
She is the witch, she's the oneEmbed
