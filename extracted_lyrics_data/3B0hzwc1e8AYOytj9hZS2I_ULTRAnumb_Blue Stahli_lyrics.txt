(U-U-ULTRAnumb)
(Three!)
(Two! One!)
You want it all right now! (ULTRAnumb)
Right now! Three! Two! One! (ULTRAnumb)
One!
One!

(Three, two, one, you want it full frontal, overstimulation)
So say a benediction for a new addiction in voyeuristic overdrive (here comes the countdown!)

(Three!) This is the new flesh,  (two!) this is the open door
(One!) We've got everything you wanted
You want it all right now! (ULTRAnumb)
Right now! (Three! Two! One!)

Violated, so degraded
The show has just begun (Three! Two! One!)
Dominated, by all you hated
This will make you ULTRAnumb (Three! Two! One!)

(Three, two, one, reality's a plague, we're the medication)
A new manipulation, oversaturation, take advantage of what you deny (here comes the countdown!)
You might also like
(Three!) So step right up and see (Two!) the possibilities
(One!) We are everything you wanted
You want it all right now! (ULTRAnumb)
Right now! (Three! Two! One!)

Violated, so degraded
The show has just begun (Three! Two! One!)
Dominated, by all you hated
This will make you ULTRAnumb (Three! Two! One!)

One confession (Confession)
Is such perfection (Perfection)
Your sweet repression (Repression)
Can't hide who you really are

Say you love it, say you hate it, doesn't matter 'cause you're all the same
Say you want it, say you need it, come and get it 'cause we love the shame
Say you love it, say you hate it, just another one to suck the fame
Don't pretend that you're better than this, malevolence goes both ways

(Three! Two! One!) (U-U-ULTRAnumb)
(One!)
(Three! Two! One!)

Violated, so degraded
The show has just begun (Three! Two! One!)
Dominated, by all you hated
This will make you ULTRAnumb (Three! Two! One!)
Violated, so degraded
The show has just begun (Three! Two! One!)
Dominated, by all you hated
This will make you ULTRAnumb3Embed
