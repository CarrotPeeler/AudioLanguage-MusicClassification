5 ContributorsTurn to White LyricsI took a picture
Your form was cloudy in the night
You wrote a letter
You said you tried to shed some light
On the good and the wicked things we do
Face my direction
I want to see you better, dear
You're a distraction
From everything that I fear
And the good and the wicked things I do
Sometimes, oh, sometimes
I think I could fade away
In the light, oh, the light
Of an ever sunny day
But I'm stronger than the picture that you took before you left
In the light, it faded to white
In the light, the colors turn to white
Indian summer
I caught a glimpse of things to come
Racing to finish
I never think before I run
To the good and the wicked things you do
You might also likeSometimes, oh, sometimes
I think I could fade away
In the light, oh, the light
Of an ever sunny day
But I'm stronger than the picture that you took before you left
In the light, it faded to white
In the light, the colors turn to whiteEmbed
