1 ContributorJumper hanging out on the line LyricsSee my jumper on
Hangin' out on the line
Know by that
Something on my mind
I wouldn't be here, baby
If it hadn't been for you
Way down here, way you wanna do
Fix my supper, baby, let me go to bed
Guess white lightnin'
Done gone to my head
Guess white lightnin'
Done gone to my headYou might also likeEmbed
