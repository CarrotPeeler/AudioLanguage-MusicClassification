2 ContributorsJunco Partner Lyrics
Oh down the road come poor little junco
Boys he was loaded as he could be
The poor man was knocked out, knocked out and loaded
And he was wobbling all over the street

I heard him singing six months ainâ€²t no sentence
He said one year was not no time
He said he had friends still in Angola
Serving from fourteen to ninety nine

You know when he had plenty of money
He had a friend all over town
Since he been broke, scraggly and hungry
Not a single friend can be found

Well the poor man pawned his watch and pistol
Oh he pawned his diamond ring
He tried to pawn the woman he was loving
But the poor girl couldn't sign her name

She said give him water when he get thirsty
Tell him that water is mighty fine when you're dry
Give him a tincture when he gets sickly
Give him the graveyard then if, if he dies
You might also like
Oh down the road come poor little junco
Boys he was loaded as he could be
The poor man was knocked out, knocked out and loaded
And he was wobbling all over the street

Well the poor man sung six months ain't no sentence
One year was not no time
Said he had friends still in Angola
Serving from fourteen to ninety nine

Well, he pawned his watch and pistol
Yes he pawned his diamond ring
He tried to pawn the woman he was loving
But the poor girl couldn't sign her name

She said give him water when he get thirsty
Tell him that water is mighty fine when you're dry
Give him a tincture when he gets sickly
Give him the graveyard in case he dies

Give him the graveyard then if he dies
Give him the graveyard in case he diesEmbed
