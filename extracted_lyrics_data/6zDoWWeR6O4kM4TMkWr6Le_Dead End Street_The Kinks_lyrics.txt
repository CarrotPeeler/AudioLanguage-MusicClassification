6 ContributorsDead End Street Lyrics
There's a crack up in the ceiling
And the kitchen sink is leaking
Out of work and got no money
A Sunday joint of bread and honey

What are we living for?
Two-roomed apartment on the second floor
No money coming in
The rent collector's knocking, trying to get in
We are strictly second class
And we don't understand

(Dead end!) Why we should be on dead end street?
(Dead end!) People are living on dead end street
(Dead end!) I'm gonna die on dead end street

Dead end street (Yeah!)
Dead end street (Yeah!)

On a cold and frosty morning
Wipe my eyes and stop me yawning
And my feet are nearly frozen
Boil the tea and put some toast on
You might also like
What are we living for?
Two-roomed apartment on the second floor
No chance to emigrate
I'm deep in debt and now it's much too late
We both want to work so hard
We can't get the chance

(Dead end!) People live on dead end street
(Dead end!) People are dying on dead end street
(Dead end!) I'm gonna die on dead end street

Dead end street (Yeah!)
Dead end street (Yeah!)

(Dead end!) People live on dead end street
(Dead end!) People are dying on dead end street
(Dead end!) I'm gonna die on dead end street

Dead end street (Yeah!)
Dead end street (Yeah!)
Dead end street (Yeah!)
Head to my feet (Yeah!)
Dead end street (Yeah)
Dead end street (Yeah)
Dead end street (Yeah)
How's it feel? (Yeah)
How's it feel? (Yeah)
Dead end street (Yeah)
