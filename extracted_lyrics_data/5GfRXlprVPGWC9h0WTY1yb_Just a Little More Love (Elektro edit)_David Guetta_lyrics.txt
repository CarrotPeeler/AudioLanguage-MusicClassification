5 ContributorsJust a Little More Love (Elektro Edit) LyricsJust a little more love, just a little more peace
It's all it takes to live a dream
We're walking hand in hand, you've got to understand
And one day soon, we'll live in harmony
Just a little more love, just a little more peace
It's all it takes to live a dream
We're walking hand in hand, you've got to understand
And one day soon, we'll live in harmony
Just a little more love, just a little more peace
It's all it takes to live a dream
We're walking hand in hand, you've got to understand
And one day soon, we'll live in harmony
Just a little more love, just a little more peace
It's all it takes to live a dream
We're walking hand in hand, you've got to understand
And one day soon, we'll live in harmony
Just a little more love, just a little more peace
It's all it takes to live a dream
We're walking hand in hand, you've got to understand
And one day soon, we'll live in harmony
Just a little more love, just a little more peace
It's all it takes to live a dream
We're walking hand in hand, you've got to understand
And one day soon, we'll live in harmony
