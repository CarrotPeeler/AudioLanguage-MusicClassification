1 ContributorInto Your System LyricsShe's in control
Of your mind and soul
She's in control
Of your mind and soul
Coming out of nowhere
She will take you somewhere
You have never been before
She's attractive and seductive
She will make you outlive
Everything you're dreaming of
Oh oh
There is nothing you can do
Oh oh oh
She's gonna get you too
She's into your system
You know in your heart she's got it all
She's into your system
And you know you're losing control
Tonight inside tonight
Lovin' is a dancer
She will be the answer
Giving you the kick of life
She will make you feel the burning
Now your heart is jurning
Everything you're dreaming of

There is nothing you can do
Oh oh oh
She's gonna get you too
She's into your system
You know in your heart she's got it all
She's into your system
And you know you're losing control
Tonight inside
She's your trouble inside
And she's your pleasing delight
You're going nowhere
Cause you can't get enough
She's objective and cool
She makes you feel like a fool
Cause she's making the rules for your love
She's in control
Of your mind and soul
She's in control
Of your mind and soul
She's into your system
You know in your heart she's got it all
She's into your system
And you know you're losing control
Tonight inside
She's your trouble inside
And she's your pleasing delight
You're going nowhere
Cause you can't get enough
She's objective and cool
She makes you feel like a fool
Cause she's making the rules for you love
She's into your system
You know in your heart she's got it all
She's into your system
And you know you're losing control
Tonight inside tonight
Tonight inside tonight
Tonight inside tonightEmbed
