Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, uh, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, uh

When it rain, niggas get wet, stay dry
Three on me like I'm AI, know the stakes high
Lit the fire, and I made it out the maze fine
Paint the picture, now these niggas tryna trace mine
Early morning, gettin' to it in the daytime
Hearing whispers through the grapevine
Niggas tryna fly like 
You gon' jump to your death
Ain't the person that I was whеn I left
Know the feeling but it's stuck in your chest
And you try to spеak about it but it doesn't connect
Like it's something you left
In the way you know it's nothing to step
Walked the dirt and now it's mud in my 
In the city bumpin' , got my foot on they necks
Niggas think they got it locked until I come and collect
You the type to send a shot and say it under your breath
Try to tell these niggas I am not the one they against
Yeah, they stuck on the bench
Need the coach or the ref'
I ain't trippin', I ain't listen, boy it's fuck what they said
Wanna see me depressed, Momma love me to death
I could never have an issue with these niggas again
Only me in the end, yeah
It's only me in the end
It's only me in the end
It's only me in the end, yeah, yeah
It's only me in the end
Only me in the end
Only me in the end, yeah
It's only me in the end
It's only me in the end
It's only me in the end, yeah
It's only me in the end
It's only me in the end, yeah, yeah, uh
Right
Yeah, yeah
Right, right, right, yeahYou might also likeEmbed
