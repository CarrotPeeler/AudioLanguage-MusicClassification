4 ContributorsFoot-Long Lyrics(chorus) I want to give you all of my foot long
Unwrap my hot dog and place it in your bun
Vacation without sun
Cop without a gun
That's what she told me
So I guess there'll be no you
She sees right through me
I'm told my shallowness runs deep
You work the drive thru
Don't need a guy like you
Cuz not just anyone will do
(chorus)
You ain't no heartthrob
You'd better hold on to your job
She said I've seen your band
You guys ain't got a chance
But now I'm begging you to sing
(chorus)
That's what she told me so I guess there'll be no youYou might also likeEmbed
