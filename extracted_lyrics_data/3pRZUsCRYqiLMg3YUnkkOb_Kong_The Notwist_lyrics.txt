2 ContributorsKong LyricsThere's something wrong
With this
I don't be long
Water's coming in, water's coming in
Our house will fall
A paper wall
Mighty Kong!
Please help
I know you're strong
Are you coming in, are you coming in?
To lift us up, to lift us up
From this
When I was 9 years old
The sun was always far too cold
And the rain it wouldn't stop
And the rain, the rain, the rain
And The water filled the room
Our house got swept away
Mighty Kong!
Please help
I know you're strong
Are you coming in, are you coming in?
Drop us off
On another spot
You might also likeIt's bliss
'Cause I believe in this
'Cause I believe in this
Superheroes, ghostvillains and stuff
'Cause I believe in thisEmbed
