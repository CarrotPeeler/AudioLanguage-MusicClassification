1 ContributorWhatever LyricsI can barely see your face today
Behind your hands
You say there's no time to waste
Hoping that miracles are up to date
Before you reach the end
You say:
How could a „Lucky Jinx“ like you
Believe in a happy end
You must have known you will lose again
Still hoping tomorrow is a better day
Your tears run down your face

Whatever makes you strong again
Whatever makes you proud
Whatver makes you whole again
Please keep it on your mind
That I'll always run to you
Give you everything I have
I'll do anything, anything, anything
I can barely hear your voice today
Your words are gone
I will try to bring them back to you
Hoping
They bring you miracles that you prayed for
Before you reach the end
You might also like
Whatever makes you strong again
Whatever makes you proud
Whatver makes you whole again
Please keep it on your mind
That I'll always run to you
Give you everything I have
I'll do anything, anything, anything for you
I will cheer you up somehow
I will nail your lips to a smile
I'll be your clown
Let you scream into my face
For all the sinners, all the shame
And for you

Whatever makes you strong again
Whatever makes you proud
Whatver makes you whole again
Please keep it on your mind
That I'll always run to you
Give you everything I have

Whatever makes you strong again
Whatever makes you proud
Whatver makes you whole again
Please keep it on your mind
That I'll always run to you
Give you everything I have
I'll do anything, anything, anythingEmbed
