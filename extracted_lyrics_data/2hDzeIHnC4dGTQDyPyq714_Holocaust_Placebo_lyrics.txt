Can't get out of bed
And you can't sleep
You're sitting down to dress
And you're a mess
You look in the mirror
You look in your eyes
Then you realize

Everybody goes, leaving those
Who fall behind
Everybody goes as far as they can
They don't just care
They stood on the stairs
Laughing at your airs
Your mother's dead
She said, "Don't be afraid"
Your mother's dead
You're on your own, she's in her bed

Everybody goes, leaving those
Who fall behind
Everybody goes as far as they can
They don't just care

You're a sad eyed lie
You're a holocaust1Embed
