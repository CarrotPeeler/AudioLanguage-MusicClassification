1 ContributorA Nickel And A Nail LyricsI once had love and plenty of money
Yes I did
Someway, somehow I know I failed
Yes I did
Now all, all I have in my pocket
All I can give account of
Is a nickel and a nail
All, all I have is a nickel and a nail
My friends, oh no-no-no
They just don't know
The feel, deep down in their hearts
They think I'm doing swell
But they don't know
'Cause
Every now and then I smile
And I jingle
Yes I do
All you hear me jingeling
Is a nickel and a nail
A nickel and a nail
My chain, my price to see
But I still
Feel the need to be loved, baby
Hammering inside of me
You might also likeA nickel and a nail
My chain, my price to see
But I still
Feel the need to be loved, baby
Hammering inside of me
You said a long time ago
You said the dream was gonna be believed
You said "you'll see"
I think you better get that on
On some lonesome, lonesome trail
You gotta leave here
Oh baby I'm wondering
How d'you expect for me to make it
I don't believe I will
Oh baby I can't make it
On a nickel and a nail
If I get sleepy
All I've got baby
Is a nickel and a nail
If I get lonely
I can bend the nickel
The nail won't spin
If I get in trouble
If I get in jail
I would have enough money
To pay my bail
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
They gone too far
Said "they gone too far"
Can't do it
They gone too farEmbed
