4 ContributorsWire Shock LyricsSe doué a té doue Se doué a te doué
They live near the lake
They can't see the lake
They live near the lake
And something is nothing
And something is nothing
Akakakakakakaka
Se doué a té doue Se doué a te doué
They live near the lake
I'll tell you, they had this beautiful house
Nobody near (t)his house
Something is nothing
Something is nothingYou might also likeEmbed
