Why would I want to be like you?
The cutouts shout their insults as I'm walking down the hall
Turn around and tell them to 'go back to the shopping mall'
I won't change I won't change
I want to be strange
Why would I want to be like you?
Your comments and oppinions don't mean anything to me
I like the way I do things, so don't try to change meYou might also likeEmbed
