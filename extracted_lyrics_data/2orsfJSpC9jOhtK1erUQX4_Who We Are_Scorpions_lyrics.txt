2 ContributorsWho We Are Lyrics
Set me free, make love to me
Don't you play with my heart
I love you once, you Iove me twice
Before we part
Turn down the lights, let's kiss the night
You've showed me once what is love
I'm lost in you, you're lost in me
That's who we are
That's who we are

Who we are
We are sun and moon
Who we are
The sky black and blue
Who we are

I'm still on the run still on the roll
To find somebody, someone like you
You take my body, mind and soul
Into a world I never knew
So set me free, make love to me
Take me out of the dark
I am you and you are me
That's who we are
That’s who we are

We are sun and moon
Who we are
The sky black and blue
That’s who we areEmbed
