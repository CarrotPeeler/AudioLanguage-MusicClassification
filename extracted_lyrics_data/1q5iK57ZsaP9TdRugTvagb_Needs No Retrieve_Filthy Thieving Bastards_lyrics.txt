2 ContributorsNeeds No Retrieve LyricsI've settled down
And the kisses are bent down to my knees
I have Christmas cards to send
And the money that I lend needs no retrieve
I have whittled to the bone
The talks we have on the phone I can't concieve
I have a life that's brighter than most
I need a light that's always left on
Now if you walk through the door and you see me on the floor
You are home
I am stuck here at my work
That doesn't have a perk to make amends
But I will shovel this
To fill up the abyss of my defense
So if you have got a clue
Put it in a tube of glue, we'll make a trend
I have a life that's darker than most
I need a light that's always left on
Now if you walk through the door and you see me on the floor
You are home
If you take a simple look at what we're going through
It's for sure we need four in the rowing boat
So when push comes to the shove
And I'm left here with the dove, eat more crow
You might also likeI need a home that's darker than most
I need a light that's always left on
So if you walk through the door and you see me on the floor
You are homeEmbed
