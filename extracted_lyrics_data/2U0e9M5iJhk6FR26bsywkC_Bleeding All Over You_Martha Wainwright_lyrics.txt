3 ContributorsBleeding All Over You LyricsThere are days when the cage doesn't seem to open very wide at all
There are others that would shock the most indiscriminate lovers of all
My heart was made for bleeding all over you
You got a girlfriend and I can only talk about her for so very long
Then my mind turns into my heart and whispers into that dark cave that I've been wrong
My heart was made for bleeding all over you
And I know you're married but I've got feelings too
And I still love you
You moved up North, you've got a farmhouse
There's cowshit in your brain and love in your heart
I'm in the city and I'm trapped between two buildings and having to start at the start
You've got a daughter, now you're a father
You have your pack and they are wild
My heart was made for bleeding all over you
And I know you're married but I've got feelings too
And I still love you
I still love you
Na na, na na na na...
