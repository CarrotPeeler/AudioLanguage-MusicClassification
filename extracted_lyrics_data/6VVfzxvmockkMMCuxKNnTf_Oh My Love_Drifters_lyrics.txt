You know that I can't leave
I love you so
And you know that I will never
No, never let you go (let you go)
Oh my love, oh my love
You know that I'll always be with you
Yes you know I'll always
Oh yes, be with you
Yeah, yeah, yeah, we made a promise
Right from the start
That you would never
Break my heart
Now that you're leaving, oh if you do
And it'll break my heart into, yeah yeah
Oh my love, oh my love
You promised you'd always be with me
You said you'd never let me go
You'd never let me goSee The Drifters LiveGet tickets as low as $56You might also likeEmbed
