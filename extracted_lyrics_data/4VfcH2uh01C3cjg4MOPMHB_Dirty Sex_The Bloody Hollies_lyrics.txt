3 ContributorsMad Sex Lyrics
Man, I ain't got time for that girl
Say what?
Yeah, she always want to talk to somebody
Believe me, I know her
Yeah

I see you at another party
Dancin' all over the place
Lookin' for the perfect body
To go with the perfect face

Bushy-head mulatto breakdown
And your lips got wet today (Lips got wet today)
Same damn bird from London (Same damn cuckoo)
Finally had the nerve to say (What'd she say?)
(I'll tell ya, listen)

I used to have mad sex in the horny morning
I used to have mad sex in the afternoon
I used to have mad sex when me and this mulatto go down
To dirty up another room
You might also like
Do it 'til your tattoo's dizzy
And the stud in your mouth turns gold
'Til the animal prints you flaunt so lovely
Is full of little bloody holes

Bushy-head mulatto breakdown
And your lips got wet today
Same damn bird from London
Finally had the nerve to say
Uh, finally had the nerve to say (what'd she say?)

I used to have mad sex in the horny morning
I used to have mad sex in the afternoon
I used to have mad sex when me and this mulatto go down
To dirty up another room

Mad sex
Mad sex

Steppin' up on the others tryin' to make a jealous brutha
Get you nothin' but another night of vibration
One nation under your groove and still you can't break my cool
I see you at another party
Once again the talk of the town
Break another heart, you sorry... skench!
One day u're gonna tumble down, down, down, down
(Tumble down, down, down)
Bushy-head mulatto breakup
And u never really knew my name (What good is time?)
What good is time if you take up (What good is time if you take up)
Every day to complain? (Oh)

I used to have mad sex in the horny morning
I used to have mad sex in the afternoon
I used to have mad sex when me and this mulatto go down
To dirty up another room
I used to have mad sex in the horny morning
I used to have mad sex in the afternoon
I used to have mad sex when me and this mulatto go down
To dirty up another room

Dirty up another, dirty up another, dirty up another room (Mad sex)
Oh yeah (Mad sex)
Oh yeah (Mad sex)
Oh yeah (Mad sex)
Oh yeah (Mad sex)
I used to have mad sex
I used to have mad sex
I used to have mad sex
(Mad sex)
To dirty up another room (Dirty, dirty, dirty)
Mad sex
Made sex
Dirty, dirty
Mad sex
Made sexEmbed
