1 ContributorThe Ship LyricsYou, yeah you, I am talking to you and you know
This is not the way to behave yourself you must learn
To control yourself
Hey hey hey hey
Hey hey hey hey
You, silly you, I am lying to you and you know....this
Is not a thing to be thrown away, because you know
It won't stay away
Hey hey hey hey
Hey hey hey hey
You, HEY you, I am waiting for you and you
Know... you have always been so uncomfortable I
Would say you're impossible
Hey hey hey hey
Hey hey hey hey
Give me some time, I can never be complete
Give me a sign, I am in to deep
You, yeah you, I'm not slaving for you and you
Know... what was sometimes me and you, now is
Gone, it's really true
You, FUCK you, why you're talking to me and I don't
Know... I am not gonna behave myself, I'll never
Learn to control myself
