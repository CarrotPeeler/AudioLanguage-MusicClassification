2 ContributorsUsed To Get High LyricsI used to get high for a living
Believing everything that I saw on my TV
I used to get high for a living
Eating all the bullshit food that they sold me
I used to get high for a living
Thinking that my destiny was out of my control
I used to get high for a living
There's lots of different reasons and I'll tell you so
Super size, large fries, Big Mac, Coca-cola, go on man
Pick your poison
Speed, weed, ecstasy, LSD, man, it don't bother me
'Cos we're all on something
Caffeine, cigarettes, alcohol, you know I'm clawing at the walls Trying to get my fix
Prozac, ADD tablets, coke, smack, now you know I am
Turning tricks 'cos
I used to get high for a living
Believing everything that I saw on my TV
I used to get high for a living
Eating all the bullshit food that they sold me
Yeah, that they sold me
Escape, can't wait, all trying to get away from this place man
That we're feeling
Can't deal, can't feel, what's real all trying to conceal
All this time we're stealing
No doubt, the route you're on, can't find the clout that
You've been needing
'Til then my friend you must contend with the monster
That you're feeding
You might also likeI used to get high for a living
Believing everything that I saw on my TV
I used to get high for a living
Eating all the bullshit food that they sold me
I used to get high for a living
Thinking that my destiny was out of my control
I used to get high for a living
There's lots of different reasons and I'll tell you so
Got links of the Cheney, getting crazy, getting lazy with all their
Foreign relations
Starting wars, closing doors, trying to bring about one quicker man Revelations
Economic rationale calling fouls with the workers just trying to
Make it pay
Cost cutting, head butting, big business do what they like and you Do what they say
What's wrong get along, just prolong all the thoughts You got going on
On the inside
Appease, stand at ease, just try to please
All the apathy that you're trying to hide
How now brown cow
Did we get from this standing place
And now we're kneeling
'Til then my friend you must contend with the monster
That you're feeding
I used to get high for a living
Believing everything that I saw on my TV
I used to get high for a living
Eating all the bullshit food that they sold me
I used to get high for a living
Thinking that my destiny was out of my control
I used to get high for a living
