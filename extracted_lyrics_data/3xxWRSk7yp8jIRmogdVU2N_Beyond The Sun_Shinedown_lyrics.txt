9 ContributorsBeyond the Sun Lyrics
Speak to me, so I can understand your tongue
You seem rather fragile
It's been said, it's cold beyond the sun
Have you ever been there?

Communicating thoughts of ways, to never have to speak again
Let me be the fire in your hand

Bring what's yours, I'll take what's mine, and meet you on the other side
We'll leave a sign so anyone can find us
A better place, a sweeter time, we won't need any wings to fly
A place beyond the sun

Look for me, the way you would if you were blind
Don't be so resistant
I've been known, to travel much too fast
Is that you in the distance?

Communicating thoughts of ways, to never have to speak again
Let me be the fire in your hand

Bring what's yours, I'll take what's mine, and meet you on the other side
We'll leave a sign so anyone can find us
A better place, a sweeter time, we won't need any wings to fly
A place beyond the sun
Sun

Communicating thoughts of ways, to never have to speak again
Let me be the fire in your hand

Bring what's yours, I'll take what's mine, and meet you on the other side
We'll leave a sign so anyone can find us
A better place, a sweeter time, we won't need any wings to fly
A place beyond the sun
