I don't mind, rub the lamp
And the show goes on
I can make you travel in time and space
I can change your sex
I can change your race
You might be Genghis Khan
In burning rage
Or a go-go girl dancing in a silver cage
Still you're my master, I'm your slave
One day I'll be free to rave
Jim the Jinn, Jim the Jinn...
You can be the Queen of Sheba
In shining grace
Or Mahatma Gandhi in his holy place
Still you're my master
And I'm your slave
One day I'll be free to raveYou might also likeEmbed
