3 ContributorsRighteous Woman LyricsThere she stands in the spotlight
Now the music begins
Her left leg won't stop trembling
But there's nowhere to run
The soldier's summoned at the station
He's taken down to the hole
He limps in late in the darkness
And takes his seat in the stalls
Righteous woman starts off little
Like a dove at dawn
Righteous woman building up pressure
Like a slow moving storm
Righteous woman giving birth
To the dark unborn
Righteous woman
Righteous woman
In a blanket in a box on a hospital doorstep
Lies a baby newborn
The nurse gently picks up the bundle
But the mother is gone
In the darkness, his head falls
As the chorus arrives
He wakes up late in the third act
To those radiant eyes

Getting on her glow
Righteous woman surrendering
To the full ecstatic flow
Now she looks out and sees the brass buttons
Glinting in the tenth row
Righteous woman
Righteous woman
Righteous woman hears the knock
On her dressing room door
She takes the note and reads it
Then lets it drop to the floor
Now she drifts on down slowly
To the backstage door
Righteous woman
Righteous woman
Righteous woman
Righteous woman
Righteous woman
Righteous woman
Righteous woman
Righteous woman
