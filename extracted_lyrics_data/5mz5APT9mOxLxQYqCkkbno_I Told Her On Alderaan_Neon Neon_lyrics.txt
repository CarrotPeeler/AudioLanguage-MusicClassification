4 ContributorsI Told Her On Alderaan LyricsShe had a face from an animation
Before a cinema screen projection
And if you ever got a bad reception
She'd flash a smile and change the perception
She got suspicious of my intention (I can tell)
I didn't give her enough attention (Possibly)
Like I would give into some temptation (Never)
I think her head needed medication
I told her on Alderaan
That nothing else was going on
One day I took her to see the doctor (Hello take a seat)
He put her in a cell and locked her (Yes he did)
And all the patients, they started to mock her (That's right)
For ever thinking that someone would leave her
I told her on Alderaan
That nothing else was going on
