8 ContributorsRiot Lyrics
Are you ready? It's time for war
We'll break down these fucking doors
Smash the windows, tear down the walls
We won't stop 'til it's all destroyed

Let it out, just let it show
We'll burn it down and we'll lose control
Set the fires, can you feel the heat?
Tonight we're alive, there's no time to sleep
Whoa-oa-oah

Riot!
Whoa-oa-oah
Riot!
Whoa-oa-oah
Here come the sirens, here comes the law
Whoa-oa-oah
Run from the sirens, run from the law
Whoa-oa-oah

Round two, are you feeling alive?
We'll overcome, we'll fucking survive
Smash the boundaries, breaking the law
We can't stop 'til it's all destroyed
You might also like
Let it out, just let it go
We'll burn it down and we'll lose control
Set the fires, can you feel the heat
Tonight we're alive, there's no time to sleep?
Whoa-oa-oah

Riot!
Whoa-oa-oah
Riot!
Whoa-oa-oah
Here come the sirens, here comes the law
Whoa-oa-oah
Run from the sirens, run from the law
Whoa-oa-oah

It's time to turn it loud!


Riot!
Whoa-oa-oah
Riot!
Whoa-oa-oah
Here come the sirens, here comes the law
Whoa-oa-oah
Run from the sirens, run from the law
Whoa-oa-oah
Whoa-oa-oah
Riot!Embed
