1 ContributorPeterâ€™s Dream Lyrics
As we sit here talking
I am remarking
On your private property
It was not my intention
Not what I mentioned
You have got the wrong idea

Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah
You misunderstood
My intentions were good

 High jump,  they stayed in there 
Wrong thoughts always come out my mouth
Try to change the direction of our conversation
But it's much too late, for that

Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah
You misunderstood
My intentions were goodYou might also likeEmbed
