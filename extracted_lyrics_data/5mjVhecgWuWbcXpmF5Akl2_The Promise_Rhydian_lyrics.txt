3 ContributorsRIOT (Freestyle) LyricsI'm shocking like lightning
Getting on the microphone
I promise while I'm rhyming
All these rappers nothing to me
I'm stating in my dominance
And I'm in this game stating my business like
Speaking like a conglomerate
They fucking opposite
Promise that you ain't stopping shit
Rapping with my confidence
Promise they got no common sense
Flyer than a rocket ship
Promise that you the opposite
'Cause I be killer rappers you listening to my hypothesis
It's obvious when I'm dropping I'm rioting
Shocking all these rappers like Zeus
Throwing some lightning
Lightning bolts frightening jokes
Killing these rappers with the frightening flow
Listening I'm slicing your throat
Matter a fact slicing your skull
Inside of your skull the voice inside yo head
Making sure these rappers ending up dead
These rappers talking all this shit they pretending it's dead
But I ain't ever gonna stop boy I promise instead
Look it till I take my last breath
Until i'm on the death bed
I'm onto whats next
And fuck that this my subject
And I wreck this talk that shit
I'm at that like it's wreck it
You might also likeFuck man
This is for the people trying to send me death fucking better
Flow so cold I could probably change the weather
Man I feel like Kratos I'm the God Of War swinging the fucking sword
Write that I'm starting wars imma warlord
Coming at your with like four swords
With more force than a warlord
Swinging four swords towards your direction
I go hard no erectile dysfunction
Listen while I'm crushing these rappers
With no reluctance
Two arms out but I promise that I ain't hugging
All these rappers talking shit but every beat I can crush it
Look, aye
Damn Jek, yo, you know it though
Every time I'm rappin' I go dumb like some polio
Cause I be sick when I'm spitting boy I know it though
Halitosis with the nasty flow and ima show it though
Fuck anybody who be thinking they gon stop me
Bitch I kick in the door kinda like the swat team
Stop me imma get it kicking like karate
Jason Voorhees ain't nobody gonna block me
Friday The 13th swinging my machete
I'm your worse nightmare like my name was Freddy
Cutting up your belly till that shit look like spaghetti
Any rapper who is ready imma pop em like confetti
Damn all this shit gotta get it though
When I spit it with the flow kiss my ass mistletoe
Got the sickest flow promise I ain't typical
Bitch i'm so godly i'm classified as biblical
Damn imma G O D D O G see it's me
Gotta keep it going bitch I'm HIV cause I be sick when i be rapping
You the type of dude to act real cool
Up in school walk up to the club with a fake id
Who I be shining be like it's jewelry Tomfoolery
Kicking rappers who can school with me but you never be
At my level head shot like Kennedy
Integrity come with that energy
Murder my enemies when they will never be at my level
Flow so cold but I am hotter than the devil
I got more bars than a federal prison
These rappers they better listen
When they see me I be glistening
Like jewelry and I'm biblical Prxjek up next
They hating on me I promise that I don't stress
Shoutout to my fam you better understand
These rappers talk shit I'm so fly I never land
I'm eating all these rappers like Pac-Man
When I rap man these rappers be hating on me
They be on me like a lap dance when I rap this
I told her shave her carpet like Aladdin Princess Jasmin
Spitting to kill the beat assassin damn spitting fire kinda like a dragon
Every single beat imma bash em while I drag em
Down to the cores and i'm coming at them with force
Fuck what you saying I go sick like abortions
Fuck manEmbed
