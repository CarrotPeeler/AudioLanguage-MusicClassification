3 ContributorsYou Donâ€™t Know Me LyricsYou give your hand to me
And then you say, "Hello."
And I can hardly speak
My heart is beating so
And anyone can tell
You think you know me well
But you don't know me
Whoa you don't know the one
That thinks of you at night;
And longs to kiss your lips
Longs to squeeze you tight
To you, I'm just a friend
That's all I've ever been
You just don't know me
I never knew the art of making love
Though my heart aches with love for you
Afraid and shy, I let my chance go by
A chance that you might love me too
You give your hand to me
And then you say, "Goodbye."
I watched you walk away
Beside the lucky guy
Who'll never never know
The one who loved you so
You just don't know me
You might also likeI never knew the art of making love
Though my heart aches with love for you
Afraid and shy, I let my chance go by
A chance that you might love me too
You give your hand to me
And then you say, "Goodbye."
I watched you walk away
Beside the lucky guy
Who'll never never know
The one who loved you so
You just don't know meEmbed
