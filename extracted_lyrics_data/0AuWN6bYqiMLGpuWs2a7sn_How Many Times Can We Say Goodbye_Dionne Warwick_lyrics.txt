4 ContributorsHow Many Times Can We Say Goodbye Lyrics
Here we are so close to the end now
Still holding on, we try and pretend now
Clinging to love we both know is dying (It's dying)
We've tried and tried to find us a way out
But darling, our dreams have now all been played out
Still we go on hopelessly trying

But how many times can we say goodbye?
And how many times can we see love die?
And how many times can we give it one more try
Before we really say goodbye?
Mmm, goodbye (Goodbye)

We're so in love but wrong for each other
Each hurt that heals brings on another
Both of us used and both of us using (Hey hey)
Darling, it's time that we stop pretending (Stop)
There's just no way to rewrite our ending (No way)
We're caught in this game and we both know we're losing

Oh, but how many times can we say goodbye?
Hey, how many times can we feel love die?
Tell me how many times can we give it one more try (One more)
Before we really say goodbye?
Yeah, oh, oh-ho (Whoa)

How many times can we break up and make up?
Both of our hearts refusing to wake up
Just can't go on (No) and on living a lie
Though I'll always love you

How many times can we say goodbye?
Oh, and how many times can we live this lie?
Hey yeah, how many times can we give it one more try? (One more try)
How any times before we really (Really, really) say goodbye?

Bye-bye (Goodbye)
Bye-bye (Goodbye)
Bye-b-b-bye-bye-bye (Goodbye)
Hey hey, goodbyeEmbed
