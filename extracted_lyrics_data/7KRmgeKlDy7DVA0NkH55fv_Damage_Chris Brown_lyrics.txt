11 ContributorsDamage Lyrics
Ah, the Runners presents
Damage, you know (Woah-oh)
Sometimes you don't realize what you've done (Woah)
Until you've seen the damage (Woah-oh)
And I looked at the damage
Yeah, woah, yeah, yeah
Woah-oh, yeah, yeah
Look at the damage, yeah

3 A.M. when my phone ring
Begging me to come by, I was right around the corner (Corner)
I know I could've said no, but I ain't stop
Told me, "Come in, the door's unlocked for you"
My intuition, I should have listened to it
My girl, yo, she'd be pissed if she knew about this visit (Visit)
She had a tank top on, I took her tank top off but should've stopped (Stopped, ah)
But she ain't let me, kissed me soft and gently, she tempt me
Right then I stopped thinking consequences (Consequences)
Guess I must have lost my mind for a minute, listen

Girl, you know that I love
Girl, I love you, with her, that was lust (Yeah)
Shouldn't have happened, I know I messed up (Yeah, yeah)
One phone call started this whole thing now (Yeah)
Look at the damage (The damage)
Look at the damage (The damage)
Damage, damage that I caused you (That I caused you)
I know I broke your heart (Your heart)
'Cause I did you wrong now look at the damage (The damage)
Look at the damage that I caused
See Chris Brown LiveGet tickets as low as $43You might also like
The dumbest decision that I made that I ain't proud of
A few hours that meant absolutely nothing cost me your love (Love)
I gotta live with regret, deserve to get what you give
Now you won't listen to nothing that I'm saying (Woah-oh)
I rode passed your house for hours, just to feel close to ya
No cards, no gifts, no flowers, could get me back with you
Your kiss, your touch, girl, you know I'm missing (Hey, hey)
But you got my heart inside a prison, listen (Hey, hey, yeah, yeah)

Girl, you know that I love
Girl, I love you, with her, that was lust (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, yeah)
Shouldn't have happened, I know I messed up (Yeah, yeah)
One phone call started this whole thing now (Yeah, hey)
Look at the damage (The damage, I see the damage)
Look at the damage (The damage, that I caused you, girl)
Damage, damage that I caused you
I know that I broke your heart
'Cause I did you wrong now look at the damage (The damage)
Look at the damage that I caused

I was tripping (Oh), I was dipping (Oh)
With these women (Oh) in these streets (Oh, yeah)
Lost my girl (Oh, yeah), lost all that (Yeah)
Wish I could take it back (Yeah)
I was tripping (Hey), I was dipping (Oh)
With these women (Oh) in these streets (Oh)
Wish I could (Oh), take that back, oh, baby
Girl, you know that I love
Girl, I love you, with her, that was lust (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, yeah)
Shouldn't have happened, I know I messed up (Yeah, yeah)
One phone call started this whole thing now
Look at the damage (The damage, the damage that I)
Look at the damage (The damage)
Damage, damage that I caused you (Oh, that I caused you)
I know I broke your heart (Yeah, yeah)
And girl, I did you wrong now look at the damage (The damage)
Look at the damage that I caused

Yeah, woah
Look at the damage
Look at the damage, yeah
You know, sometimes you don't realize what you've done
Until you've seen the damage and I looked at the damage6Embed
