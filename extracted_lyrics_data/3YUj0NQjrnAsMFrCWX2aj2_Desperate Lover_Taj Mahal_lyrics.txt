How can you sleep with no one to keep you warm?
You toss and turn, you cry all night

I've got to find her and apologize
I want no one, she is just my size
Yeah, yeah, oh
Yeah, yeah, oh
Yeah, ooh, oh
Yeah, yeah

She couldn't stand it, she decided to part
She could not stand it, she could not stand it
