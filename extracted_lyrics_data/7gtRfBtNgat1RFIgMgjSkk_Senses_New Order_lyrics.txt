10 ContributorsSenses Lyrics
My eyes are weary of you before me
I see the best take the light of daybreak
It shines upon me, but still, I don't see

No reason ever was given
No reason ever was given

Two hard to recoil this moment's glory
A failed reminder of a broken story
My vague emotions one day will vanish

No reason ever was given
No reason ever was givenSee New Order LiveGet tickets as low as $139You might also likeEmbed
