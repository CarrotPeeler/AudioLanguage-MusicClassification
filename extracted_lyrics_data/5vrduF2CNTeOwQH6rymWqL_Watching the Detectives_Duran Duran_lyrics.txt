5 ContributorsWatching The Detectives Lyrics
Nice girls not one with a defect
Cellophane shrink-wrapped so correct
Red dogs under illegal legs
She looks so good that he gets down and begs

She is watching the detectives
Oh he's so cute
She is watching the detectives
When they shoot shoot shoot shoot
They beat him up until the teardrops start
But he can't be wounded cos he's got no heart

Long shot of that jumping sign
Visible shivers running down my spine
Cut the baby taking off her clothes
Close-up of the sign that says "we never close"
You snatch a tune, you match a cigarette
She pulls the eyes out with a face like a magnet
I don't know how much more of this I can take
She filing her finger nails
While they're dragging the lake

She is watching the detectives
Oh he's so cute
She is watching the detectives
Oh they shoot shoot shoot shoot
They beat him up until the teardrops start
But he can't be wounded
Cos he's got no heart
You might also like
Now you think you're alone until you realize
You're in it
Ifear is here to stay love is here for a visit
They call it instant justice when it's past
The legal limit
Someone's scratching at the window. I wonder
Who is it?
The detectives come to check if you belong to
The parents
Who are ready to hear the worst about their
Daughter's disappearance
Though it nearly took a miracle to get you to stay
It only took my little fingers to blow you away

She is
She is watching, oh
Watching the detectives
She is watching the detectives
Oh, he's so cute
She is watching the detectives
Oh, as they shoot, shoot, shootEmbed
