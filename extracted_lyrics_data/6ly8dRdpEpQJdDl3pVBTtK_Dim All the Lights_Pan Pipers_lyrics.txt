Through all the ages, I have sought not other lover.
I have followed o'er land and sea,
dim vale and mystic mountains,
I have heard Pan's pipes amid moon-dappled woodlands
and have seen the satyrs frolicking with nymphs upon
The fragrant swards, while the night-breezes
murmured among the leaves.
I have watched your lateened feluccas
a-leap upon turquoise seas of morn,
And I have stood upon your snow-browed peaks
and seen the lavender slopes of your brooding mountains
Stretching away to the amethyst sky-line.
I have heard the berg song of your Arctic floes
and have watched
Your Northern Lights flaring
in god-like grandeur from the Pole.
I have sailed your seas. And I have seen the boundless desert
sands, all purple in the sunset, spread to
The brooding horizons. I have trod your nameless jungles,
dared your turbid rivers;
Harked to the shadowy jungle, where it brooded, bestial chin
on midnight hand, like a sullen giant of darkness.
And I've seen your nameless mountains rise from the sea
of tangled forest, and stand like sightless somber gods
Against the twilight. Adventure, I desire no other lover.
I have followed your ways about the world and yet again.
All the ages that have clanged to your stride,
have known my step.
My feet are dusty with the musk of antiquity,
my hands clutch the stars from their sockets.
Adventure, you are wondrous with mystic beauty.
Your tresses snare the stars and you are dusky-breasted
As Egyptian dawns. Your eyes are soft twin planets of mystic
allure, speaking of all the wonders of all the eons.
Your voice is soft, as melodies of the harp of Arion and
there runs in haunting refrain a thousand minor notes.
The song of Circe is there, the whisper of the dawn-winds.2Embed
