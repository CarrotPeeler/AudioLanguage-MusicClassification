6 ContributorsThe Deeper the Love Lyrics
When I look back on everything I've done
I know you must have cried a river of tears
But you were there when I was feelin' low
To walk me through my darkest fears

So when the Sun goes down
And those nights grow colder
I will be there
Lookin' over your shoulder

And the deeper the love
The stronger the emotion
And the stronger the love
The deeper the devotion

There were times I almost let you go
When I thought I needed to break free
But you were there to whisper in my ear
Why don't you share your dreams with me?

So when the Sun goes down
And those nights are growin' colder
I will be there
Looking over your shoulder
You might also like
And the deeper the love
The stronger the emotion
And the stronger the love
The deeper the devotion

I don't mind what you're doin' to me
I don't mind 'cause you're all I can see
I don't mind, baby you mean the world to me

When the Sun goes down
And those nights are growin' colder
I will be there
Lookin' over your shoulder
Baby, baby, baby


So when the Sun goes down
And those nights are growin' colder
I will be there
Lookin' over your shoulder
'Cause the deeper the love
The stronger the emotion
And the stronger the love
The deeper the devotion
(Get into it, babe)

The deeper the love
The stronger the emotion
And the stronger the love
The deeper, the deeper
The deeper the devotion

I never gonna let you go
In my heart, I know
I really love ya, I love ya
Ooh babe, I really love you
Ooh, huh-huh-hoo-hooEmbed
