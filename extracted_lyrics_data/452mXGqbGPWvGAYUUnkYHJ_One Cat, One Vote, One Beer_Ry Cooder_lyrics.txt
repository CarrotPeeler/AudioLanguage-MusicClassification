1 ContributorOne Cat, One Vote, One Beer Lyrics
Hey bartender, what you say
I'm gonna get drunk on election day!
Want one glass of bourbon, one glass rye
Come on, set me up, Joe, don't pass me by
My money's alright and my feets got sore
See, I've been tryin' to vote, now 'bout an hour or more
I tried, but I didn't get nowhere
Joe, you know I just don't think they are doing this voting fair and square

Better make it one cat, one vote, and one beer
Bartender, one cat, one vote, and one beer

See, I went downtown to the voting room
'Cause I wanted to get my voting done soon
Man said, "Now we're gonna have to do a little checking on you"
Come back a little later on and said
"Well, Buddy, you know your vote just can't go through
Says you've been dead, ten years back
We're sure not gonna take a vote off a, a dead red cat"
"What you say?"
"Step aside now, you're interfering with the election process, that's a crime"
"The crime is you!"
"Well, Buddy, voting is just something I don't think you're going to do"

One cat, one vote, and one beer
Ain't that a shame
One cat, one vote, and one beer
Bartender!

I'm gonna drink a little gin and some mellow wine
Then I'm gonna try that voting machine out just one more time
'Cause democracy is in our hands, but it's slipping through our fingers just like sand
Now I'm worried for you, sure worried for me, watching the election comin' round on the T.V
Voting's closed, we already lost the race
Might as well meet me down to Little Joe's Place

Make it one cat, one vote, and one beer
Dog my cats you know
I guess just make it one cat, one vote, and one beer
One cat, and one vote, and one beer
