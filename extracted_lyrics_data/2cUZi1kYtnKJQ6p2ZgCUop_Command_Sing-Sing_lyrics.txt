1 ContributorCommand LyricsIf I could command you
I’d make you say something wonderful
Without even thinking
You couldn’t help yourself
You would open wide and dramatise
And tell me everything
I wouldn’t interrupt
If I could command you
And maybe I do, and maybe I do

But it’s all make believe in the steely dusk
While you’re quite unaware of my possessive thoughts
I keep it secret and wait for you, I’ll wait

If I could command you
You’d never keep other company
You wouldn’t even want to
Your eyes are just for me
There would be no need to keep a key
Or hide your shoes
You’d feel free anyway
If I could command you
And maybe I do, and maybe I do
You might also like
But it’s all make believe in the steely dusk
While you’re quite unaware of my possessive thoughts
I keep it secret and wait for you, I’ll wait
If you could command me
I’d never ask the impossible
Or watch your every action
Or wouldn’t care at all
You would come and go, I’d never know
You beat me to the post
While I’d bring up the rear
If you could command me
And really you do, and really you do

And it’s all make believe in the steely dusk
While I’m quite unaware of your forbidden thoughts
You keep it secret and wait for me, you’ll wait

If I could, if I could, if I could, if I could
If I could, if I could, if I could, if I could
