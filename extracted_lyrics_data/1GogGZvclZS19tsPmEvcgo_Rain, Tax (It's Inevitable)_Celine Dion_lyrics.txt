7 ContributorsRain, Tax (Itâ€™s Inevitable) Lyrics
It's inevitable
Mm-mm, hmm

I did not know there was a plan
Somewhere a perfect man
I don't believe in the stars
And then you smiled at my pretense
As you broke down my defenses
Just wanna be where you are
Love ain't like fashion
The look remains the same
I'll wear your heart forever
'Cause some things never change

Like rain, tax
After lightning the thunder cracks (It's inevitable)
Sooner or later, it had to come true
Like rain, tax
Weeds grow up through the pavement cracks (It's inevitable)
You see what I want
What I want is you

I thought that life was logical
Love was a miracle
That happened to someone else, not me
Baby, I must've said a little prayer
Suddenly I looked up and you were there
And the rest is history
I don't wanna be an island anymore
Just resign yourself
'Cause there's one thing for sure
You might also like
Like rain, tax
After lightning the thunder cracks (It's inevitable)
Sooner or later, it had to come true (It's inevitable)
Like rain, tax
Weeds grow up through the pavement cracks (It's inevitable)
You see what I want
What I want is you
Yeah

It had to be you
It had to be you
Say you'll be here forever
You and me here together
(When will you see what I want)
What I want is you

Like rain, tax
After lightning the thunder cracks (It's inevitable)
Sooner or later, it had to come true
Like rain (Rain), tax (Tax)
Weeds grow up through the pavement cracks (It's inevitable)
You see what I want
What I want is you  (It's inevitable)
Like rain (Rain), tax
After lightning the thunder cracks (It's inevitable)
(You could see what I want)
Sooner or later, it had to come true (It's inevitable)
Like rain, tax (Ooh)
Weeds grow up through the pavement cracks (It's inevitable)
You could see what I want
What I want is you
Like rain (Rain), taxEmbed
