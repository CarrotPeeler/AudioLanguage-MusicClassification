I wanna roll, wanna chief, wanna smoke me a blunt
I wanna get fucked up
Wanna smoke (Wanna smoke)
Wanna choke (Wanna smoke)
Wanna get fucked up

I'm rolling up so many blunts, mane
I'm smokin' and chokin' 'em back to back
Come on and blink
Oh no, I just think, I'm having another ink attack
I like to smoke so much weed, it's a need
I gotta have bud in my system, black
Laid back with a Yac and a sack of indo in my Cadillac
Seville, as I chill, I suppose where the hoes, mane, I'm so high
I feel like I'm about to float up in the clouds and touch the sky
The chronic has got me so dazed, it's amazing
I wanna smoke until I pass out, get the mask out
And let me hit it until this chronic knocks my ass out
I'ma crash out and sleep until morning, I'm yawning
So what can I say, mane, for a day, mane
I don't think that I can even go without smoking hay, mane
So pass me a swisher and let me spit the middle and fill it with weed
And lick it and light it and chief it and pass it around to my crew, 'cause I know that you need
RedRum, niggas smoke bud by the pound, and it's all good
In the hood we chillin' and chiefing, hanging out in the broken wood
My nigga, I figure, I need more weed, so that I can choke
I'm fiendin' and dreamin' about that chronic I wanna smoke
You might also like
I wanna roll, wanna chief, wanna smoke me a blunt
I wanna get fucked up
Wanna smoke (Wanna smoke)
Wanna choke (Wanna choke)
Wanna get fucked up
I wanna roll, wanna chief, wanna smoke me a blunt
I wanna get fucked up
Wanna smoke (Wanna smoke)
Wanna choke (Wanna choke)
Wanna get fucked up

I'm smokin' and chokin' on blunts
Everyday, 'cause Psycho acts that way
The chicken is making me wicked and paranoid
Have gotta have that hay
Coming up out of the ground, it's by the pound
And huffing to get so high
Pull out my papers and inhale the vapors
And sit back to let my brain fry
Puffing on Sess, now it's in my chest
My nigga and I feel like coughing and choke
Blow me a gun, unless it's a bum
My nigga lets fill our bodies with smoke
I'm falling in love, I'm full of that bud
'Cause we's in that party and get so woke
I lit up that nine, 'cause it by the time
We reefing around to get fucked up
Let's grab us some brew, now this what we do
We slanging and banging up on the main strip
I'm getting so high, I cannot deny
I'm starting to think some crazy shit
We rolling so clean, I'm hearing sirens
A nigga like me is so paranoid
I roll down the window and let out the indo
Those wicked ass the cops, we tryna avoid
Keep rolling up weed, you know it's a need
My nigga I'm full of that Mary Jane
'Cause it's the most wanted and I'ma stay blunted
Until I feel like I'm going insane
Keep rolling up swishers
They filled with that reefer and don't let this dope
Get in your ride, I meant to decide
My nigga, 'cause you know that I wanna smoke
I wanna roll, wanna chief, wanna smoke me a blunt
I wanna get fucked up
Wanna smoke (Wanna smoke)
Wanna choke (Wanna choke)
Wanna get fucked up
I wanna roll wanna chief wanna smoke me a blunt
I wanna get fucked up
Wanna smoke (Wanna smoke)
Wanna choke (Wanna smoke)
Wanna get fucked up

I'm rolling up so many blunts, mane
I'm smokin' and chokin' 'em back to back
Come on and blink
Oh no, I just think, I'm having another ink attack
I like to smoke so much weed, it's a need
I gotta have bud in my system, black
Laid back with a Yac and a sack of indo in my Cadillac
Seville, as I chill, I suppose where the hoes, mane, I'm so high
I feel like I'm about to float up in the clouds and touch the sky
The chronic has got me so dazed, it's amazing
I wanna smoke until I pass out, get the mask out
And let me hit it until this chronic knocks my ass out
I'ma crash out and sleep until morning, I'm yawning
So what can I say, mane, for a day, mane
