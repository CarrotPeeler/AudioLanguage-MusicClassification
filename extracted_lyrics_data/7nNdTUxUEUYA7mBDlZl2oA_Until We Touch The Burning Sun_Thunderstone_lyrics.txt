3 ContributorsUntil We Touch the Burning Sun LyricsI'm watching through the frozen window
Through the reflection of my face. There's a cold world out there
And i'm here,and deceitfully fine...
This is my world. My haven, my home
Where i can be alone
Only hear and see
Hear and see things that really matter to me
When i open the door and look upon the haze, i can see a million eyes
And the way they're gazing at me
Walking through the misery. Surrounded by the things
That i don't want to see
I can feel the hopeless pain, and it's driving me insane
And today i'll make a promise just to break it my tomorrow
We will never learn,we will never turn. Our eyes to the world where
The pain is reality
We will never see, we will never believe. Until we touch the burning sun
I feel the breeze.The breeze that makes me realize
That i am not alone. I'm here,i'm home and safe again
Behind the doors,locked inside
Never want to leave againYou might also likeEmbed
