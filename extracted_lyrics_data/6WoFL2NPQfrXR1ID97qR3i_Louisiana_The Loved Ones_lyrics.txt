They're pounding nails in Louisiana, they're pounding nails

They're pounding nails in Louisiana, they're pounding nails
They're pounding nails in Louisiana, they're pounding nails
They're pounding nails in Louisiana, they're pounding nails
They're pounding nails in Louisiana, down in Biloxi and Alabama

They're pounding nails in Louisiana, down in Biloxi and Alabama
They're pounding nails in Louisiana, they're pounding nails
They're pounding nails
And you can leave them there, you can walk away
You can point your guns and hope they'll stay
But they'll fold their hands and start to pray
A little faith can heal a heart that's been betrayed
And you can leave them there, you can walk away
You can point your guns and hope they'll stay
But they'll fold their hands and start to pray
A little faith can heal a heart that's been betrayed
