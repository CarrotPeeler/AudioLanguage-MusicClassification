2 ContributorsOn the Edge LyricsWhat kind of evil is inside of you you lie to my face when you tell me your truth you're not the same girl that i used to know you live in a nightmare you whole life's a show that's on the edge on the edge it goes on and on, on and on so many things you do just for fun not much you can do that hasn't been done no sense in giving if you've got nothing to give no sense in living if you don't want to live deny the problem but it won't go away look to your future, not day to day you can't run away when the problem's inside you've got to find the source you just can't hide no one can help you, you don't want their help a slap in the face is better than a stab in the backYou might also likeEmbed
