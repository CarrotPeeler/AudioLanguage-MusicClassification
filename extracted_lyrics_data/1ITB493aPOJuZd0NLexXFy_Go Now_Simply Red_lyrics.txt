1 ContributorGo Now LyricsWe’ve already said...Goodbye
(don’t you even try, don’t you even try)
Since you gotta go, oh, you’d better Go now
(go now)
Since you gotta go, oh, you’d better Go now
(go now,go now)Go now
Before you see me cry
I just want you to tell me
Just what you intend to do now
Can’t you see,darling,darling
I’m still in love with you now Whoa-oh
Telling me that you really don’t want me to
To end this way
Can’t you see,darling,darling
Can’t you see I want you to stay
Since you gotta go, oh, you’d better Go now
(go now, go now)
Since you gotta go, oh, you’d better Go now
(go now, go now) Go now
We’ve already said so long
I just want you to tell me
Just what you intend to do now
Can’t you see,darling,darling
I’m still in love with you now Whoa-oh
Telling me that you really don’t want me to
Want me to end this way
Can’t you see, darling, darling
Can’t you see I want you to stay
