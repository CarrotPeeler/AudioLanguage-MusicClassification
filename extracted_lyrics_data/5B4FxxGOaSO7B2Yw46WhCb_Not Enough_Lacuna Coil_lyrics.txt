3 ContributorsNot Enough Lyrics
I don't want to be saved but I wanna go down with you
Together we will find a way to come back...
Come back... Come back...

I don't want to be saved but I wanna go down with you
Together we will find a way to come back...

I thought it was too late
I thought you disappeared
It's been a while since I believed in you
I used to have the strength
I used to just walk away
But now that I see you
It's not enough
It's not enough

I don't want to be saved but I wanna go down with you
Together we will find a way to come back...

I'm falling once again
I'm following the way
Nothing's changed since I believed in you
I knew that you would come
I thought that I'd be afraid
But now that I have you
It's not enough
It's not enough...

I don't want to be saved but I wanna go down with you
Together we will find a way to come back...

Forgotten fears
I throw away all of the caution out into the wind
My soul is thirsty
And I'm still dreaming of you
Get out of my mind... (come back...)
Get out of my mind... (come back...)
Get out of my mind...

I don't want to be saved but I wanna go down with you
Together we will find a way to come back...
I don't want to be saved but I wanna give in to you
Together we will find a way to come back...Embed
