7 ContributorsHare Tarot Lies LyricsA blush of sun
A kiss of wind
Branches and grooves
Heat soaked red skin
You take me up sometimes
Just to find a way to bring me back down
You take me up sometimes
Just to find a way to bring me back down
I'll make it up in mine
Just to find a way to bring me back down
You take me up sometimes
Just to find a way to bring me back down
Derail, derail age
Freeze time to the bone
We can do it all
We all end up alone
You take me up sometimes
Just to find a way to bring me back down
You take me up sometimes
Just to find a way to bring me back down
I'll make it up in mine
Just to find a way to bring me back down
You take me up sometimes
Just to find a way to bring me back downYou might also likeEmbed
