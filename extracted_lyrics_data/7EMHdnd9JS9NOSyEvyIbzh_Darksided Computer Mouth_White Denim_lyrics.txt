3 ContributorsDarksided Computer Mouth LyricsYou better pick it up
If you want to throw it back down
You better wrestle it out
Before it sucks back in
You gotta rough that shit up
And drag it into your scene
You know you have to read words hard
If you're trying to merge into 
(Come here, you wanna sing?
Here we go, get ready
Here it is)
I would rather be with you
Sitting with you, sitting with me
I would rather be with you
Sitting with you, sitting with me
I would rather be with you
Sitting with you, sitting with me
Shake down
You darksided computer mouth
Shake down
You darksided computer mouth
Shake down
