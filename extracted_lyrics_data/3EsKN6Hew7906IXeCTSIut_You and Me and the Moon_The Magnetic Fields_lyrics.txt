9 ContributorsYou and Me and the Moon Lyrics
Brian Wilson, 1960 and Vine
Summer kisses
In a Pendleton shirt, songs and gentle words
Granted wishes

When you look in my eyes, I go soft inside
And the sound of your voice sends shivers up my spine
And at the slightest touch we're in love
You and me and the moon
You and me and the moon

In a cool gay bar, where the people are
Entertaining
When the sun clocks in, we'll still be talking
And champagning

Underneath the strobe lights, we can dance all night
I'm a little bit shy, you're easy on the eye
And at the slightest touch we're in love
You and me and the moon
You and me and the moon
See The Magnetic Fields LiveGet tickets as low as $69You might also like
When you look in my eyes, I go soft inside
And the sound of your voice sends shivers up my spine
And at the slightest touch we're in love
You and me and the moon
You and me and the moon
You and me and the moon
You and me and the moonEmbed
