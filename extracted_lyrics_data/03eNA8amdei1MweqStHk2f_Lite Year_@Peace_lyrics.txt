1 ContributorHousing Perspective LyricsINTRO
I'mma tell you now you shouldn't even go to the PJ’s
Unless you know somebody they're and they said that it's ok
And if you do they better know before you get there meet them half way
Cause we hungry and you only eat what we can kill
HOOK
Project living ain't easy
Everybody looking for the one  up
Pitching on the corner bruh believe me
Only way they see to get this come up Im sure theirs other way we could have got it  today Instead they took the juxk
MIKE LARRY DRAW VERSE

C47 was the public school I been at
And Black Compositions where I usually place my pen at
Couldn’t pay attention do to all my little homies
Picking fights with other little niggas acting phony
Junior high was Just THE Same BUT Different
Now the fights became more madness and no one will ever listen Cause we from projects  Watson Ave savage  Any girl walking by you know we had to bag it
Hold up
In their teens they were fiends for some weed not a joke
Out of all my PJ homies I'm the one that didn't smoke
Older beef came around
And a gun they start to taut
Lose a friend lose a foe
Did our best to stay awoke
Dice game got em mad
Growing up to damn fast
You Jump for your food  And you paid to dam bad
This the world i saw and it made me who I am
A project kid from the bronx
Doing all the best I can
HOOK
Project living ain't easy
Everybody looking for the one  up
Pitching on the corner bruh believe me
Only way they see to get this come up I sure theirs other way we could have got it  today
Instead they took the juxk

Walking past the projects
Where survival is the mind set
To play some arcade games with momma's quarters in pocket
Some niggas tried to play me guess they
Noticed I was modest
Tried to push me off the game I had to push me back like stop it
Now they whispering gossip bout how they gone get me jumped
See we came For fun and games but it would seem it's not as fun
From right around the corner just a kid that's really different
Only hit the PJ's to go visit misses like a light year
So peace to cats like Mike who crafted dreams right out they nightmare
And peace to all the cats that came from that who kept they shit Kitchen
Or with Lombe up at King Dome
Niggas getting live here
Walk up to some niggas talking tough and you may die here
Pain is real so every millisecond’s together
College or business venture
Homie you go win forever
Those who still for trapped just know you always got the key
Just hope that you realize that it ain't always you or me
