Obliterate the Sunday
You've been cherishing all week
Obliterate the Sunday
He's a pleasure you can keep

Thought you'd learn Newspeak today
But Esperanto's out of date
It's just another Sunday
Now Top of the Pops is dead

And if the morning gets you down
And then the evening lets you down
Obliterating Sunday's fair play

Obliterate the Sunday
Just keep your phone away
Exposing wrong intentions
Won't make it easier to wake

A season of illusions
A pocket full of doubts
A night of fading stars
And a legacy of clouds
You might also like
Obliterate the Sunday
The glass is out of reach
The heat wave's low relief
You'll find a palm tree in your sleep

You're hiding from monsters, dodging the seas
You spent the day scheming, you're the Houdini
Train has pulled up, light has pulled in
A chance of escape, come right up the street

Obliterate the Sunday
You've been cherishing all week
Obliterate the Sunday
He's a pleasure you can keep

A season of illusions
A pocket full of doubts
A night of fading stars
And a legacy of clouds

And if the morning gets you down
And then the evening lets you down
Obliterating Sunday's fair play
You're hiding from monsters, dodging the seas
You spent the day scheming, you're the Houdini
Train has pulled up, light has pulled in
A chance of escape, come right up the street

You're hiding from monsters, dodging the seas
You spent the day scheming, you're the Houdini
Train has pulled up, light has pulled in
A chance of escape, come right up the street

You're hiding from monsters, dodging the seas
You spent the day scheming, you're the Houdini
Train has pulled up, light has pulled in
A chance of escape, come right up the streetEmbed
