4 ContributorsThe Seed ov I LyricsFrom the top ov the highest mountain
Prior to descent, my fall for Thee
My weapon is silence
I, bringer ov light to burn this goddamn Eden down!
Behold! I rise from primal silence
As a storm crushing dismal shores ov Acheron
My weapon is violence
From the mud ov the earth
Back to the womb ov Babalon!
Sink in the stream ov woe
Acheron!
Rise above the eyes ov god
Necromanteion!
I am the oracle
I am the grace ov god
I am the stream ov woe
I am wrath from above
From Neptunian realm arisen
Babylon the great I praised
With the voice ov silence
I called the genii ov the heights and depths
I came down as the raging Mars
As volcanic fire god
Totality and I are one
In the absence ov light
Infinite I shall become

Rise above the eyes ov god
Necromanteion!
Sink in the stream ov woe
Acheron!
Rise above the eyes ov god
