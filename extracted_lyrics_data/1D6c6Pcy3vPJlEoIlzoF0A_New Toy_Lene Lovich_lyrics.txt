Did I ask you for your love?
Did I ask you for your dedication?
I don't want, I don't want your love
I don't want, I don't want your affection!

But I've got to have the car
I need it for the weekend
I've got to have the stereo
And a couple of deletions
I've got to have the freezer
Put some fun back in my eating
I've got to have it all until I'm complete!

I want a New Toy (oh ay oh), to keep my head expanding (ta)
I want a New Toy (oh ay oh), nothing too demanding (ta)
Then when everything is in roses everything is static (ta)
Yeh my New Toy (oh ay oh), you'll find us in the attic

You.. Sometimes you make me feel... I feel so insecure
Sometimes you make me feel... nothing at all

I'm sick of the TV
Well look at the news
I'm sick of the radio
But what can you do?
I'm sick of the Hoover
I'm sick of it all, so what can I do?
You might also like
I get a New Toy (oh ay oh), to keep my head expanding (ta)
I get a New Toy (oh ay oh), nothing too demanding (ta)
Then when everything is in roses you don't get any headroom (ta)
Yeh my New Toy (oh ay oh), you'll find us in the bedroom, yeh
New Toy
