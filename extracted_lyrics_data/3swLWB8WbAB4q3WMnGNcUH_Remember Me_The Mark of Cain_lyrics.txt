1 ContributorRemember Me LyricsIs this the way things have to be?
Steeped in the ways of misery?
Locked in a room that's meant for two
Uncertain terms, uncertain views
You always wanted to be alone
Well he's your choice, no easy task
But if you feel there is no point
There's just one thing
Remember me
Remember me
Well what was wrong with you today?
Is it the same as yesterday?
They tears for you or tears for me?
I guess what was, was meant to be
And I don't want to be alone
But I don't want to be with you
But there's a choice for you to make
But there's just one thing
Remember me
Remember me
I was the one the only one
I was the one the only one
You might also likeRemember me
Remember me
I was the one the only one
I was the one the only one
And when you thought it had gone away
It comes again another day
Do you think I'd turn my back on you?
Forget the times when we were two
You never wanted to be alone
Well here's your choice now have your fun
It's time for truth for everyone
You won't hear me say
Remember me
Remember me
I was the one the only one
I was the one the only one
Remember meEmbed
