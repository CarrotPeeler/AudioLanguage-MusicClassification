7 ContributorsUseless (The Kruder + Dorfmeister Session) Lyrics
Echoing
Echoing in my mind


Well it's about time (Time)
It's beginning to hurt (Time)
Time you made up your mind (Time)
Just what is it all worth?


Watch the clock on the wall (Time)
Feel the slowing of time (Time)
Hear a voice in the hall (Time)
Echoing in my mind


(Time)
Here I stand the accused (Time)
With your fist in my face (Time)
Feeling tired and bruised (Time)
With the bitterest taste
