1 ContributorI.O.U. My Love LyricsIf you just stop and listen
Then you might hear the words
That i've been trying to tell you
I guess you never heard
There's something about you baby
I don't know what it is
Can't put my finger on it
I.o.u. my love
I'm driving to the city
Let's meet in the arcade
I show you what i'm made of
Pretend you never paid
There's something about you baby
I don't know what it is
Can't put my finger on it
I.o.u. my love
It's getting past eleven
When are you gonna come
Feels like i've waited forever
A double bed for one
There's something about you baby
I don't know what it is
Can't put my finger on it
I.o.u. my loveSee Jay-Jay Johanson LiveGet tickets as low as $36You might also likeEmbed
