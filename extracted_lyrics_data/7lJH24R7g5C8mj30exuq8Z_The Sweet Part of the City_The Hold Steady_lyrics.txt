9 ContributorsThe Sweet Part of the City Lyrics
Back when we were living up on Hennepin
She kept threatening to turn us in
At night she mostly liked us
We used to pass around the thermos
Some nights she was gorgeous

We were living it
We delivered it
We didn't feel a thing
We were living in

The sweet part of the city
The parts with the bars and restaurants
We used to meet underneath the marquees
We used to nod off in the matinees
She always claimed that she was from Tennessee
And now it seems to me

Like distance doesn't equal rate and time no more
It's like gravity doesn't apply
Now everything sparkles and appears like we're on wheels
It was dark, but I guess that's the deal
You might also like
St. Theresa showed up wearing see-through
It was standard issue
We went out to get some more wine
But it's a long haul to the corner store
From the center of the universe
When you can't get your car off the curb

We were living it
We delivered it
We didn't feel a thing
We were in heaven then

The sweet part of the city
The parts with the bars and restaurants
So we shot ourselves out into outer space
It was tough to place the after taste
It was stark, but it was spacious

It's a long way from Cedar-Riverside to Cedars-Sinai
Three times St. Paul to Cheyenne
And it's a long way from Sacramento too
We were bored, so we started a band
We like to play for you
We like to pray for you
We like to pray for you
We like to play for youEmbed
