Check it, check it, check it
Ay, ay get some blonts mane
Yeah, yeah, yeah
(Tell him get some cereal too!)
Nah nah get some palmas. Don’t back here with that fuckin’ mint shit
(No captain crunch though, that shit cuts the roof of your mouth. It’s wack!)
Get some voodoo chips too and a motherfucking Arizona. Yea, you know which one. Don’t forget the fuckin’ blunt, for real

I almost forgot the blunt was in my ear when I walked into Kroger
I’ve done that shit too many times but that’s what it’s like when you’re a smoker
It’s cool I won’t forget then I walk out with half the list
Almond milk and captain crunch thеn on the way out I’ll grab a Dutch
Then give a dollar to thе guy who just got out of jail yea he just tryna catch the bus
Never had a lot but we had enough and sometimes been down bad as fuck
Whether Cutler ridge or Riverdale it doesn’t matter where I get my mail
Same shit different smell, I got love got blood both living there
I remember no kitchenware, sitting on the stairs
Smoking cigarette and sipping beers
Sandwiches at beggars corner, $2 got you a whole sub
2 loosies and a 4 pack of Nat to go with the cold cuts
Kick up dust in them old chucks, someones gonna shoot the porch up
Head lights cut off then scatter, I know some dudes that done lost their bladder
Twelve rolls thru and they log their data
Nobody died and that’s all that matters
I know some folks have died half as old as I, on a shirt immortalized I’m
Mortified it’s normalized why not organize and fortify minds huh?
High talking sky walking no car Christopher Walken
To the store cuz I can’t find my light I lost it
You might also likeFuck man I think I dropped my lighter back there. Ight fuck it lets go
I almost forgot the blunt was in my ear when I walked in the sto’ (shit)
I’ve don’t that shit too many times but that’s what it’s like when you smoke (oh well)
It’s cool I won’t forget then I walk out with a bag of chips
A Dutch some other stuff and head back to the crib
Some twilight shit, change in my hand and nobody asking for shit
What the fuck buddy must’ve already got on the bus
This extra buck gon’ come in clutch, I ain’t gon’ lie I just re’d up and one two pack ain’t gon’ be enough
I don’t know about you but I smoke
You know about this Buddha I roll
Kill bout 4 or 5 Doobies in a row ROACH KILLA

Fuck.. fuck, this guy gave me a bum lighterEmbed
