2 ContributorsStrange World LyricsTake your... seats!
Until it crashes
Until it crashes
I'll be in this plane
It's so exciting
Oh, so exciting
Don't shut your eyes
They look so frightened
You look so frightened
I'm having fun
I want to be there
I want to be there
And witness it all
Strange, strange, strange words
All they could say about me
Such a strange world, strange, strange world
That we all had to live in
Just what can they say?
Who can they pray?
Tell me what can they do?
You might also likeI feel it coming
I feel it coming
Time for the last sip
It's so amusing
Oh, so amusing
Why can't they see?
I burst out laughing
I'm crying, laughing
You look so pale
Then there's a big noise
I'm hearing your voice
Then we're on our way...
Hello, angels!
Strange, strange, strange words
All they could say about me
Such a strange world, strange, strange world
That we all had to live in
Strange, strange, strange words
All they could say about me
Such a strange world, strange, strange world
That we all had to live inEmbed
