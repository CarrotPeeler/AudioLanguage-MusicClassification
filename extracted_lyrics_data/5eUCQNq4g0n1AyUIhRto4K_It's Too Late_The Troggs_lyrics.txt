Would you do it all over again?
Would you take so much for granted
Like you did way back and then
Would you spend your life with me, girl
Or take off with another man?
It's too late, my friend, it's too late
It's too late, my friend, it's too late
When I think of you baby
Of all you've done to me
Those walks we took down leafy lanes
Those times aren't gonna come back, oh no
Those times aren't gonna come back
Well now I know what I know now
I should have taken some fast advice
I would have kept my freedom baby
I said I thought about it once or twice
I spent my life with you girl
And you've run off with another man
It's too late, my friend, it's too late
It's too late, my friend, it's too late
You might also likeWhen I think of you baby
Of what you've done to me
It doesn't seem like yesterday
Those times aren't gonna come back, oh no
Those times aren't gonna come back
It's too late, my friend
It's too late, my friend
It's too late, my friend
(goodbye friend)Embed
