Sittin' here together
Baby, we're all alone
Now I can tell ya
Girl, you turn me on

I get lifted up
High, high, high, high
I get lifted up
High, high, high, high

Bring out the lovin'
Lovin' desire, baby
You got the match
Oh, that lights the fire

I get lifted up
High, high, high, high
I get lifted up
High, high, high, high

Ma-ma-ma, ma-ma-ma, woo
Ma-ma-ma, ma-ma-ma, woo

High, high, high, high
I get lifted up
High, high, high, high

Oh, oh
Ma-ma-ma, ma-ma-ma, woo
Oh, oh
Ma-ma-ma, ma-ma-ma, woo
Hey, uh
Ma-ma-ma, ma-ma-ma

I get lifted, I get lifted up
High, high, high, high
I get lifted, I get lifted up
High, high, high, high
I get lifted, I get lifted up
High, high, high, high
I get lifted, I get lifted1Embed
