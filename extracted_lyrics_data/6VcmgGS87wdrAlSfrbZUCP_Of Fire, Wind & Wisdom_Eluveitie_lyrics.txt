5 ContributorsOf Fire, Wind & Wisdom Lyrics...the endless knot .... the holy grove...
...the threshold ... the place beyond...
...I enter, like a newborn child....
Embracing the eternal
Like a consuming fire
The knowledge grows
When it's cleft
Though still patchworked
Yet flooding
The creating touch
Washing away the vile
Embracing the ancient
While trees gently whisper
Those intimate
Longed-for words
The greet wheel
Is still revolving
With untouchable sovereignty
So invulnerable
Into the sacred grove I drown
The endless knot
Draws me into
The fire of hearts, the place beyond
Then I'll be born
Then I'll be renewed
