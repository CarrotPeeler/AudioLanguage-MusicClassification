2 ContributorsIâ€™m Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman LyricsShe used to think
She had the answers to everything
But now she knows
Life doesn't always go her way, yeah
Feels like she's caught in the middle
That's when she realized
She's not a girl
(She's not a girl, she's not a girl)
Not yet a woman
(She's not a woman, not yet a woman)
All she needs is time
A moment in her mind
While she's in between
She's not a girl (not a girl)
There is no need to protect her (to protect her)
It's time to cheat (time to cheat)
Learn to face up to this on her own, yeah
She's seen so much more than you know now (that you know now)
So don't tell her to shut my eyes
She's not a girl
(She's not a girl)
Not yet a woman
(Not a woman)
Oh all she needs is time
A moment in her mind
While she's in between
She's not a girl
She's not a girl
But if you look at her closely
You will see it in her eyes
This girl will always find her way
She's not a girl
(She's not a girl don't tell her what to believe)
Not yet a woman
(She is just trying to find the woman to see)
All she needs is time
A moment in her mind
While she's in between
(She's not a girl don't tell her what to believe)
(She is just trying to find the woman to see)
All she needs is time
A moment in her mind
While she's in between
She's not a girl
(Not yet a woman)See The Baseballs LiveGet tickets as low as $53You might also likeEmbed
