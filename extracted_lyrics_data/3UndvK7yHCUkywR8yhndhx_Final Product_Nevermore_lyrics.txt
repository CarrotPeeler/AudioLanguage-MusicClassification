3 ContributorsFinal Product Lyrics
The media loves the latest tragic suicide
They exploit it, then package it
And profit from the people who die

Look at the world, look at the hell
Look at the hate that we've made
Look at the final product:
A world in slow decay

I'm told that all your seeds
Are black
I've learned the question is unanswered
And opaque


We're witnessing a famine of the innocent
Did they die for religion or the government?
Because if your god won't do
Their god will starve you

Look at the world, look at the hell
Look at the hate that we've made
Look at the final product:
A world in slow decay
You might also like
I'm told that all your seeds
Are black
I've learned the question is unanswered
And opaque

There are those that believe
The world is ending again
That impending Armageddon
Is inevitable and waiting


The last survivor, barely breathing
Should I run or will I fall?
How have I survived at all?


I'm told that all your seeds
Are black
I've learned the question is unanswered
And opaque

We live in a time of revolution
We swim the silent seas of sanity goneEmbed
