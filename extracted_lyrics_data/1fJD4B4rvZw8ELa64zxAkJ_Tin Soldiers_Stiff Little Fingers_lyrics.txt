7 ContributorsTin Soldiers Lyrics

He joined up to get a job
And show he wasn't scared
Swapped boy scout hat for army cap
He'd finally be prepared
At the age of 17, he was forced to choose
At the age of 21, he's in Catch 22
Hey

He joined up for just three years
It seemed a small amount
But they didn't tell him
That the first two didn't count
At the age of 17, how was he to know
That at the age of 21, he'd still have one to go?

Tin soldier
He signed away his name
Tin soldier
No chance for cash or fame
Tin soldier
Now he knows the truth
Tin soldier
He signed away his youth
See Stiff Little Fingers LiveGet tickets as low as $77You might also like
He joined up, 'cos Dad knew best
To do right by his son
And now he hates and counts the dates
That mark time on square one
At the age of 17, did as he was told
Now at the age of 21, tin still won't turn to gold

Tin soldier
He signed away his name
Tin soldier
No chance for cash or fame
Tin soldier
Now he knows the truth
Tin soldier
He signed away his youth

If at the age of 17, you fall in line too soon
Then at the age of 21, you'll still march to their tune
Hup two three four
Hup two three four
Hup two three four

Tin soldiers
You sign away your name
Tin soldiers
No chance for cash or fame
Tin soldiers
Now you know the truth
Tin soldiers
You sign away your youth
Tin soldiers
You go and join the queue
Tin soldiers
Do what they want you to
Tin soldiers
They take away your name
Tin soldiers
They treat you all the same
Sign away your life
Sign away your lifeEmbed
