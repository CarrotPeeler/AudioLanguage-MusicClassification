3 ContributorsHard Times Lyrics
Close your eyes
And rest your tired body next to mine
Nobody knows more than you
These hard times that we're living through

But baby, we'll go on and on
Lord knows, we've got each other
So kiss me, hard & long
Hard times we can get over, yeah

Now son, hate must dies
With her bags of tricks, of cheats and dirty lies
Nobody smiles and nobody cries
And no one seems to care if they live or die

But baby, we'll go on and on
God knows, we've got each other
So come on, kiss me, hug and love, yes
Hard times we can get over

Ballots and boxes, bullets and guns
And the outlaw always rides in front
But baby, just you come to me
