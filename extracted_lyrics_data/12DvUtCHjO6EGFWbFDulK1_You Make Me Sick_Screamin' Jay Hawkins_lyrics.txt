1 ContributorSLAP Lyrics
Slap, yeaaaah, uh, Slap
To the bass yeah, uhhhh
On the chase yeah
Look, Everyday yeah
It ain't no way

Okay, bitch I'm on fire
Ain't shit that you can tell me
Won't stop 'til we ballin'
Money tall like Wizard Kelly
Rapping, cruising in a Buick
Instrumentals from my celly
Freestyling, cigarillo smoke
Is deep inside my belly, woah
Understand, I'm just rapping 'cause I fucking can
Industry full of bitches, feel like the fucking man
Hundred Grand, I could make that with my fucking hands
All I need's a pen and pad, reason, and a couple grams
Undefeated is my hoodie and my mind state
I'm walking with a ten, your bitch is ugly like a blind date
Stacking paper 'cause they loving how I do this shit
The flow is easier than grandmothers getting bruises is
I give these people bars bitch
Ask and they got em
Shake the game I'll make you fakers fall like autumn
Got these girls running back and forth
Playing keep away
You can keep the dame
We getting change like a meter maid
You might also like
Used to be the little homie
Feeling like the big dog
Getting bigger every time we let a hit drop
Heard you got bars bruh
Why you all lip-locked?
Diamond on my arm, that's a wrist watch
I make a killing in my city, then I bring it back
And we got P's little homie, we don't need your grams
Bitch big titties, heard that daddy had a million
Burning Peter Pan down in Never Never land
Throw my dukes up, get my fam a new palace
Beat on slap, call it fucking brain damage
Pussy ass haters, ain't even worth a adlib
Probably coming up way bigger than some rap shit
Say we gon' ride to this (yeah)
Trying to fuck on something super fly to this
Now feel the bass slap, come on baby slide them hips
Then bring it back to me, come around live as shit

Seen she down to grind to the bass (SLAP)
Heard she wanna ride, we on the chase (SLAP SLAP)
Seen we out here shining everyday (SLAP)
Heard we coming up, It ain't no way (SLAP SLAP)
2x
Okay I'm smoking something super loud
I can't hear them fucking haters
Dreams of moving stupid crowds
Stadiums and XL papers
Music over everything the motherfucking motto
Call me Kordell Stewart, I'm quarterbacking Colorado
You already know the name, Future Hero Kids
Breaking in the nearest cribs
Making sure they hear this shit
Screamin' Jay Hawkins on the stage
Getting weird and shit
Quarantine the flow, other rappers can't come near this shit
It's sick, bet my shit is ill
I think my city starting to love me
Said my shit is real
Drop a couple tracks we made for free
I swear that shit's a steal
It's nothing, trying to get the circle moving like a wheel
Fuck it, tell 'em how we feel
We getting bigger everyday
I don't even need to try, they fuck with everything I say
Steady on the grind, I know my time is on the way
Get it in the first take, Mickey Mantle at the plate
Boy I'm feeling great
Told 'em how we coming up
Can't nobody hold me down
Locked up in the stu'
Thats why I'm blue around the eyes now
Money green sacks just to show that I've arrived now
Know that's how we do it, why that come as a surprise now?
I keep 'em glad 'cause my zips locked
Throw a couple grams
Feeling hot 'cause my shit knock
Bitch so bad and Im'a fuck her 'til my dick soft
Shit straight rock
Take a motherfucking dip mah
Holla 'cause we happenin'
And always get it crackin'
If I ain't rappin'
I probably be mackin'
We been coming up but getting sick of all this practice
Seen we in fashion, like lights, camera, action (slap)

Seen she down to grind to the bass (SLAP)
Heard she wanna ride, we on the chase (SLAP SLAP)
Seen we out here shining everyday (SLAP)
Heard we coming up, It ain't no way (SLAP SLAP)
