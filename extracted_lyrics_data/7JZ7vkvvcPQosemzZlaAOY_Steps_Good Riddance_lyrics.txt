2 ContributorsSteps LyricsWhen I beat my head against the wall of convention
The blood I taste is everyone's
I fought a battle thought unpopular
For stakes nobody seems to see
Nobody sees but me
One step forward
Two steps back
Come on and try me
My pain is the pain of children
My heart is burning with their shame
When mother cries all day
I'll wipe those tears away
You can't grow up healthy in a house of
For every father holding back the angry fire until five
When it festers on the drive
His boss has shamed him to tears
He should "take it like a man" but he never had a man to tell himYou might also likeEmbed
