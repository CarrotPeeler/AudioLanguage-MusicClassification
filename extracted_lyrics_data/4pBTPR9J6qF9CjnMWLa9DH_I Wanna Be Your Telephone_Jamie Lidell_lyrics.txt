2 ContributorsI Wanna Be Your Telephone LyricsBreathe into my mouthpiece baby
Press your cheek against me honey
Push my buttons with your tender touch
Whisper to me till I can't get enough
I wanna be your telephone
I wanna be your telephone
I wanna be your telephone
All the things you say
Always in your pocket, never far away
I'd know all you could say
Share your ups and downs, joys and dismays
I wanna be your telephone
I wanna be your telephone
I wanna be your telephone
If you ever drop me in a puddle
I know you'd treat me so kind
Brush me off and wipe me down
Even though one day you'll trade me for a faster kind
I don't care
I don't mind, no
I wanna be your telephone
I wanna be your telephone
