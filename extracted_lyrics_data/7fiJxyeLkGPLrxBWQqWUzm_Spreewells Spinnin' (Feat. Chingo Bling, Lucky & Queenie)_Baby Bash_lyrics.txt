Spreewells spinnin'
My Spreewells spinnin' on chrome
The spreewells keep spinnin'
And my trunks on pop

My Spreewells spinnin' on chrome
The spreewells keep spinnin'

Ese keep right, I ain't playin' with them

Coup, drop down, while you see the Spreewells spin
Ese choppin' it up
Got the Henny in the cup
Clean white tee, {*guns*} tucked, and I ain't givin' {*a fuck*} (Uh uh)
Pink diamonds for the wifey, fifteen carots for the soldiers
Truck glowed to the {*white*}, two point two, pearly boulders
And I'm still sunned out
Moon roof
To the back, {*blunt*} fill a {*kush*}, blowin' it out
Rob jewels like electric guitars
{*Gang*} signs to the sky
Like I'm tryin' to shoot the stars
And when I say what I do, when I say, what I done
You don't wanna see me back the {*gun*}, ese {*gun cocked*}

Now that's them comin' with them Playa Made Mexicans
That's Baby Bash, on that ass, stackin' presidents
Some call it feddi, scrilla, cash, money, Benjamins
I'm in the zone, off that chrome, in your residents
Look like I'm skatin'
Big, ballin' and heavy weightin'
The trunk, rattlin'
Look at that, the speaker's quakin'
And I ain't fakin' like half
The rappers in the nation
So many trees, look at the leaves, that I be rakin'
And like inflation, I'm bubblin' up to get the bacon
With a pound of {*dank*} and a gang of drank, why y'all procrastinatin'
I'm off the cover, yeah
A fighter and a lover
You want some sauce, come see ya boss
About some butter

Chop, chop
You know it don't stop
The Spreewells keep spinnin'
And my trunks on pop
Chop, chop
You know it don't stop
The Spreewells keep spinnin'
And my trunks on pop
I stay ridin' clean, and droppin' screens
Yellow diamonds all on my ring
Keep some styled on my team
{*Heats*} are under my driver seat
Dabbin', spinnin', like my head
After I done popped a necks
Lucky, yeah, I'm from the wreck
Tell 'em folks to cut a check
Likes to get my floss on
{*Nigga*}, I'm a boss, hun
Ten thousand on chrome
Paper grew and got long
Ain't {*shit*} rented, boy I pimpin', been pimpin'
My rims paid for {*fuckin'*} A.O.B
In H-Town, or on Richmond, gettin' chippers out a stripper
Mex'cans stayed throwed, and the game ain't free
Wheels spin like ceiling fans, woodgrain up in my hands
.45 to the sand, pocket full of Benjamins

You see those mud tractor tires? (Chingo Bling, {*culero*})
You don't want no beef with mine and snap
Doo-doo-doo

This ain't no Bappin' Ape shoes, this is Chingo Bling boots
Your baby mama wippin' down my wetback with tissues
Bought a old school
Had to throw some orange on that hoe
Bought a eighteen wheeler, had to throw some birds on that hoe
Ese like that
Fifth wheel, on relax
Slangin' muscle like {*crack*}
Last name, on the back
Got the four fours spokin'
Candy paint soakin'
H-Town to Mexico
Backed up to Oakland
At night time, I'm loc'in'
I got my cowboy hat
Grillin' women, stove and oven
Maza, I'm a double that
They lookin' for me cause they don't like beaners
How much nalga can I pull, if I ride these spinners

Ladies and gentlemen
Introducing
The largest rims
In all of North America
On chrome

My Spreewells spinnin'
My Spreewells spinnin'
The Spreewells keep spinnin' (My Spreewells spinnin')
And my trunks on pop (Spinnin', spinnin' on chrome)
My Spreewells spinnin'
My Spreewells spinnin'
The Spreewells keep spinnin'
And my trunks on pop (On chrome)
My Spreewells spinnin'
My Spreewells spinnin'

Chop, chop
You know it don't stop
The Spreewells keep spinnin'
And my trunks on pop
Chop, chop
You know it don't stop
