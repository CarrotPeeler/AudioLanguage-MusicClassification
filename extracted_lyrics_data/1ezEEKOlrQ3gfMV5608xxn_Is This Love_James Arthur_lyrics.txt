7 ContributorsIs This Love? Lyrics
I must've walked these streets about a million times
I thought I knew them well but maybe I was blind
'Cause everything's brand new
Thought I knew my heartbeat but it was out of time
It's like my lungs are opening for the first time
Ever since I met you
And I'm on my way now

Is this love, really love?
Is this love, really love?
Ohhh ohhh

I swear that I was heading down a darker road
You got through my guard when I was in safety mode
Darling, you're such a view
You're burning down my walls like the Miami sun
You're the one to blame, you hold a smoking gun
So take your aim and shoot
And I'm on my way now

Is this love? Really love?
Is this love? Really love?
I need to know, need to know
'Cause I've never been this close
Is this love, is this love?
Really love, really love?

So all these demons I'm letting go
'Cause I can see what is beautiful
It finally feels like I'm coming home

Is this love? Really love?
Is this love? Really love?
I need to know, need to know
'Cause I've never been this close
Is this love, is this love?
Really love, really love?

And all these demons I'm letting go
'Cause I can see what is beautiful
It finally feels like I'm coming home3Embed
