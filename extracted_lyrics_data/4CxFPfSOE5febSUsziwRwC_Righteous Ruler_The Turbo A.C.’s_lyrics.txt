1 ContributorIntro / 7 Colors (Siete Colores) Lyrics(Grand Nexus)
Flying out of Napoli
Had fantasies, tapestries
Now we practically Factory art
Practice full court
I'm mashed up on daiquiris
Patented cracks of
Iraqi alchemy trips
The whole faculty grip
Oh my god
We lace the galaxy quick
Pour antacid into anatomies
Check for patterns of mastic vanity
Shit
What I do
Need a turbo to spool
You know the Boro school the verbal
Only 8 cylinder Coupes
Lex my furlough
Decked out in a fur 'Lo
This time it's not for sport yo
You or ya mans
No difference to me
Stick to da plan, G
Leave all for show
Give you neckties
Colombo of rap
Never fed ties
Sons got bedtimes
Catching wreck, I'm
The best that's ever done it
Coming from lands
That's packing currents
Urban mans
The Merchants
Off White the servant
My life
Become a circuit
See serpents
Shaped in a circle
Leave ya camp internment
All comp
Leave no tournament
It's over
Let it go

(Grand Nexus)
The Vincents is bred invincible
Lincolns lock with the rockets
We launch at zippers and boots
That aim to dribble my youth
The game is scribbled in cursive
I'll rid and cripple a group who
Pursuit of purchasing diamonds
Exceed they purpose for truth
Realize what I wake up with
Especially when they waitin' on my paper
Sealed and taped with letterheads
No recollect address
Gather in a deficit
No one fill the form that I master
No basketball team could show up my pass
High performance the dream
Roads they proposed me
Feature curvatures that show me turns from suburbs
Headed quick to the Bridge
I'm last to the first
I count that every verse surpass the amount of
Passing Murcielagos
'Zuki throttle
1000 model
Never trust a pot of gold
I'm holding onto things
That lock ya socks up when the morning show
Clark Wally's hit the ottoman
Closed circuit video and
Judges on TV asking for visuals of lockup
For they plea
Check the record with a microscope
Dodge 10, the Viper smoke
Until my scope of rap
Match my motor game
My corner fame
Heat seek peel off the same
So any man immune make my tribune
I'll lead 'em out the East
Hit the trail of tears
No avenue is grander than the man
That stand and blam at the fools
Who disrespect the manner rules
Rent you out to grammar schools
Palisades and many men
Sinners masquerade
Brandishing metal
Shaving faded melanin
Off ya melon
Who pretend with me?
(Ceven)
Word to my narcoleptic style
Keeps me aware of the dark
Vivid thoughts
I paint the picture like I'm Rembrandt
Engrave these lines in the tomb of your memory
With my left hand
Wild obscure
We tour the land with pockets of celadon
Ducking cases
Quran phrases
Place the truth upon my nation
Lesson 120 confirmed assassinations
7 colors paint my train of thought
The world waits in
For God's statements
Live from the basements
Golden shelves
Bless the chosen 12
Peace cerulean skies
My eyes seek the truest guide to wealth
My opposition come disguised as help for me
But I stand amongst the shadows
In my snow beach Sauconys
Grace the kelly green
Reign the 3rd world
Follow cash
Law don't intervene
The math I walk
The path of the righteous
Word to righteous man
Connect minds from here to Cyprus lands
My clan 10K deep
I write the book Anabasis
Rap Xenophon
Retreat to the Black Sea
Drop jewels
Share my degrees amongst peers
Survival of the fittest
I fear it's all business here
Far and few
The real is scarce
All I learned in these 23 years, son
Beware
Of whatever happens
But take my silver chalice colored ashes
I belong in red top hour glassesEmbed
