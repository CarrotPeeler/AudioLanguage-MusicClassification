We had a good thing goin'
But it couldn't last
We had a good thing goin'
But now it's just a thing of the past

Love took a long time growin'
But then it turned bad
You've got no way of knowin'
Just how much I'm missin' all the love we had

Well, I know that you don't want me any longer, baby
But my love for you keeps gettin' stronger, baby
Even though you're gone
I can't keep from hangin' on

'Cause we had a good thing goin'
So, don't let it end
Let's save our love by showin'
We can get that good thing goin' again

A good thing goin'
A good thing goin'
A good thing goin'
You might also like
We had a good thing goin'
So, don't let it end
We'll save our love by showin'
We can get that good thing goin' again

We can get that good thing goin' again
(We can get that good thing goin' again)
We can get that good thing goin' again
(We can get that good thing goin' again)
We can get that good thing goin' again
(We can get that good thing goin' again)
We can get that good thing goin' again
(We can get that good thing goin' again)
We can get that good thing goin' again
(We can get that good thing goin' again)
We can get that good thing goin' again
(We can get that good thing goin' again)
We can get that good thing goin' again
(We can get that good thing goin' again)
We can get that good thing goin' again
(We can get that good thing goin' again)
We can get that good thing goin' again
(We can get that good thing goin')Embed
