1 ContributorI Want You Babe LyricsWhat's up my boy that I feel so lonely today
What's up my boy, I had to start all over again
Stay on what you just said to me
And whipe that grin of your face boy
Feel this pain is everywhere
And all your words, oh it hurts boy
Oh I want you babe and I need you babe so stay that night
I'm crying babe and I love you babe so hold me tight
Oh I want you babe and I need you babe so stay that night
I'm crying babe and I love you babe so hold me tight
Oh baby, it hurts that much
What's up my love, my wild fancies have all been pushed home
What's up my love, I don't get a wink of sleep
I feel my heart but I've lost my body
I curl my lips at your dirty words
I put it down to ignorance
But that hurts even more
What's up my love - oooooh
What's up my love
Oh I want you babe and I need you babe so stay that night
I'm crying babe and I love you babe so hold me tight
You might also likeAnd I want you babе
Stay on what you just said to me
And whipe that grin of your face boy
Feel this pain is еverywhere
And all your words, oh it hurts boy
Oh I want you babe and I need you babe so stay that night
I'm crying babe and I love you babe so hold me tight
I want you babe and I need you babe so stay that night
I'm crying babe and I love you babe so hold me tight
And I want you babe and I need you babe so stay that night
I'm crying babe and I love you babe so hold me tight
Oh I want you babe and I need you babe so stay that night
I'm crying babe and I love you babe so hold me tight
Oh baby, it hurts that much
Hey - what's upEmbed
