2 ContributorsSail Away LyricsI asked her, her name
She said it was Jane
Oh how I thought that's a beautiful name
What brings you here to sit by the sea
Someone is painting a portrait of me
And as I sit in this old wicker chair
Knitting a scarf for my sister to wear
And watching the sailboats sail in the breeze
I'm thinking of home and my good family
Sail away, taking a holiday
Sail away, taking a holiday
The blue in the sky was the blue in her eye
And the color of her hair was brown
And as she turned I saw was the same
The color of her face and the sun going down
Sail away, taking a holiday
Sail away, taking a holiday
Sail boats painting the sea
Look at the sails wide and free
Grey sky at night a sailor's delight
You might also likeIt's been many years since I have been to the sea
Watching the sailboats sailing the breeze
And finding myself in an old part of town
Looking for faces that just on the ground
There she sits in that old wicker chair
Knitting a scarf for her sister to wear
I don't think I'll ever remember her name
But there on the wall just exactly the same
Sail away, taking a holiday
Sail away, taking a holidayEmbed
