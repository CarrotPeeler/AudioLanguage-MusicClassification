6 ContributorsDance With The Devil LyricsOne music, one rhythm, one feeling, one love
One leader, one voice, one moment, one song
One dream, one hope, one faith, one love
Together we conquer our planet with DANCE!
We give you the music, the rhythm of life
One city, one nation, the power of love
A feeling, a hope, that we become one
Together we conquer our planet with DANCE!
One dream, one voice, one moment, one song
I hear it, I feel it, still believe that we're one
I give you a chance to take the control
Together we conquer our planet with DANCE!
One music, one rhythm, one feeling, one love
One leader, one voice, one moment, one song
One dream, one hope, one faith, one love
Together we conquer our planet with DANCE!
When we dance we want the music loud
We give heaven and hell
You know it's the only way for you
Let your senses guide you throughYou might also likeEmbed
