5 ContributorsIf You Donâ€™t Come Back Lyrics
Well, a noise woke me up this morning
I looked through the Venetian blind
The car was gone and you were gone
And I almost lost my mind

If you don't come back (If you don't come back)
Well, if you don't come back today, baby (If you don't come back today)
Well, you can call up the people at the crazy house
And take this crazy man away

I threw myself up against a wall, now
I tore my clothes and I sobbed
I ran out on the street in my stocking feet
Yelling, "Police, I've been robbed"

If you don't come back (If you don't come back)
Well, if you don't come back today, baby (If you don't come back today)
Yeah, you can call up the people at the crazy house
And take this crazy man away

Mrs. Brown been talking about me
To the people way across the street
She said, "I cooked that boy, now, a bucket of stew
But the poor thing just won't eat"

If you don't come back (If you don't come back)
Well, if you don't come back today, baby (If you don't come back today)
Yeah, you can call up the people at the crazy house
And take this crazy man away

Oh, the doctor came up to see me
He checked me with a fine-tooth comb
He says, "You ain't sick, but you're gonna die
If you don't get your baby back home"

If you don't come back (If you don't come back)
Well, if you don't come back today, baby (If you don't come back today)
Yeah, you can call up the people at the crazy house
And take this crazy man away

If you don't come back (If you don't come back)
If you don't come back today, baby (If you don't come back today)
If you don't come back today (If you don't come back)Embed
