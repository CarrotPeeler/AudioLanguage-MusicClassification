2 ContributorsGhân of the Woods LyricsMoves of the deer
Senses of the beast
Ancient people among the trees
Soil of their land
The way of the wind
Throne and the walls for the Woses
Be gone Orc-folk
Ruin Gorgûn
Be gone troll-folk
Kill Gorgûn
Gold from the sun
The wealth of the clan
Riches of soul for everyone
Rivers and lakes
The silvering moon
Kingdom of pearls their woods
Drain the hope from the souls
Of orcish hordes when they are dead
Drain the life from their own earth
From the stars, from the every birth
Druadan chieftain
Ghân-buri-Ghân
Wise from his mind
Pure from his heart
Druadan chieftain
Ghân of the Woods
Fighting the wolves
Fighting the Gorgûn
