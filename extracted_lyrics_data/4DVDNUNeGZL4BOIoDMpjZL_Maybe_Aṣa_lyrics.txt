2 ContributorsMaybe Lyrics
Maybe, maybe the sun will rise
Maybe, maybe (Ooo...)
Maybe, maybe the stars will shine
Maybe, maybe...

This world is full of pain
Users and their useless ways
There's people dying everywhere
Can't someone tell me who's to blame?

There never used to be
This much attention to security
Until the terror and catastrophe
And now there's guns and war machines


No one is listening
To the truth or is it just me?
I guess I must begin from now
To make that change I always speak about
You might also like
I am waiting for one day to succeed
To break down all the boundaries and be free
From those who take from me and mislead me
For they're greedy and they're empty oh-oh-oh!


My feet, my strength
I'm gonna, be myself
And nobody can, nobody can stop me
I'll finally be, who I'll be
Woah-oh-oh-woah!


She worked
Will I ever be who that I want to be
Without you looking at me like a wannabe
We're gonna have to be
Who that I want to be
Without you looking at me like a wanna be

Oh, maybe, maybe, oh!
So maybe, maybe...
Maybe though
I'm gonna be out here
Yea-ooo...!
No, no, no-ooo!
Ye-aah, yea..., yay
Uma, uma, uma-yaEmbed
