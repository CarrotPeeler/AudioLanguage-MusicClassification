3 ContributorsInside the Torn Apart LyricsInside the torn apart
Feeding on the lies
Lair of sedition
Perverse incubation
Live through this
Love through this... hate this!
Learn from this
Break through this... hate this!
Crisis-spawning decadence
Trial or tribulation
Grotesque imitations
Bleed the rumors drySee Napalm Death LiveGet tickets as low as $55You might also likeEmbed
