What to do
Let Mr Peter Adams : get acquainted with you
Well you won't have to go : well you won't have to go
You can get what you want to : right here in my liquor
Store
He got a little whiskey : he got a little gin
All you got to do : is step in the back end
I met Mr Peter : down on Monroe Street
Come to Fourth Street : right around with me
He got some on his floor : he got some on his shelf
All you got to do : is just to help yourself
Mr Peter Albert : the discount man
You ask him for a favor : he won't make you ashamedYou might also likeEmbed
