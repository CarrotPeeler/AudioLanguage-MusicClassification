2 ContributorsEasy Money LyricsPeverett - Riff Bros. Music - ASCAP
Lookin' for a way to earn some easy cash
So I can lay back and watch it roll in
I wanna flash my roll
I want to see that good old eagle grin
Lonely man needs a high rollin' woman
That's what I had for sure
But she took a ride, left me dissatisfied
Ain't gonna say no more
Easy money, can't get it out of my mind
Easy money, ain't it hard to find!
Cruisin' along on a downtown avenue
I'm lonely, but the night is young
I got money to burn, I had to work to earn
It'll soon be gone
I found the right club, struttin' in, paid the man a dollar
Eased myself into a place at the bar
I drank a double shot, put me in the slot
I'm feeling good so far
Easy money, can't get it out of my mind
Easy money, ain't it hard to find

That's what I had for sure
But she took a ride, left me dissatisfied
Ain't gonna say no more
I been lookin' for a way to earn some easy cash
So I can lay back and watch it roll in
I wanna flash my roll
I want to see that good old eagle grin
Easy money, can't get it out of my mind
Easy money, ain't it hard to find
