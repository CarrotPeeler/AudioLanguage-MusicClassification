4 ContributorsHigher Stakes LyricsThe stakes were higher from the start
The stakes were loaded from the start
You came alone when you came around
But I made no sound
You keep along in the city drum
And you didn't mind
But you were always on your own
And you freed my mind
You were laden when you came around
But I made no sound
When I asked good to see ya but
Just wanna tell that I swear I'm fine
I don't lose my mind anymore
It's not a problem but I
Just wanna tell you that I swear I'm fine
And I don't lose my mind anymore
And it seems that I left my heart
Outside your door
It seems I left my heart
Outside your door
And this is where the hole on me inside
It's alright, I swear that I feel I'm fine
And this is where the hole on me inside
It's alright, I swear that I feel I'm fine

But I waited for darkness to fill my light
When I asked good to see ya but
Just wanna tell you that I swear I'm fine
I don't lose my mind anymore
It's not a problem but I
Just wanna tell you that I swear I'm fine
And I don't lose my my mind anymore
It seems I left my heart outside your door
It seems I left my heart outside your door
And time laid off in the deep blue sea
And everything aligned for inside of me to be
And time may know what you mean to me
And time it goes, it goes and it flows
(Oooh, oh, oh...)
It's a broken heart 
And it's time I fixed myself for you
And it's time I fixed myself before youEmbed
