Mek we know where we going
Shake ya limbs to da rhythms hymns and poems
Shake ya limbs to da rhythms hymns and poems
Mek we know where we going
Shake ya limbs to da rhythms hymns and poems
Work it out
And they say they're trying to work it out
But they dont know just how or why
And it really seems preordained
And my friends are far away
And I wonder if they're ok
And I wonder if the times have changed
And I thought that I saw your face
Are you safe?
Shake ya limbs to da rhythms hymns and poems
Mek we know where we going
Shake ya limbs to da rhythms hymns and poems
From the beginning there was war and sinning
And it seems like nothing has changed
Bombs are dropping on Iraq and Lebanon
(Its like) Vietnam all over again
Days ago a bredrin that I know
Tell me dat he cyan tek no more
Bombs are dropping on Iraq and Lebanon
And everywhere it seems like war
You might also likeAnd they say they're trying to work it out
But they dont know just how or why
And it really seems preordained
And my friends are far away
And I wonder if they're ok
And I wonder if the times have changed
And I thought that I saw your face
Are you safe?
From now on I'm not fighting fair
Its guerilla warfare
It's been 400 years of my people's tears
I'm like Shaka with a hungry spear
Asilwe ke, ng'fikile ke (let's go ahead and fight, I have arrived)
Mina ng'uqhaqha 'maqiniso, uBaba ung'biza uCath'impi (I'm the truth revealer, my father calls me Fighter Instigator)
UBhambhatha Ka Manciza lo ongijoja ngomkhonto (the one who pierced me with a spear)
Once a slave and now a brave
I got my army in the cave
Asilwe ke, ng'fikile ke (let's go ahead and fight, I have arrived)
And they say they're trying to work it out
But they dont know just how or why
And it really seems preordained
And my friends are far away
And I wonder if they're ok
And I wonder if the times have changed
And I thought that I saw your face
Are you safe?
And they say they're trying to work it out
But they dont know just how or why
And it really seems preordained
And my friends are far away
And I wonder if they're ok
And I wonder if the times have changed
And I thought that I saw your face
Are you safe?
