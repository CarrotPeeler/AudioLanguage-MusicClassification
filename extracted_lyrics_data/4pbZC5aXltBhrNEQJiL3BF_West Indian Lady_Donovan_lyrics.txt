5 ContributorsWest Indian Lady Lyrics
Can I be of assistance, my love?
Sha-la-la-la, la, la, la-la, la
I will help you out into the room
Sha-la-la-la, la, la, la-la, la

And you know what I'm thinkin'
Very soon we will be a-drinkin'

From the cup of joy you have brought
From the cup of joy the lady brought
I see you brought your bow along also
Sha-la-la-la, la, la, la-la, la

Is the arrow for me, love?
Well, very soon I think I'll know

If I'll ever return from in her eyes
Sha-la-la-la, la, la, la-la, la
Even in the dark they hypnotise
Sha-la-la-la, la, la, la-la, la
You might also like[Chorus}
