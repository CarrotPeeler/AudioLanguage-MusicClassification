1 ContributorHolly LyricsHolly likes the local color
Six of one is half a dozen of the other
I've seen her
Walking home alone
Lookin' at her phone
Missing curbs
Without
Without
Without the net she thinks is under her
Oh, boom
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom
If nights are dead in the Gold Room
You could always take a swerving drive, well
When you hear the shots
They come two, three at a time
Friends say "Those are other lives
Certainly not mine
Certainly not mine"
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom
Boom, boom, boom
