Ah

GOT DAT LEAN ON ME
GOT DAT LEAN ON ME
GOT DAT LEAN ON ME
GOT DAT LEAN ON ME UH
GOT DAT LEAN ON ME NOW ITS BOUT TO SPILL
CHOSE THIS LIFE CAUSE I TOOK THE RED PILL
MILLION WAYS TO GET MONEY HOW YOU BROKE STILL
FEEL LIKE JUICE WRLD HOW THIS SHIT GETTIN TOO REAL
SWIPER NO SWIPING EXPLORIN HOW IM FINNA STEAL
DEVIL PUT OUT HIS HAND ASKIN DEAL OR NO DEAL
BIG MAYBACH WITH THE ROOF MISSING

OFF THA WHOLE BOTTLE HENNY ROOM SPINNING
LIKE A SWITCH BLADE YOU CAN HEAR ME CLICKIN
KNOW THE OUTCOME OF DIS SHIT GOT ME WINNING
SNAKES IN THE GRASS I CAN HEAR EM HISSIN
NOT ON COMPUTERS IMMA LEAVE EM TWITCHIN
CAUGHT EM SLIPPIN ON THA ICE NOW HE GOTTA COLD
KNOW MY SONGS GROWIN ON YOU LIKE ITS SOME MOLD
UH
SWERVIN IN ALL LANES GOIN OFF THE ROAD
ALTER EGO IN THE MIRROR NOT A CLONE

FEEL LIKE JUICE WRLD HOW THIS SHIT GETTIN TOO REAL
SWIPER NO SWIPING EXPLORIN HOW IM FINNA STEAL
DEVIL PUT OUT HIS HAND ASKIN DEAL OR NO DEAL
BIG MAYBACH WITH THE ROOF MISSING

APPLE MACBOOK HOW YOU GOT FLIPPED OVER
HOW IM COLOR BLIND I ONLY SEE GREEN 4 LEAF CLOVER
LAUGHIN ALL THE WAY TO THE BANK FEELIN LIKE IM DA JOKER
IF IT AINT BOUT MONEY IM GETTIN BORED FACE POKER
THINK IM BLOWIN UP LIKE ITS NUCLEAR IM THE HOMER
MIGHT PULL OFF IN A RANGE TRACKIN IN A ROVER
808's KICKIN LIKE HORSE WITH SOME STEEL HOOVES
3 DIMENSIONAL BARS IN THIS BITCH LIKE RUBIX CUBES
STREET FIGHTER SECRET MOVE NOW YO LIFE REMOVED
THIS A NIGHTMARE ON
AY
THIS A NIGHTMARE ON 2SAP STREET YOU BETTA MOVE

SLASH EM LIKE IM FREDDY KRUGER
