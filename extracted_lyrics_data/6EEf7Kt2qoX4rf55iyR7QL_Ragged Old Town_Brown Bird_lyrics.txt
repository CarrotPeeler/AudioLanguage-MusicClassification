2 ContributorsRagged Old Town Lyrics
She's the dying heart of this ragged old town
She done dug her own grave in the rocky soil ground
But now she know she ain’t gonna lay
Down until the wolf has gone away
And the hunter comes around, no one knows what's comin' ’round
And in the golden days of the terrorless time
She never needed anybody around tell her how to keep her worries in line
But now she won't go outside to see
That there ain't no wolf just a boy in the street
Howlin' up into the sky, don't they howl into the sky?

Don't you hear the sound of ghosts comin' from the grave?
Don't you do it like we done when we had our way?
There ain’t no knight, no haunted hero gonna save the day
So get off the floor and be your own before you wither away

And in the cold dark night, creakin’ on wood floors and walls
Paralyzed by the fear of the fright, she won't move a muscle at all
She cries, "Oh Lord, come take me away
Stood all I can now I can’t stand to stay
Send ol' Gabriel down, don't he always come around?"
You might also like
Don't you hear the sound of ghosts comin’ from the grave?
Don't you do it like we done when we had our way?
There ain't no knight, no haunted hero gonna save the day
So get off the floor and be your own before you wither awayEmbed
