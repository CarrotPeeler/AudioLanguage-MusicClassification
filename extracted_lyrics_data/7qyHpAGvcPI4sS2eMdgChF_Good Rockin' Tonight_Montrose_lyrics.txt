4 ContributorsGood Rockinâ€™ Tonight LyricsHave you heard the news? There's good rockin' tonight
I said have you heard the news? There's good rockin' tonight
I'm gonna squeeze you baby just as tight as I can
Tonight you're gonna know I'm a mighty, mighty man
Have you heard the news? There's good rockin' tonight
I'm gonna meet you in the alley out behind the barn
Don't be afraid, I'll do you no harm
Bring along your tap dancin' shoes
Tonight I'm gonna rock away all your blues
Have you heard the news? There's good rockin' tonight
Let down your hair, let's have some fun
Not just a few, but everyone!
Clap your hands and stomp your feet
Get your self up off your seat!
