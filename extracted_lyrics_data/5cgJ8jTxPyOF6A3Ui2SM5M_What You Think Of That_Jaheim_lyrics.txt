4 ContributorsWhat You Think of That LyricsShe was just an ex of a nigga
Who kept her from her fullest potential
Always played games with her mental
And every type of shit to make her self esteem little
But now her days are always so fly
She's a diamond on the rough no lie
I'm rough enough to make the diamond shine
Just like a trophy on my 'pode held high
And now I know, oh I know
And she's good to me, great to me
She crowned me to be the King
Now what you think if that?
Cause she's down for me, my homie, my tangeroni only
Now what you think of that?
'Cause she stay real with me, deal with me, perfect to be my wife
Now what you think if that?
She's beautiful to me and I don't care what you think of that
Now, what you think of that?
Hey
She always keep it at a hundred
Never caught fake, phony, or frontin'
Always show me love when I want it
And never lose her cool over nothing
I admit she a gift no lie
The type of girl that you'd be dumb to pass by
She's a blessin' when she came in my life
And I'm so happy that she's mine, oh mine
I know, Oh I know!

Through the tears on my momma's eyes

And I gotta give you credit, don't sweat it
Its gunna get better, forever you'll have my love
