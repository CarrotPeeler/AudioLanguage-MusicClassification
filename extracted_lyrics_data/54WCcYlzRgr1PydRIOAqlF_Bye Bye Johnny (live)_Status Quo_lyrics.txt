INT. AIRLINER – NIGHT

FLIGHT ATTENDANT (V.O.) : Das Sicherheitsgurtzeichen wird belichtet. Befestigen Sie bitte Ihre Sicherheitsgurte. (then, accented) The captain has turned on the fasten seat belt sign, please make sure your seat belts are securely fastened.

WOMAN: Ich bevorzuge die Serie.
MAN: I don’t—speak German, I’m from Denver.
WOMAN: Weil – dieses mein
MAN: Erstflug ist. - I’m—- I’m from Denver.

INDIAN MAN: My friend. It is just an electrical storm. This will pass.
TROUBLED: I understand.
INDIAN MAN: (offering a pack) Juicy Fruit?
TROUBLED: No. I can’t, I’m fine. Thank you.


INDIAN MAN: - my friend-?

FLIGHT ATTENDANT: Sir, excuse me! You must stay in your seat!

EXT. SKY – NIGHT



EXT. TURNPIKE MOTEL – NIGHT


INT. TURNPIKE MOTEL ROOM – NIGHT


OLIVIA: … oh my God.

MAN (O.S.): - what?
OLIVIA: This bed is ridiculous. It’s like the loudest bed in the history of cheap motel beds.
MAN (O.S.): - and you would know this how?

JOHN: This is so much better than that policy seminar.
OLIVIA: Oh, thank you, a compliment.

JOHN: I was losing my mind, that meeting was endless. I kept finding myself staring at you. I actually had to turn my chair to stop.
OLIVIA: We can’t keep doing this. Sneaking around…
JOHN: The department’s not a massive fan of office romances – as recent events demonstrate.
OLIVIA: Dryden seeing Lynch had nothing to do with why he was demoted-— you don’t see any irony in what we’re doing?
JOHN: Is knowing the assistant manager of the Turnpike motel by name ideal? No. Is being with you worth the subterfuge? Yes.
OLIVIA: I feel like I’m living in a Charlotte Bronte novel. Which is not how I envisioned my early thirties. I think Charlie knows anyway.
JOHN: He doesn’t know.
OLIVIA: I think he does -–
JOHN: If he knew, you’d be transferred.

JOHN (CONT’D): I like Charlie. But if there was ever a by-the-booker, it’s him. He’d let Jakes know faster than you can say “good soldier”. I’m not afraid of transparency—- but we’re already working for a Department that’s as unstable and fluid as they come and somehow? We found each other. And in the madness of what we’ve been seeing lately… I’ve taken great solace in being with you. Now if that’s the kind of information that makes you back away, so be it. ‘Cause this is all preamble to the kicker, which is that I love you. (beat, that was a first) And the idea of an old boy’s club wonder making the call whether or not you and I get to live in the same city is unacceptable to me. So forgive my…furtive nature, it’s got nothing whatsoever to do with protocol or decorum or enjoying the status quo -– this is about you. I don’t want to lose… you.

OLIVIA: Agent Dunham. (listens, sits) Okay. Are there any more details than-? (beat, concern) Yessir.

OLIVIA (CONT’D): Incident at Logan Airport, International flight, Charlie’s on his way.

OLIVIA (CONT’D): Hey, in the spirit of our talk… you should get there a few minutes after me. We arrived pretty close last time.
JOHN: Now you’re being paranoid.
OLIVIA: Maybe – Logan: access gate at Runway 15R

JOHN: Agent Scott.

EXT. LOGAN AIRPORT – NIGHT


OLIVIA: Olivia Dunham, FBI.

CHARLIE: Inter-agency harmony and cooperation continues.
OLIVIA: Who’s winning?
CHARLIE: Langley by a nose. (then, re: jet) Flight out of Hamburg –- hundred and forty-seven passengers, towers lost contact three hours in. Thought there might’ve been some electrical interference, apparently they were flying in a hell of a storm. They entered our airspace radio silent -– Navy scrambled two F-18’s for escort. They reported stains on the windows...and no signs of life aboard the jet.

OLIVIA: Stains?
CHARLIE: Blood.
OLIVIA: I’m surprised they let ‘em land –- “No signs of life” -– who was flying the plane, auto-pilot?
CHARLIE: Programmed to land right on schedule, which it did. Unlike every flight I’ve ever taken.
OLIVIA: If there was a decompression the windows would have frozen solid –- have they opened the cabin?
CHARLIE: White House approved a CDC request for the jet not to be opened until they arrive.

JOHN: let me assure you, we’d be happy to treat you like family too. (hangs up, grins) Good old NTSB. All like to think they’re cops.
CHARLIE: Agent Scott.
JOHN: Agent Francis –- (no special regard) Agent Dunham.

OLIVIA: They must’ve looked in through the windows…
CHARLIE: CIA did. Whatever the hell’s inside that plan made Special Agent McNeary throw up in front of his whole unit. And he’s a good man, that was embarrassing.

BROYLES: Although this is a joint task force, this investigation will be run through HDS – I’m Special Agent in Charge Broyles! DC has sent me here to make sure we get results. As soon as our friends from Atlanta get here we’re going in, one member from each agency on the starting line as follow – (reads a card) CIA: Baronoff! FBI: Francis! DHS: Pitts!
(MORE)
BROYLES (CON’D): Contagion precautions apply: level four HAZ-MAT suits, we should have your size in the van! Move!

OLIVIA: Sir: Olivia Dunham, FBI Inter-agency liaison, I’m EOD and NBC certified, I’d like to suit up too-–
BROYLES: Liaison on an inter-agency task force. Gotta love that. Like powdered sugar on a glazed donut.
OLIVIA: Excuse me, if I’m gonna do my job effectively, I like my information first-hand -– that’s not redundancy, that’s accountability.
BROYELS: (sotto, threatening) I know exactly who you are. You put my best friend in prison two years ago. (she’s stunned, louder:) You want in, Liaison? Suit up.
