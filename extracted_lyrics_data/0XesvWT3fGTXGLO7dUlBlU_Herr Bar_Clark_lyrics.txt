We don't mean to offend you, but that's just the way we are
Hanging out
Hanging out

Having it so bad, well now your lady's got a man
Then you start to do the things you do every day
Hanging in the streets with a UTFO beat
Snap that, Doctor D and you can have it your way
Hanging with the guys, coolin' out and gettin' by
I don't know who askin' for it, it's just the gimmick they play
Hanging out and cooling out and chilling out without a doubt
Just to cry, dirty , only gotta say we're

Hanging out, cooling out, without a doubt
It's all about hanging out
Hanging out and cooling out and chilling out without a doubt
It's all about hanging out
Hanging out, cooling out, without a doubt
It's all about hanging out
Hanging out and cooling out and chilling out without a doubt
It's all about hanging out

Well I was chilling alone on (5th Avenue)
Within five minutes came (Charleston Chew)
And on his arm a girl we call Fatty
Even though her real name (was Peppermint Patty)
Her body was (Chunky), it was like a Goodyear
She had a little crush on the (Three Musketeers)
And no sooner then they left in their vicious car
I met my homeboy, (Mr. Goodbar)
He said he took (Ms. Hershey) to the (Milky Way)
And they had a (Baby Ruth) last year today
I said "Brother you're slick, ain't nobody slicker
You're even worse than (Clark Bar Snicker)"
It was an (Almond Joy) to see the bunch
But I missed my homeboy, (the Nestle Crunch)
But I met this freak, she was a (Bit-Of-Honey)
Her eyes (Starburst) when she saw my money
And (Whatchamacallit), I forgot his name
He was a (Butternut) in every game
Well it's time to leave, time for me to go
So I hollered "(Hubba Bubba)" to let them know
That I had good time when I bust a (Peanut Chew)
On a sweet fine lady they call Suzy Q

Hanging out, cooling out, without a doubt
It's all about hanging out
Hanging out and cooling out and chilling out without a doubt
It's all about hanging out
Hanging out, cooling out, without a doubt
It's all about hanging out
Hanging out and cooling out and chilling out without a doubt
It's all about hanging out

Attention everybody if it's not too much
I'm the Educated Rapper just keepin' in touch
Keep in mind I'm serious about what I say
When it comes to disses I just don't play
My rhymes have to be smart, strikin' you in the heart
I'm not the Educated Rapper girl, just for the part
I can't deny I wanna be with some-B-O-D-Y
I gotta leave a message 'cause I can't let it by
So remember, listen closely, definitely you will find
There's something to be learned written down on the rhyme
You're all invited, (come along), I'll do you no wrong
I want you, and you, and you to come on
Tamaga made of books, you can take some looks
There's something there for everybody, even the crooks
And you will soon see, how really smart you could be
Instead of walking 'round the streets, roaming endlessly
Patience is a virtue, not something there to hurt you
So mention something weak-is, I won't let it serve you
Don't get me wrong, I like hanging out too
I also got my act together, so how about you?
So hang out, and bug out, and keep it in mind
Hard work in due time will bring sunshine!
Hanging out, cooling out, without a doubt
It's all about hanging out
Hanging out and cooling out and chilling out without a doubt
It's all about hanging out
Hanging out, cooling out, without a doubt
It's all about hanging out
Hanging out and cooling out and chilling out without a doubt
It's all about hanging out

In the summertime, (Hanging out 'til 4 AM)
You sleep until it's 9 (Then you do it all again)
You're chillin' most rough (That you can't deny)
Hey life can be tough (But you're still gettin' by)
Don't take it too far (Or you'll be doin' time)
It's all because of y'all (That we got so much crimes)
So when we say (Hanging out) we mean just (Chilling out)
Don't you cry (Close your mouth) It's all about (Hanging out)
So when we say (Hanging out) we mean just (Chilling out)
Don't you cry (Close your mouth) It's all about (Hanging out)
Hanging out, cooling out, don't ya pout, hanging out
Hanging out, cooling out, don't ya pout, hanging out
