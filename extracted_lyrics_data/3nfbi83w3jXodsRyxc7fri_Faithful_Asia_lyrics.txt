3 ContributorsFaithful LyricsSo many faces in my life and time
Couldn't change the way I feel
I was hard wired to forget
To live and love with no regret
And when I stumbled in the darkest night
Just when I thought that there could be no light
You came along, and you should know
Look in my eyes, the truth will show...
I'll be faithful, that's what I do
Ever faithful, my aim is true
Wherever you may go, you'll always know
Faithful I'll be with you
I've been a stray all of my life, you see
I thought nothing would ever change for me
Now I've found you, here I stay
May it always be that way...
'Cause I'll be faithful, that's what I do
Ever faithful, my aim is true
Wherever you may go, you'll always know
Faithful I'll be with you
Wherever you may go, you'll always know
Faithful I'll be with you
You might also likeYou came along and now you know
That I could never let you go
I'll be faithful, that's what I do
Ever faithful, my aim is true
Wherever you may go, you'll always know
I'll be faithful
Ever faithful
Wherever you may go, you'll always know
Faithful I'll be with you
Wherever you may go, you'll always know
Faithful I'll be with youEmbed
