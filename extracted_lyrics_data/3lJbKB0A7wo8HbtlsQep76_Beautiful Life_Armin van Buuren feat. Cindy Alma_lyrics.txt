5 ContributorsBeautiful Life Lyrics
Some people keep wondering
Some people long without knowing
Some people never found the answer, the answer
We finally know how to be free
Let the music, you’re with me
It’s how I feel everything for the first time

It’s such a beautiful, beautiful life
When every day is made of you and I
Oh oh, just close your eyes
And we could dance tonight forever


Some people keep wondering
Some people long without knowing
Some people never found the answer, the answer

It’s such a beautiful, beautiful life
When every day is made of you and I
Oh oh, just close your eyes
And we could dance tonight forever
