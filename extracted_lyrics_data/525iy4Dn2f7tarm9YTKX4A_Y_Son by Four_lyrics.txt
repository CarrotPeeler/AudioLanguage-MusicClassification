1 ContributorY LyricsPeople say and I agree
If something goes away
And it returns it's yours for keeps
But that is not working for me
Every night and every day
I realize that she possesses
Power over me
And only her eyes I can see
Chorus:
And I am just a fool that still believes
In what she promised
To be together till the end
Damn not again
Why I can stop this lie
That everything's all right
That we were gonna last forever
Why it's easier to deny
That all we had just die
To forget you it's now or never
People say and I agree
That with faith you can move
A mountain mentally
There's nothing real it's just a dream
Every night and everyday
Minutes become hours
Days to months and you're not here
My eyes are dry and no more tears

I just wanna know
Why this crazy thing to me just keeps on happening
How can that love of my life
Look into my eyes and tell me pretty lies
I just wanna know
Why this crazy thing to me just keeps on happening
How can that love of my life
Look into my eyes and tell me pretty lies
I'm tired of the game
But I just can't seem to tell you goodbye
Why I can stop this lie
That everything's all right
That we were gonna last forever
Why it's easier to deny
That all we had just die
To forget you it's now or never
Tell me whyEmbed
