3 ContributorsTrapped In Space & Time LyricsI sit alone in a field
It’s hard to filter the things you feel
I let this go with no eyes
I’m trapped in space and I’m trapped in time
Everyday, everyday that you’re gone
Everyday that you’re gone
I dragged myself to the street
There’s no escaping my own defeat
My parents are an unknown
I’m in my house but I can’t find home
Everyday, everyday that you’re gone
Everyday that you’re gone
Five long years
I shoved you out, all of these tears falling
Five long years
To end this drought, now I can hear you calling
What I can’t have I can dream
But there’s a tear across every seam
All that was silver is chrome
All that was spirit is turned to stone
Everyday, everyday that you’re gone
Everyday that you’re gone
Five long years
I shoved you out, all of these tears falling
Five long years
To end this drought, now I can hear you calling
You might also likeSomeone led me from the light
I’ll regret it all my life
Someone led me from the light
I’ll regret it all my life
I cut you out of the deal
I never thought it would be this real
I’m lost inside this design
I’m trapped in space and I’m trapped in time
Everyday, everyday that you’re gone
Everyday that you’re gone
Everyday you’re gone
Everyday you’re gone
Everyday that you’re goneEmbed
