1 ContributorI Need A Lot Of Loving Every Day Lyrics
Oh I need a lot of loving every day, oh yes I do
Yes I need a lot of loving every way
Every minute, every hour
Your love give me power
Yes I need a lot of loving every day

And I require a million kisses every night, oh yeah
And I require a million kisses every night
Kisses when the sun go down
And darling I'm so glad you around
Oh I need a lot of loving every day, oh yes I do

Oh I need your arm around me, baby all the time, yeah
'Cause the love that you give me
Makes me feel so fine
Oh I need, oh yeah
Every day, oh yeah
Yes I need a lot of loving every way

Love that's sweet and warm
Love that makes me strong
Oh I need love
Baby I need love
Early in the morning
When the sun go down
Baby I love you
Baby I love youYou might also likeEmbed
