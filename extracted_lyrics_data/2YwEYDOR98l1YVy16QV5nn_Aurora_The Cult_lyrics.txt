No fucking way bro, holy shit
Jaron what are you doing
I'm telling you where she is in 4K bro
(My gun got a boner bro)
I said I would shoot at her but
I have no soul
(Chorus - VANITAS)
Hit you with that metal just like I'm Edward
Don't fuck with me cuz I got a tiny little temper
You a pussy ass bitch have always been sheltered
That's the type of shit that's gonna get your head severed
Fire fist flow, that's how it goes
It don't get no hoes
But watch me grow, no tippy toes
But I'll reach the throne
You better book, or I'll grab the chrome
Aim it at your dome
Your bitch right here, she read me poems
She licking my foam
(Verse 1 - ...)
Demonize uh, demonize uh
Demonize uh, demonize uh
She wanna hit that steezy uh
You wanna bitch that's easy uh
I got on shit that's drippy yuh
You cannot even please me yuh
Piss on a bitch she nasty yuh
They wanna finger blast me yuh

Export your bitch
Then O import my dick uh
I hit a lick 2 bags of chips
S on my ween
I'm goin knock out all of your teeth bitch
-Verse 2- VANITAS
Rip your fucking jaw off like the rocket
Pull up with the mini rocket up in my pocket
Barrel of my gun get hot like them pockets
Bitch you ain't shit you better just stop it
Bitch I'm a virus, corona
Butterfly knife sting you like a cobra
Blick make your head pop like Boba
Bitch go to sleep like fucking Aurora
Stay in the cut, bacteria
Pussy your shit, we're superior
Making hot shit, chlamydia
Making your organs, your exterior
(Chorus - VANITAS)
Hit you with that metal just like I'm Edward
Don't fuck with me cuz I got a tiny little temper
You a pussy ass bitch have always been sheltered
That's the type of shit that's gonna get your head severed
Fire fist flow, that's how it goes
It don't get no hoes
But watch me grow, no tippy toes
But I'll reach the throne
You better book, or I'll grab the chrome
Aim it at your dome
Your bitch right here, she read me poems
She licking my foam
(Chorus,Slowed - VANITAS)
Hit you with that metal just like I'm Edward
Don't fuck with me cuz I got a tiny little temper
You a pussy ass bitch have always been sheltered
