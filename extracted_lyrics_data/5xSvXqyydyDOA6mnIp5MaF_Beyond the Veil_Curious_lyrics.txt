14 ContributorsThe Legend of Siren Head Lyrics
I'm not crazy, just a little on edge
I've been seein' somethin' in the trees and the hedges
It might be only my fantasies
But I know what I saw (Know what I saw)
I know what I see (I know what I see)
Away in the trees, he's watching me (Watching me)
Getting closer to your curious sounds
Getting darker and darker (Oh-oh) as I'm walking around (Oh-oh)
And every trace of blood I find along the way
Brings me nearer to you (Oh-oh)
Might I die too? (Oh-oh)
What will you do?

Predator so humanoid (Mmm-mmm-mmm)
Sirens wail, I might as well be dead (Oh-oh-oh)
The paranormal makes me paranoid (Mmm-mmm-mmm)
In the detail beyond the veil
It's the urban legend, Siren Head

La-la-la, la-la-la-la (Siren Head)
La-la-la, la-la-la-la

Terror shines through your murderous ways
Could you mimic your prey in the words that you say?
Echoes heard through the forest so deep of the victims you keep
Who struggle to breathe (Who struggle to breathe)
Forever asleep
You might also like
Predator so humanoid (La-la-la, la-la-la-la)
Sirens wail, I might as well be dead (La-la-la, la-la-la-la)
The paranormal makes me paranoid (La-la-la, la-la-la-la)
In the detail, beyond the veil (La-la-la, la-la-la-la)
It's the urban legend, Siren Head

Everyone dies, everyone within your sight (Ah-ah-oh)
Danger, horror, the killer in the night (Ah)
Hiding in a grove of trees before you take a bite (Oh)
Guess scary stories come to life

I'm not crazy, just a little on edge
I've been seein' somethin' in the trees and the hedges

Predator so humanoid
Sirens wail, I might as well be dead (Oh-oh-oh)
The paranormal makes me paranoid (La-la-la, la-la-la-la)
In the detail, beyond the veil (La-la-la, la-la-la-la)
It's the urban legend, Siren HeadEmbed
