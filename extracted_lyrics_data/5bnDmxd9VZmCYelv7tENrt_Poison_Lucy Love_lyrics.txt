Yes im a creeper now clinging to the scraps
I look to every reason not to stick to the tracks
Even though misery's a bitch self-pity attracts
When reality hits the silent truth smacks
My brain distorts the truth and i deny the facts
It's a knife to the heart everytime it attacks
Like a moth to the flame i get chaugt in the traps
I've got venom in my veins
I've got poison in my heart
And all my broken dreams are tearing me apart
I've got poison in my heart
I've got venom in my veins
I've got poison in my heart
And all my shattered dreams are tearing me apart
I've got poison in my heart
I'm getting closer to the edge byt the lights aren't getting brighter
Feel the blood rush to my head i guess i'm feeling lighter
The space is getting smaller the air is getting tighter
Yes i'm the underdog up against the ultimate fighter
My adrenaline is gasoline and i'm in the igniter
My future's carved in stone but im still the rewriter
It's a knife to the heart everytime it attacks
Like a moth to a flame i get caught in the traps
You might also likeI've got venom in my veins
I've got poison in my heart
And all my broken dreams are tearing me apart
I've got poison in my heart
I've got venom in my veins
I've got poison in my heart
And all my shattered dreams are tearing me apart
I've got poison in my heart
Poison in my heart (tearing me up)

Venom, poison
Venom, poison
It's a knife to the heart everytime it attacks
Like a moth to a flame i get caught in the traps
I've got venom in my veins
I've got poison in my heart
And all my broken dreams are tearing me apart
I've got poison in my heart
I've got venom in my veins
I've got poison in my heart
And all my shattered dreams are tearing me apart
I've got poison in my heart
Poison in my heart
