9 ContributorsLost LyricsI lost my wallet
I lost my wallet
And I'm lost, dear
I swear I had it
I had it on me when we got here
Let's go to Vegas
Let's get a karaoke back room
I'll never find it
I wanna shout into the vacuum
That nothing's ever lost forever
It's just caught inside the cushions of your couch
And when you find it
You'll have such a nice surprise
Nothing's ever lost forever
It's just hiding in the recess of your mind
And when you need it
It will come to you at night
Ho!
I miss the yellow
I miss the yelling and the shakedown
I'm not complaining
I got a better set of knives now
You might also likeI miss my drummer
My dead stepbrother
And the pit crowd
And Chuck and Matty
If they could see me, they'd be so proud
But nothing's ever lost forever
It's just caught inside the cushions of your couch
And when you find it
You'll have such a nice surprise
Nothing's ever lost forever
It's just hiding in the recess of your mind
And when you need it
It will come to you at night
The wake is over
We gotta leave because they said so
I want to tell you
I want to tell you
But you're dead, so...
Golden light
So way up high
So wave goodbye
Tonight you'll find
That nothing's ever lost forever
It's just caught inside the cushions of your couch
And when you find it
You'll have such a nice surprise
Nothing's ever lost forever
It's just hiding in the recess of your mind
And when you need it
It will come to you at night
No one's ever lost forever
When they die they go away
But they will visit you occasionally
(Do not be afraid)
No one's ever lost forever
They are caught inside your heart
If you garden them and water them
They make you what you are
No one's ever lost forever
When they die they go away
But they will visit you occasionally
Do not be afraid
No one's ever lost forever
They are caught inside your heart
If you garden them and water them
They make you what you areEmbed
