2 ContributorsI Will Always Ride (Ryde 4 You) Lyrics
I'll... I'll always ride with you...
I'll always ride with you...

Back in the days
She used to hold me down
One time used to move fast she tried to slow me down
She used to call me, write letters when I fall
Send me pics when I was locked behind the walls
She used to be the girl I called on
Always had my back, no matter if I was right or wrong
She always helped me keep my head up
Always kept me motivated took a while to get my bread up
Now that's a rider girl to me
Taking trips late night come & ride with a G
I'll take you places you ain't never been
Sunsetting windows down hair flowing through the wind
Come here you looking so delicous
I wanna take a bite of you
Can I get some candy kisses
You can be a Criminal’s misses
Late night with the Criminal just changing positions
Come & roll with me tonight I'll keep you by my side
I love a girl like you
A girl that’s down to ride
A modern day Bonnie & Clyde in 2008 we going to keep alive
I ride, you ride, so together we ride
Put it down to the day that we die we lie haha
It's just gangster love ride with a G
I'll show you how a gangster does it
You might also like
I will always ride with you
I will live & die for you
If you feel the same way too
Boy I’ll always fight for you

It’s still on & cracking since back in the dayz
I love the way you handle your business girl your feminine ways
I like the way your body reflects all off in the candle light
Call a Criminal freaky, but shit I gotta handle right
Let's handle something later on tonight
Girl let's get freaky only if you ask I might bite
It's not my fault baby girl you’re so attrative
Got me feanin like Jodeci
Nasty like Misses Jackson
After this let's go relaxing kick back on the beach
Watch some waves crushing
Sunsetting off the west
Clear reflection
Perfect timing just for me & you to keep this connection
Come & ride with me let's hit the streets & cruise
Let's bumb some slow jams let's play slow grooves
See I'm a grown man making grown moves
Still keep myself a plan so I won't lose
And I will like for you to be part of it
I know it was right girl since the start of it
It's more than what meets the eye
It's the realist that I feel baby girl
Are you down to ride?
And If some drama hit the fan will you be down to lie?
I promise I will do a lot but I won't make you cry
Come and ride with a G girl
Take you by the hand show you why you’ll never leave girl
I will always ride with you
I will live & die for you
If you feel the same way too
Boy I’ll always fight for you

I will always ride with you...
I will always ride with you...
Mr. CriminalEmbed
