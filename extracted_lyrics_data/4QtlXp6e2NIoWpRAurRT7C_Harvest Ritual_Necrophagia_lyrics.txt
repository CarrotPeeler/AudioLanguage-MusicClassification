1 ContributorHarvest Ritual LyricsTortured cries of the children
Echo from the grave
Starring from the abyss
Screaming out in pain
Chanting hymns
Of dismal euphoria
Sacred words invoked
Fetal communion
Infant ashes ignite
Harvest ritual
Ceremonial corpse vessel
Mummified womb of Satan
Baptized by the fires of Sodom
Rebirth of paradise
