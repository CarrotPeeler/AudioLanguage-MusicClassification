Da-da, da-da, da-da-da
Ah-ha, tripping
I walk to where he's sitting
It's so salty
It's so salty

He knows
It's good, it's real, it's pretty

It's so salty, Timmy
It's so salty, Timmy
It's so salty, Timmy

He said doe
Doe, doe

Dared leave
We've burned the field completely
Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha
Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha
Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha

Last light
I feel it's real, it's pretty

It's so salty, Timmy
It's so salty, Timmy
It's so salty, Timmy

He said doe
Doe, doe4Embed
