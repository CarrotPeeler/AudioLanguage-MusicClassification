6 ContributorsAbsurd (May 21st) LyricsPart 1: Absurd
Crashin' everything for the come up
Stackin' and stackin' and stackin' this guap up
Zoom

I've been in the kitchen whippin' up like Bobby Flay
Damn I just missed two back to back calls from 2 Chainz
Speakers bumpin' T.R.U. Jack City, I might move back to the A
Just to go back to Magic City with PK and make it rain
Full throttle now (zoom)
We got fetti, tell the waitress bring the bottles now
Back in the G I used to stay 'cross from the Waffle House
Oh you ain't heard, bitch we poppin' now
If I say the word she gon' drop it down
What the fuck you lookin' at? Nigga I don't know you
I grew up where they juugin' at and granny cookin' soul food
Starin' at pictures prayin' her son comin' home soon
Seein' the twisters on Brian brother Danny old school
Turned me to a west side nigga, only thing throwin' up
Like that Bedstuy nigga, I had dreams of blowin' up
I had no idea of what an idea could become
I live in my mind and such, plus I do not talk too much
Fuck niggas tellin' anywhere, they run their mouth like girl cousins in the hood
Man that shit absurd, keep it understood
You can't keep it real? That's absurd
I stay off the kill and you stay off the pill? That's absurd
You live with your bitch and she pay all the bills? That's absurd
I show love and pussy niggas hatin' still... that's absurd

Just won't stop 'til the paper on top
And the fader on top, elevator on top
Scarface in the drop, far away from the block
Far away where the neighbors stay far away
And they bring fruit cakes when they knock
And they just walk in cause shit ain't locked
Hit, hit on the J, and my nigga I'm just tryna go pop
I just wanna go shop, for the times I was in the hood
And coulda got shot
Stead I slanged 16s, coulda slanged them rocks
Sellin' still in them zones, I'm just holdin' on to my soul
And sellin' all of these songs
Crashin' everything for the come up
They all owe me a little somethin'
But you tell these niggas it's nothin'
But tell them niggas it's comin'
And tell them niggas if they got a problem
I still got the same number
And I still got the same woman
And yeah, nigga I love her
I'll pay the ransom for her
So if you need that, you need that
I ain't hard to find or get, hope you can't by drift
I'm 'bout to swag now, excuse my drift
Seems to be it's out the bag, now, Gizzle's here
And I done even came down on the price, nigga
We're in the middle here, I'm tryna find someone as hard as me
On 5 I couldn't find anything after all these years
You can't keep it real? That's absurd
I stay off the kill and you stay off the pill? That's absurd
You live with your bitch and she pay all the bills? That's absurd
I show love and pussy niggas hatin' still...

God damn, nigga that's absurd
Niggas makin' absurd claims in the city
They know the truth
They know they ain't fuckin' with me
Not at all
We chargin' activation fees like the beeper store at the mall
Don't give a fuck about y'all
Zoomin'
Might bang on yah like Jordan did Patrick EwingPart 2: May 21st
Broken, broken dreams, broken promises
Politics, young nigga spendin' up his common sense on compliments
There go them niggas in that mall again
There go them niggas on that ballin' shit
Salt stir, I blow a bag full of condiments
Stories that the media feedin' us, no I'm not convinced
War is what we up against, feel like we on the fence
Between riches and righteous, I can't decide to pick
Pomona to Providence, fendin' for survival
Can't open up a Bible but you quick to open bottles
Chasin' freak hoes, hopin' that she swallow
Fuck her for the first time, feelin' like you won the lotto
Twist... all a cycle, they treat you like a psycho
We all gotta go one day, look at Michael
Starin' at the stars, treat 'em like they're idols
Not even knowin' they're suicidal
Lost on a trip far away from home
May God have mercy on my grateful soul
Now this is the part where I make a toast
Cause out of me and my teachers, I made the most
Sky is the limit and you know that you keep on
Just keep on pressin' on
Sky is the limit and you know that you can
Have what you want, be what you want
Sky is the limit and you know that you keep on
Just keep on pressin' on
Sky is the limit and you know that you can
Have what you want, be what you want

Sky is the limit, sky is the
Sky is the limit, baby
Sky is the limit
And you can have what you want
Be what you want, baby
Sky is the limit, baby

Ayo, talk to 'em
Do your thing, young nigga, do your thing
Do your thing, young nigga, do your thing
Pursue your dreams, get that cream
The sky is the limit, you just dream
Come on

I was a shame, my crew was lame
I had enough heart for most of them
Long as I got stuff from most of them
It's on, even when I was wrong I got my point across
They depicted me the boss, of course
My orange box-cutter make the world go round
Plus I'm fucking bitches ain't my homegirls now
Start stacking, dabbled in crack, gun packing
Nickname Medina make the seniors tote my Ni√±as
From gym class, to English pass off a global
The only nigga with a mobile can't you see like Total
Getting larger in waists and tastes
Ain't no telling where this felon is heading, just in case
Keep a shell at the tip of your melon, clear the space
Your brain was a terrible thing to waste

God sent me here to inspire you
If I can do it, you can do it
You gotta stop making them excuses, man
Cause it's nothing you can't do
See, I'm a superhero, you feel me?
(Keep zoomin')
Yeah it's that crazy
You gotta think that crazy to be great
Do your thing, young nigga, do your thing
(Keep zoomin')
Do your thing, young nigga, do your thing
(Keep zoomin')You might also like1Embed
