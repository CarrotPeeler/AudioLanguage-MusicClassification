Nice guys finish last
You're runnin' out of gas
Your sympathy will get you left behind
Sometimes, you're at your best
When you feel the worst
You feel washed up like piss goin' down the drain

Pressure cooker, pick my brain and tell me I'm insane
I'm so fuckin' happy, I could cry
Every joke can have its truth, but now the joke's on you
I never knew you're such a funny guy

Oh, nice guys finish last
When you are the outcast
Don't pat yourself on the back, you might break your spine

Livin' on command
You're shakin' lots of hands
You're kissin' up and bleedin' all your trust
Takin' what you need
Bite the hand that feeds
You lose your memory and you got no shame

Pressure cooker, pick my brain and tell me I'm insane
I'm so fuckin' happy, I could cry
Every joke can have its truth, but now the joke's on you
I never knew you're such a funny guy

Oh, nice guys finish last
When you are the outcast
Don't pat yourself on the back, you might break your spine
Oh, nice guys finish last
When you are the outcast
Don't pat yourself on the back, you might break your spine
Ooh


Oh, nice guys finish last
When you are the outcast
Don't pat yourself on the back, you might break your spine
Oh, nice guys finish last
When you are the outcast
Don't pat yourself on the back, you might break your spine5Embed
