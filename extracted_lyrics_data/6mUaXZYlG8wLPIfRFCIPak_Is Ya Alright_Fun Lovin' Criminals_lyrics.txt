WE BACK
(Verse 1) 
Look, I’m going so syck I might cause an epidemic
I’m taking so many shots, you’re gonna need a paramedic
Man tryna diss, mans laughing ‘cause bro that was pathetic
You write ‘bars’ my lyrics can go all prophetic
My kid in her stomach, the boy’ll ball, because it’s genetic
Girl, you’re my lover, you got the pussy that I’d die for
If I get close to the pussy, I’m Michael Phelps, she know I’m a diver
I keep trying to tell her I’m a lover, not a fighter
But I can’t, got the shank ready if you wanna fight her
Know a guy like Sigurddson, tried to force dick in a minor
Is my man deaf? Does my man know coach said striker not strike hеr?
He could’ve had a career, ruined by an allеgation
Ruined it like Mason but this one a writer, she ain’t a rider
At least she didn’t want to be, man tried to be the pussy grinder
But there’s something called “consent”, forced in his wood while she slept
Just because you tryna be me, you ain’t no player
You need to have a pull, you’ll get the pussy a bit later
If you try and force it on then, you’ll put bitches in danger
Look at the curves, I ain’t no stranger, I only go for the major
Don’t mess with my money or my girls, I’ll use the Glock you failure
When I’m 22 I’ll have the 2.2 and 22 M’s
Only M’s you’ll ever get is the form of a bad hairline
Don’t take my girl, even if you could, they’re mine
If I go on a holiday with a shoreline
She can’t get enough of me, I gotta continue my bloodline
22 with a 2.2, just came back from from a long vacation
But the time I’m that’s a 2.1, I got red bones and I got Asians
I got chocolates and I got cravings
I just flied the ting it’s in Turks
And that still works, cause they put the cakes in
If it weren’t me on paddles, I got saddles sat in handles
My shooters stayed in touch
It came in clutch cah I don’t do manuals
You got dough and you got hope
No, I see it from a different angle
Bad bitch with her hair on rope
Olivia Pope, it’s one big scandal
Now you know who I am, come down to the trap
Man thinks he’s tough, you’d get shakes in minutes, you can’t even rap
So stop the cap, trapboy with the J, you want the smoke?
Cap
My man talking about hoes, my man’s bars are lousy
At least try rapping about something real you townie
Your girl is mostly silicone and still flat, she tryna be pouty
Stop pretending to be me, I’m a real player, I get the bounty
But I will never forget the day I found me the cutest caramel brownie
The chest and back both bouncy, trust me, everything’s shake (Sheikh), no Saudi
Because that girl got a back like 360 degrees
I might overheat so I’ll drop bars to freeze
Pull up with the gun, load the .36, put her on her knees
Then I’ll take 10 shots in her box, if I nut, hope I don’t hit the jeans
If I get in her box, know I can finish, I’ll find the corner
Just know we’re the star players of all the winning teams
Ask a man if he sure like Luke (Luke Shaw) like her room my theatre of dreams
I had to slap her ass to make sure it wasn’t one of my wild dreams
It’s still shaking, she’s thick but I think I permanently changed that chick
She proceeds to give me head, girls always in my dick (dickhead)
But y’all jealous cause you know that’s not how you’re lit
You’re on that but not in that way, you ain’t ever seen a real tit
You talk about bitches but you’re love life is an ancient myth
I have the drip of a hurricane, on a bad day I can spit
I’m ready for a girl always, are they? I ain’t ever quit
She got her hands on the gun, let’s take a few shots, go down the pit
The girls know I ain’t ever finished but any day I can spit
She love my swag so much she anyways tryna take my clothes off
If you in the beef, I ain’t scared to knock a bastard’s nose off
I’ll paint a picture, it’s a starry night, no Vincent Van Gough
You spend a night alone, I take shots all night, I ain’t ever gonna stop

(Verse 3) 
I drag ya from the trunk
And beat you something awful
I hope you like to gag a rag
Cuz playa got a jaw-full
Like an apostle
Imma crucify you upside down
Crown of thorns round your ankles
Then proceed to drown
Ya in a bucket
Just until the bubbles stop
Then I give ya CPR cuz friend
It’s just too soon to drop
You’ll miss out on all the fun
And games that I had for y’all
Like “Operation”, where we take
Out your organs and glands, that’s all
Scream all you want
Even the ones that can hear you are frontin
Acting like they didn’t hear nothin
Cuz you rippin and runnin
Stealin their deck while the shit is still bumpin
Chillin and hearing the shit
Like there’s nobody coming
Well I’ll tell you something
That “nobody” coming is me
And I’m gunning, you see
But I ain’t gonna shoot you
That’s 💯, believe!
Instead imma paint a target on your head
And after that
Take a bat
And put it to the back
Of your skull
Then rip out your fingernails
And make your tongue null
Don’t you worry about that blood
I can cauterize those wounds
And that rotten smells because
Of all of the maggots, pus and ooze
I think I heard once on TV
That maggots can clean wounds
And since it was on TV
It must be fuckin true
Guess imma stand you up and tie a noose
Around your neck
When you can no longer stand
I guess you’ll choke to death 🤷🏻‍♂️
(Verse 4) 
Disorders attackin’ pads with a pace to form a sick-cypher
While lyrical gunners clip-snipers and steady snip-vipers
Whose creepin’ in the grass trying to slip us poison
That’s causing voices making every single last boy-sin
Til’ they’re in fiery hell reigning ready to enjoy-jinns
You see the cypher’s spittin’ the hottest dragons-breath
So addicting you’d hope-for-the-cream
To buy a preview of the high like “what happens-next?”
Now we spittin’ out scopolamine
I’m dope-to-the-scene on R-B writin’ and switching-flow
To the point even a crackhead would start pitching-blow
Mad MC’s i’m lynching-though into the burner
Diss disorder now your notepads writin’ murder
A known burglar cookin’ domes hotter than a burger
Once i robbed four brother’s and kilt bobby mercer
To keep it real we know you stay lovin’ my schemes
Til’ you’re addicted like dope druggin’ with fiends
I’m trustin’ my team and clutchin’ a beam attached
Syck cypher is unmatched with fat-raps to wack-tracks
I’m back-jack slayin’ MC’s in the arena-of-voice
Gat-claps now they ass is missin’ like marina-joyce
To the point we cypher joints and start puffing-spliffs
Yo it’s disorder n’ i’m out… you know who the fuck-it-is
(Verse 5) 
Skrrrahhh, pap, pap, ka-ka-ka (gun fire)
Aye aye, yeah, uhh-huh
/ gras boutta step up, been slotted between a couple GOATS, disorder an thoughtsminted
/ this the thirds syck cypher
/ packed with the blocks greatest
/ so gras boutta drop 50 of the shaddiest
/ gettin intimate with the beat
/ but the opposite to 50 shades, cause im killin it
/ so sit back an take a seat
/ let this ferment in your head
/ simplistic thoughts morphed into complex ryhmes, with clever messages
/ like im plannin my career with everyline i fill
/ gettin a headrush, feelin how i feel after a line
/ but if you gon cut me one, make it a slug, 8 fold a normal one
/ only sellin coke by the 8 ball, no time for bags
/ only clean bitches, no time for slags
/ but, now thats enough with the clean shit
/ im boutta body some bitches
/ writin like mitosis
/ an i’m’a put you beyond diagnosis
/ with just 1 verse, im convertin two “rappers” to gras daughters
/ makin a career, outta how i write
/ no cell division, but put me inna cell wit you
/ an you gon leave in two
/ only a minute after lights out
/ its night night for you
/ but i ain't even close to my peek form, my pinacle ain't in sight, its higher then a barnicle strapped to space x
/ cause like i said, like mitosis
/ i got 4 stages
/ only in my second tho, like the metaphase
/ but i ain’t phased, still catchin careers without a graze
/ still packin a mega verse
/ fulla hella dope ryhmes an shit
/ creatin art, n spittin pictures, spinning you out, like a bad trip in the metaverse
/ like satan in human form
/ l’m’a take you thru hell on earth
/ you ain't gon survive, success rate comparable to the seals hell week, ha
/ this ain't a game, like i ain't playin cod
/ but im on a search an destroy
/ fixin to deply a couple tips
/ an stick em in’is obliques
/ they gon push thru, an fuck your kidneys up
/ shootin point blank, like they look like the canned type
/ til they spilled all over his street
/ on the run, sayin fuck the 5-0, this homo dont deserve a hearse
/ so i’m’a burry’im, wrapped up like a hershe, hershey bar)
/ decapitated like hershal, in the walkin dead
/ i’m’a refer inscriptia to amc
/ cause they penny pinchin, an souless, perfect fit for a zombie filler
/ i’m’a get grimey, i’m’a zombie killer, call me rick grimes, cause im walkin that line
(Verse 6) 
Enjoying Artful accismus,according to another’s equanimity
/My mindset might align automatically,however
/I so instantly still instinctively Salk in silenced insanity
/Grotesque imagery gets more gloriously gruesome when I gaze at the gore oozing glamorously
/An Artificial armature aberration appears angrily
/Tantalizingly telling ten tales to the tattered troupe
Tauntingly
/rigor mortis radiates when I’m rising rapidly
/Deadly depiction demonstrating that dreams deviate deliberately
/Separate the sanctions so stories seemingly make sense simultaneously
/After all I am adamant about adhering to avoid any anachronistic attitude adjustment essentially
/Yearly yearning,your yellowtails yelp for yesterday
/Centuries dissipate,certainly deteriorate,cannibalistic decapitations circumnavigate
/Tsunami Traveling towards torrential tyranny in our territory
/guillotine harnesses gravity,grandeur hierarchy going greatly
/ curiosity reaveals why corpses get carved cleanly
/Maybe less modular medical malpractice manifesting
/drearily dreaming for the dawning of different days which are definitely delicate
/Since sixteenth century in 1543,scientific revaluation started with Copernicus on Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres
/However habilitation shows the heightening of halfheartedness harboring
/Thee titanic setting sail,sinking solemnity two thousand twenty four on board,over 1500 perished on Monday 15th April 1912 5:18 GMT
(Verse 7) 
Stare out to space maybe one day I can land
Can't always be superman
No man your savior
Now or later smarty gotta savor the present and it's flavor
Mental health is important almost drown in thoughts need a life saver
Under the moon ain't nothing safer
Mother's nurture from mother nature
One in the chamber can't dwell on a failure
Keep it pushing, work hard that's mandatory labor
A gold mine (mind) so this great depression I say see ya later
Stray from Judases and a hater
They don't feel me, I spill it all on paper
No longer cater to the world
My head full eyes in swirls
Her fingertips wrapped around my curls
Left turns into chasing the highways, in the rearview write those wrongs my name is Earl, ninety nine problems is my swan song
Draw a line in the sand
Not with pyramid schemes not with the sacrificing of Mary and her little Lamb
No bad vibes don't get me outta my element, outta my tribe
I just got feeling right
A little bit of coke and rum?
Vodka sprite?
Late nights with white gold sativa?
I'm just an ass, alright
Well, viva la viva! Bam
Sharp minded, I'm all in just like my Adidas
I don't mean to preach to ya
Maybe have a seat with ya
Something to leave with ya
Just to keep it up even when beaten up
Know times rough and the peace ain't been keeping up
Tell the reaper he ain't reaping us
Under the rug we sweeping it up
Anything that'll creep up blood erupt
Nip and tuck no fucks given
Listen babygirl told you I'm one in million
Special edition on a mission I just need the position
Make it happen practicing my magician on repetition
In addition submission with my convictions it hits different
No longer devote time to ignorance, no subscription
Compositions filled with these inscriptions
Tradition is to reposition the suspicion, none of it commission
Just ammunition to make my attitude Piston with the handwritten, good riddance
Distance in an instance no longer need your assistance
I'm the system love my symptoms in rhythms giving off visions of collisions
Indecisions there goes the cynicism
(Verse 8) 
I call myself a chopper cause I chop bitches down
No love for these hoes, now then we’re is my crown
Yea, like I run this town
Call me COVID how I’m Syck since I’ll bring down a crowd
Been natural to this shit like a prophet had it vowed
I feel confident today so my heads in a cloud
Yo, I feel like I’m the GOAT, they ask for my coat
I don’t trust anyone so I gotta say no
You can act like me kick it but really we don’t
I’m feelin lil lucky cause I could fuck your ho
But I’m not into that so I won’t give the show
My pay been postponed? Well shit I gotta work more
I don’t care about more since that’s all that I have
I need to stay rich to feel I got the power
Call me Ye how I’m the man of the hour
Empire State Building, still tear down a tower
Call you old milk how you lookin so sour
Call me old milk cause I get all that cheddar
Bitch I’m Lil Reddy, walk in in a sweater
Now give me a list of who you think is better
Leave you wig split (huh huh)
You dipshit (huh huh)
Acting like you did shit
I’m the one that handle the business
Call me Jay I’m a business man, damn
I got a thing to be at
In London, BIA
Halt sir, throw the pizza
Triple, hit via
Wait, I took the door so I could air out the house
You be acting silent and tiny, you just like mouse
See I’m a smart cookie, what happens when I don’t take their vows
Sometimes I don’t give a fuck
Moving on, I’m like Gunna or Thug (why?)
Everything litty I love when it’s hot
Pour up lean, disguise it with some Scott
Hustle for money, cause I don’t got a lot
Nah i’m just playing, it clog up like a clot
Why am I winning? It’s just us the plot
I’m making some money like I matched the slot
When your at your top you always know there someone better
But gotta put a brave face, act like your in the spotlights center
To be experimental I feel to a new genre you gotta be the inventor
Confidence is key, be on offense not the defender
I think we lost, I hate to be the sender
Treat people like they are my enemy and it go public
Now take this wait-
But there’s people better than us, that’s what we gotta remember uh
Hold up, switch the flow up
I give no fucks
I want bentley trucks
Grind until I have a buck
Save until I’m outta luck
Hardcore cult of a media
Make me say yuck
Ay
(Verse 9) 
(SOUND THE ALARMS!)
I’ll slap a luna tick so hard that bitch’ll clip out of reality/
Emerge in the “back rooms” where I’ll be waiting to pinch off them arteries/
With an arm triangle choke, ‘cause I’m sicker than the thought of me/
Sniffin’ my mother in law’s thong when I saw it sprawled along her daughter’s things/
Y’all hollow kings best recognize who leads this monarchy with anarchy/
A lone wolf, scrawled across both hands, a “bane” to woke armies like Tom Hardy/
Never simp, I’m bad enough to ghost Cardi B and Megan Thee Stallion/
After takin’ their cakes and makin’ the bakery file bankruptcy, how can/
SanDmaN keep amazingly paddin’ his legacy unchallenged by talent/
‘cause I seek netting my goals like Canadian Maple leafs, rowdy and unbalanced/
I’ll pounce on you cowards like a cougar in pursuit of a toddler/
While hollerin’ hakuna matata, remove an arcana from the arm of chupacabra/
Show up at the tournament not concerned a bit, book me a room with Katana/
You’ll hear that naughty mama moanin’ and hollerin’ at two in the mornin’/
When I’m clobberin’ and demolishin’ her organs, drop her loose like Foreman/
When Ali roped the dope, then departed ‘em
By blastin’ on ‘em, dude in orbit/
I’d rather sit in a room with 20 sexist TikTok toxic feminists/
And listen to their misandry as they openly mock us and plot against us men/
Than to water down my content so a snowflake doesn’t melt/
Actually, clump them Tinkerbells on a bus and just start dumping shells/
Until I’ve reduced them utter fails and their cell to little more than rusty nails/
Fuck Hollyweird too with their race swapping and revisionist history/
A black Cleopatra? fine…but I want a white MLK to finish out the idiocy/
I’d rather drink Bud Light and tack up posters of Dylan Mulvaney/
Than to spend another 4 years under slow Joe and the villainous fake leads/
Who don’t support vets and give criminals more rights than citizens/
Look at the streets of Chicago and the businesses leavin’ the premises/
Biden the type of dude to watch his wife and Jodie in bed/
While jerkin’ it with encouragement from Kamala moaning in his head/
Haha
I’m outEmbed
