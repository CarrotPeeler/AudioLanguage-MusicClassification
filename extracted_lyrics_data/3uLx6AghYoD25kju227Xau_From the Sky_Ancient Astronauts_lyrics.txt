1 ContributorUp in the Air Lyrics
This is what I'm supposed to do
I hear Illuminati lies, but they know the truth
With the Christians I'd sit and listen at Afterschock
But I'm religiously convinced that we're just ancient astronauts
A light rained down from the sky
A U.F.O - praise Hosanna on high
Open your eyes back to biblical times
Nimbus is a testament it's all in your mind
(Spoken)
I was at the Under the Influence tour in Detroit
When Wiz Khalifa told me to "put that shit up in the air"


My guess is to assess the best state of the mission
Mission statement: Second Coming - give a fuck if you're Christian
Alas, in this establishment, there's nary listen
Call it "antidisestablishmentarianism"

We'll never Separate - no State and Religion
Like Excision from my Cancer - Cut and lay in Remission
Then when Chaz and I created the formation of Nimbus I said
"Grand Haven's Dee-Lite-ful but I'm done with scraping the dishes"
You might also like
I used to scrape change - thoughts of scraping the sky
These bars will pave the way, call it "taking a Dive"
I won't change my mind about changing my life
So I gave Austin that Nightcall - now we're making the Drive

And now we're saying goodbye to all our people in Michigan
Had to take off the Mitten to get to splitting the dividends
Play your cards right - we've got the luck of the pair
Sunset at ArcLight - Nimbus - Up in the AirEmbed
