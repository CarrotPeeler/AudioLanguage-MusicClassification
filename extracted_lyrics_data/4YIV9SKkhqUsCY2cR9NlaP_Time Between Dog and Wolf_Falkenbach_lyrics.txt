2 ContributorsTime Between Dog And Wolf LyricsFlocks of birds for sake the barren lands
I'm following suit with idle heart and empty hands
However strong a rock, time and tide will grind it down
To sand and the ground wears its burial gown
With gloom-ridden eyes and shrouded in grief
I shoulder my past to find my final relief
Each winter ploughed deeper furrows in my face
The next one is sure to leave its terminal trace
... terminal trace
Whomever i owe my life to, it's time now to pay back
Yet all i have to offer is this battered human wreck
I gave more than i had but i'm still willing to give more
I swear this oath to me and i swear it with a roar
Salvation awaits but simple i mind
As for me i can fight, i leave nothing behind
Trapped in the time between dog and wolf
I am trapped in the time between dog and wolf
