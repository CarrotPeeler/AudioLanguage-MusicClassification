*Screaming*
Ladies, ladies, if you ain't no bitch, don't like to be called bitch
Put your hands up like this heeere
Yo, on the count of three, here's what I want y'all to say for me
Don't call me biiitch, punk
One, two, three
Don't call me biiitch, punk (Uh-oh)
Ahh the ladies are in the house (Uh-oh)

I know they do, so check this out
Fellas, at the count of one two three
Let me hear you repeat after me
Don't call me puuunk, bitch
One, two, three
