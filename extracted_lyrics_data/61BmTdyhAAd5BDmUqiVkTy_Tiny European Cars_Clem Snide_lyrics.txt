2 ContributorsTiny European Cars LyricsTiny European cars
Are dropping from the sky
They're wonderfully efficient
Engines fueled by Spanish wine
Maybe just a sip
To help us get a grip
Did you know Isaac Newton
Was a virgin when he died
A hundred thousand naked woman
Running on the beach
In such a state of wild abandon
They ignore my speech
About the evert flow
A dangerous undertow
And how there is a hole so deep
It swallows up the sun
Oh, the smoke seems sweet to me
Must be a perfume factory
Just one of many ancient travesties
We're all descendants of the pharisees
Tiny European cars
Are bouncing off my shins
If you've never seen a bull fight
Guess who always wins
You might also likeTo grab it by the horns
Its life like censored porn
Did you know they sing
Ring-Around the Rosie when you dieEmbed
