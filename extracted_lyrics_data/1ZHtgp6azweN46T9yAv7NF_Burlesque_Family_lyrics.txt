5 ContributorsBurlesque Lyrics
Rolling and tumbling ain't done me no harm
Been boogie dat-dit-dit-dit-dit-do
Rita and Greta been twisting my arm into
Heading out west
Down to the Burlesque
But I'm saving my ace through to you

Well, drinking and sinking, I'm feeling alright
Right down to my snakey spat shoes
Just about shutdown and three in the night
Because I'm heading out west
Down to the Burlesque
Show 'em a moon at the door

Rolling, tumbling
Sure ain't done me no harm
Drinking, sinking
Has just been too bad on my arm

Well I finally lost Rita and Greta went home
I guess that leaves me and you
I've been kinda sneaky to get you alone
Oh, but you in that dress
Destination Burlesque
I got all my cards in one shoe
You might also like
Rolling, tumbling
Sure ain't done me no harm
Well, I said, drinking, sinking
Just been too bad on my arm

I finally lost Rita and Greta went home
I guess that just leaves me and you
Whoa, I've been kinda sneaky to get you alone
Oh babe, but you in that dress
Destination Burlesque
Said I got all my cards in one shoe

I got all my cards in one shoe
I got all my cards in one shoeEmbed
