3 ContributorsKeep on Believing Lyrics
Tell me what I need to know
And show me what you got to show
I go with the flow, keep on believing
It's good enough for rock and roll
If you feel it in your heart and soul
Then you’re in control, keep on believing

Are you smiling, are you frowning? Waving or drowning?
There’s too much going just to ignore
What’s the use complaining that it’s forever raining?
After all, that’s what they make umbrellas for

No matter what we say
You’re gonna do it anyway
Better start today, keep on believing
In the middle of the night
It’s dark, but don’t lose sight
There's no wrong or right, keep on believing

And when your only trouble is the bursting of the bubble
Remember that there’s nothing left to fear
Don’t let your consternation spoil your celebration
Just ask yourself "What’s the big idea?"
You might also like

Are you smiling, are you frowning? Waving or drowning?
There’s too much going just to ignore
What’s the use complaining that it’s forever raining?
After all, that’s what they make umbrellas for

Now, I don’t wanna make it worse
Time's forward, no reverse
From the cradle to the hearse, keep on believing
Don’t want for it to end
I need someone to call a friend
On whom I can depend, keep on believing
I don’t want to spoil your day
But I’m gonna say it anyway
There’s a price to pay, keep on believingEmbed
