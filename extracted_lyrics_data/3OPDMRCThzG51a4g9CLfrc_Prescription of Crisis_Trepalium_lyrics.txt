1 ContributorPrescription Of Crisis LyricsEasy to be crazy
Fucked up, insane
To be different, only
Get out your brain....
Life with answers
Mind cancer, wanna know
Anxiety, paranoia, megalomania
Guilty, obssesed!
Decompensation!
Posology, remedy
Give me straitjacket!
Bad or nice
To day what's my facet!
Sweet, and so false
What can you know
Try to understand
Contain and be undermainned
Then, now we can speak a little
Or just see a freak, attached well
Wipe the spittle and all can be told
Give pills again, you offer me loneliness
Eyes disgusted towards the paradise
With the sweet sound of cries...
Along lane where I can only get lost
I had to be cured but I just fed my madness
I will tell you what you wanna hear
And never see which I am not any more there
Let me free, I m already
Ouside, I m already!
