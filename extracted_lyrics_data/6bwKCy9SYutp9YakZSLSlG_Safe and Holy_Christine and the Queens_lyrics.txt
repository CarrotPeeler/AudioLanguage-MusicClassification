9 ContributorsSafe and Holy Lyrics
Motus takes out all the drags for dancing
With the rain, I look disgusting
I'm feeling nauseous as they hold my hand
I've been crouching since the morning

But what I have left, baby
What gives me hope, maybe
Are heavy collapses when I'm dancing

Now I've got to have some patience
With the rhythm, then you get strong
Feverous, full undisclosed beliefs
Your arms wide open, can't be wrong

Cause what I have left, baby
What gives me hope lately
Are weathering fires when I'm dancing

And as I shake my crumbled bones
I'm safe and holy, safe and holy
I lend my name not to be lame, to swim
Away from me and from my eyes
That mock and judge me, mock and judge me
That always drown
Kids of my own, my desires
My desires
You might also like
As I dance, I am safe and holy
As I dance, I am safe and holy

And as I shake my crumbled bones
I'm safe and holy, safe and holy
I lend my name not to be lame, to swim
Away from me and from my eyes
That mock and judge me, mock and judge me
That always drown
Kids of my own, my desires

I messed the story up again
Safe and holy, safe and holy
For it to stop feeling the same
I made the story up again
Safe and holy, safe and holy
For you to love me still the same
I messed the story up again
Safe and holy, safe and holy
For it to stop feeling the same
I made the story up again
Safe and holy, safe and holy
For you to love me still the sameEmbed
