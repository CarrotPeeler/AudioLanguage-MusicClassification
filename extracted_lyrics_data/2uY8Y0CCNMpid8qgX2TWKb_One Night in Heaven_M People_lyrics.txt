5 ContributorsOne Night in Heaven LyricsIntro:
One night in heaven. One night in heaven
One night in heaven. One night in heaven. (One Night)
One night in heaven. One night in heaven
One night in heaven. One night in heaven. (Yeaah)
Sometimes I get to thinking. While you are far away
Just how much I miss you and how time it ticks away
So sad when we are fighting, too much tension too much hate
Sometimes I need reminding, before it gets too late
Just one moment in my day. Take me up to a place
So far away in your heavenly space
Chorus-Heather Small:
One night (one night),hmm one night in heaven. When you touch me
You take me up high with the clouds in the sky
One night (one night),ooh one night in heaven. When you kiss me
You light up my life, make me feel so alive
While people create problems, lie cheat in vain
Come lay with me in my bed and wash away the pain
Take me on a journey let the pleasure start
Take me on a journey that leads straight to your heart
Just one look I can see in your face, yeah
You're my love satellite in orbit with you. Such a beautiful place
