8 ContributorsBy My Side Lyrics
You've been there since Queen St. in 1993
Twenty years and a thousand beers and you're still there for me
Whitaker Park park after dark, 'till the cops came spotlighting
And yeah we ran, we were just kids back then
And we're still singin'...
(Yeah!)

I don't wanna die
I don't wanna die
I don't wanna die-ie-ie
But if I do die, do die
I know you'll be by my side

Outcasts in a small town, in Big Sky country
You had a pickup truck with the music turned up
"Let's Go!" cassete side B
How we risked our lives playing with knives to escape monotony
After all the stupid things we did our hearts are still beating

I don't wanna die
I don't wanna die
I don't wanna die-ie-ie
But if I do die, do die
I know you'll be by my side
I don't wanna die
I don't wanna die
I don't wanna die-ie-ie
But if I do die, do die
I know you'll be by my side
You might also like
(Hell yeah)
(We got two of that, baby)
(Right here in L.A.)

I don't wanna die
I don't wanna die
I don't wanna die-ie-ie
But if I do die, do die
I know you'll be by my side
Oy oy!
I don't wanna die
I don't wanna die
I don't wanna die-ie-ie
But if I do die, do die
I know you'll be by my side

I know you'll be by my side
I know you'll be by my side
I know you'll be by my side1Embed
