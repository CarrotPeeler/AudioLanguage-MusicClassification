1 ContributorCity of Stone LyricsEntrapment crushes me, pressured soul
Devoured by my own passion's maw
In this cold infinite I am torn
Surrounded by option, the city of stone
Now the abyss calls my name
Within this chaotic void, I wither alone
Just like a dog with three legs, I struggle to stay above
I hear the voices of failure
I feel the pressure upon me
Pressing down into me, pressing down
Pressing down into me, I feel the weight
(Entrapment) Pressing down (pressured soul) into me
(By my own) Pressing down (passion's maw)
Pressing down into me, I am rеstrained
To stand up, to push against the stone
Wondеr aimless, forlorn being, constant migrant seeking purpose
Pushing against this monument, I am forever strugglingYou might also likeEmbed
