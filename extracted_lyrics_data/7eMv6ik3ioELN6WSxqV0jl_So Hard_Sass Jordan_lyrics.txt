1 ContributorSo Hard LyricsWell I spend the nights holding back holding tight
But it's so hard in your eyes
I'm seein' that you don't notice me
And it's so hard
Well you star when I'm dreamin' in the middle of the night
Tossin' and turning but you never get the message I'm sending out
Cos if I told you I need you would you think it was right
There's something in my heart that is tellin' me to keep away from him
Love is not too logical
Hearts are not infallible you know
Mine is working overtime
To save me from your eyes save me
I try to tell you goodbye but it's so hard
I try to live in a lie but it's so hard
Everyone's saying that I'm wastin' all my time
Starin' out the window while I'm tryin' to find the lines
I'm searching for
You can tell me that I'm dreamin' you can tell me I'm blind
But something here is driving me to find a way to break my heart in two
It's breakin' up
Love is not too logical
Hearts are not infallible you know
Mind is working overtime
Save me from your eyes save me

I try to live in a lie but it's so hard
I try to tell you goodbye but it's so hard
I try to live in a lie but it's so hardEmbed
