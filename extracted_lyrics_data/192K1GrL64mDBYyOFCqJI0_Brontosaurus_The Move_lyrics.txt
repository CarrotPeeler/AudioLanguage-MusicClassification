Well, her sister used to hate it
So I never thought she'd make it
But she threw you all
Supposing in a spangle wrapper
She will let you stroke her head
But if you move away, you're dead
She'll just break you up
Before you realize it's happened

But she can really do the Brontosaurus
And she can scream the heebie-jeebies for us
Until you know what she's really got
'Cause she can do it loud
And she can really do the Brontosaurus
And she can scream the heebie-jeebies for us
But I know she can really rock
She'll do it, do it now
Do it, do it, do it

Well, her daddy's getting old
And he seemed to lose control
When the Brontosaurus
Stormed into the house to trap her
Well, her sister used to hate it
So I never thought she'd make it
Until she shook you up
Exactly like a firecracker
You might also like
But she can really do the Brontosaurus
And she can scream the heebie-jeebies for us
Until you know what she's really got
'Cause she can do it loud
And she can really do the Brontosaurus
And she can scream the heebie-jeebies for us
But I know she can really rock
She'll do it, do it now
Do it, do it, do it

Well, she can really do the Brontosaurus
And she can scream the heebie-jeebies for us
Until you know what she's really got
So she can do it

Well, she can really do the Brontosaurus
And she can scream the heebie-jeebies for us
Until you know what she's really got
'Cause she can do it

Well, she can really do the Brontosaurus
And she can really do the Brontosaurus
And she can really do the Brontosaurus, yeah
