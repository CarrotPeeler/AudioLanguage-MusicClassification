Silver And Gold
I'll be home for Christmas
You can plan on me
Please have snow and mistletoe
And presents on the tree
Christmas eve will find me
Where the love light gleams
I'll be home for Christmas
If only in my dreams
You can plan on me
I'll be home for Christmas
If only in my dreams
Oh! the weather outside is frightful
But the fire is so delightful
And since we've no place to go
Let it snow! Let it snow! Let it snow!
You might also likeIt doesn't show signs of stopping
So I brought some corn for popping;
The lights are turned 'way down low
Let it snow! Let it snow! Let it snow! When we finally kiss good-night
How I hate going out in the storm!
But if you really hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm
The fire is slowly dying
And, my dear, we're still good-bye-ing
But as long as you love me so
Let it snow! Let it snow! Let it snow!
Silver and gold
Silver and gold
Ev'ryone wishes for silver and gold
How do you measure its worth?
Just by the pleasure it gives here on earth
Silver and gold
Silver and gold
Mean so much more when I see
