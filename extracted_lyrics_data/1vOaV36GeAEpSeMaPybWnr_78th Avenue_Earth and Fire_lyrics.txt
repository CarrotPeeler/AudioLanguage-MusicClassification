1 Contributor78th Avenue LyricsLife started with you, seven-eight avenue
The sun was just comin’ through
And brightened the morning dew
When will you ever return again?
Don’t let me down
‘Cause I’m sure, the summer
Will make us feel like new
It’s the only change that we can get together
Just me and you
On seven-eight avenue
On seven-eight avenue
On seven-eight avenue
Love took us away every summer night
The chasing crazy world of today
Was getting out of sight
When will you ever return again?You might also likeEmbed
