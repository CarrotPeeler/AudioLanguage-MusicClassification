Login confirmed
All my people
Right here, right now
It's lit
No one stops me
My machine knows what's mine
I'm shifting shapes and shaping time
Argh
All my people
Right here, right now
Spinnin' to the sound
Spinnin' outta control
Counter-attack
Spin it back
My machine, my machine
It's my machine, my machine
Take, take, take
Take my body
Is separate from my mind
Counter-attack
Spin it back

Feelin' like
Cybernet overload
Feelin' like
Feelin' like
My machine, my machine
It's my machine, my machine
All my people
Right here, right nowEmbed
