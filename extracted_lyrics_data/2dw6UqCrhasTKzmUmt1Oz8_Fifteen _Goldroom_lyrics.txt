5 ContributorsFifteen Lyrics
It's been a long time, wondering why
The summer smells like sin and wonder
Feels like it
Got inside of
A place and time
I dream about when
I get a walk in
I'll let us always
The summer sun I can't go back to
The touch of your skin
On my skin
Look away the sun's above us
Now you know we'll look back up in time

But we were only fifteen
Fifteen we're floating through the slipstream
You're with me, we were only fifteen
Fifteen just floating through the slipstream

It's been a long time
Wondering why
The summer smells like sin and wonder
Feels like it
Got inside of
A place and time
I dream about when
I get a walk in
I'll let us always
The summer sun I can't go back to
The touch of your skin
On my skin
Look away the sun's above us
Now you know we'll look back up in time
You might also like
But we were only fifteen
Fifteen we're floating through the slipstream
You're with me, we were only fifteen
Fifteen just floating through the slipstream
We were only fifteen
Fifteen we're floating through the slipstream
You're with me, we were only fifteen
Fifteen just floating through the slipstream
We were only fifteen
Fifteen we're floating through the slipstream1Embed
