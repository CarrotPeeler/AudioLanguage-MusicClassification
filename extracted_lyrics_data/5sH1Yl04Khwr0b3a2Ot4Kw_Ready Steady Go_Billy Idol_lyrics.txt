1 ContributorReady Steady Go LyricsReady, steady, go
I'm not in love with television
I'm not in love with the radio
I'm not in love with the Kings Road
"Because I'm in love with Cathy McGowan", she said
"Ready, steady, go and all things", she said
Like ready, steady, go, I want it fabulous
I say, "Ready, steady, go"
"I'm not in love with Juke Box Jury
I'm not in love with thank you jucky stars
I'm not in love with Twiggy
Because I'm in love with Cathy McGowan", she said
"Ready, steady, go and all things", she said
Like ready, steady, go, I want it fabulous
I say, "Ready, steady, go"
I'm still in love with the Beatles
I was in love with the Stones, no satisfaction
I was in love with Bobby Dylan
Because I'm in love with rock 'n' roll
"Ready, steady, go and all things", she said
Like ready, steady, go, I want it fabulous
I say, "Ready, steady, go
Ready, steady, go
Go, go, go
Ready, steady, go
Ready, steady, who?
Ready, steady, stone
Go, go, go, goYou might also likeEmbed
