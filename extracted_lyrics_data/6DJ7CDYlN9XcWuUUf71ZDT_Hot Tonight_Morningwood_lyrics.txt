2 ContributorsHot Tonight LyricsWhat's your name? (what's your name)
Where's your mommy?
'Cause you look like a baby to me
What'd you do for a good time?
Would you do anything I please?
And you told yourself to look the other way
What's a lonely boy to do
You're so hot tonight
I'm giving it
I'm giving it
Your toes crossed the line
Wanna go (wanna go)
But to my place
Maybe do a shot of moustique
Keep it low (shhhh)
'Cause my roomate
She listens up to every squick
So get closer now and let me show you how
Show you how to be discrete
You can crawl on my staircase
And we can you're dirty up the sheets
And you told yourself to look the other way
What's a lonely boy to do

I'm giving it
I'm giving it
You're so hot tonight
I'm giving it
I'm giving it
Your toes crossed the line (Come on)
Oh... I see you lickin' me over
I must be getting my way
I must be getting my way
You're so hot tonight
I'm giving it
I'm giving it
You're so hot tonight
I'm giving it
I'm giving it
Your toes crossed the line
I'm giving it
I'm giving it
You're so hot tonight
I'm giving it
I'm giving it
Your toes crossed the line
I'm giving it
I'm giving itEmbed
