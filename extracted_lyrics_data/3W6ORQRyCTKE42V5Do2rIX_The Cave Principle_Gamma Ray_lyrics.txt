1 ContributorThe Cave Principle Lyrics
I crawl across the floor, never see the light
Only shadows on the wall
Somebody said there is reality behind
But I'm afraid to turn and fall—oh, no

Set me free—for eternity

And now they talk about my destiny again
I hear their footsteps in the dark
But then again, there was the silence and the pain
Ooh, Lord, that made me feel so lost

Help me—get out of here
Save me—my world's an illusion


I'm still inside the cave, imprisoned in my mind
And silhouettes on the wall
I have to turn around to see what's goin' on
'Cause what I saw was never all
You might also like
Just a move is the solution
It's not enough to stand and stare
Leave the cave and find a reason
For the cross you have to bear

Never, never, never
Never return to the principle
Never, never
Never return to the principle
Never, never
Never return to the principle
Oh, never, we will never
We will never return to the principle
Oh, never, we will never
We will never return to the principle
Oh, never, we will never
We will never return to the principle
Oh, never, we will never
We will never return to the principleEmbed
