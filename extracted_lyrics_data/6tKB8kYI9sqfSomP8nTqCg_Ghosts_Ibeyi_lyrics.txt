9 ContributorsGhosts Lyrics
He he he he he
Welcome to my earth
It's a crying shame
We have built a foolish world
Busy fighting, cruelly lying and denying

My ghosts are not gone
They dance in the shade
And kiss the black core of my heart
Making words, making sounds, making songs

Now you can feel my heart spinning
You turn my whole life around
I want to write a new beginning
Let go of the ghosts
Let dreams and hopes fly
And give our love another try
Should we just let it be?

Make love to me
My ghosts are not gone
They kiss the black core of my heart
Making words making sounds making songs
You might also like
Now you can feel my heart spinning
You turn my whole life around
I want to write a new beginning
Let go of the ghosts
Let dreams and hopes fly
And give our love another try
Should we just let it be?

We ain't nothing without love, without love
We ain't nothing without love, without love
