I ain't fit to be no mother
I ain't fit to be no wife, yeah
I been workin' like a man, y'all
I been workin' all my life, yeah
All my life, y'all
All my life, yeah

There ain't no dinner on the table
Ain't no food in the 'fridgerator
I go to work and I'll be back later
I go to work, said I'd be back later
'Cause I've been workin' like a man, y'all
I've been workin' all my life, yeah
All my life, y'all
All my life, yeah


Lord, you know I'm a good looking woman
Lord, you know I'm a good looking girl and-a
If you want to give me something
Anything in this great big world, then
Lord, you know that I am ready
For my sugar, my sugar daddy
Lord, you know that I am ready
For my sugar, my sugar daddyYou might also likeEmbed
