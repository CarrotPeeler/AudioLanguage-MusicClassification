2 ContributorsThe Love We Have Lyrics

Once you took me up to the stars
You filled me with your "Ooh's" and your "Aahh's"
You did a number on my brain
Now you're pulling me down and down
I'd say you're trying to put me under the ground
You're like a wind-blown weather vane

I know that the love that we have
Is as close as the sea and the sand
It's far from good, it's far from bad

You've got me on my "P's" and my "Q's"
Checking every little word that I use
My heart is slipping to my toes
Then you give me sugar and cream
And you soothe me like a beautiful dream
You're like a faucet, hot and cold

I know that the love that we have
Is as close as the sea and the sand
It's far from good, it's far from bad
You might also like
No, I'm not complaining, just contemplating
Don't get me wrong, now, poor vision
I think that the season is perfect for teasin'
But what is your reason for indecision? (Indecision)
Indecision (Indecision)

Maybe things'll turn out okay
Lately
You treat me in a loveable way
I hope the weather doesn't change
Suddenly your love disappears
And you trade in your laughter for tears
You're like a picnic in the rain

I know that the love that we have
Is as close as the sea and the sand
It's far from good, it's far from bad
I know that the love that we have
Is as close as the sea and the sand
It's far from good, it's far from badEmbed
