3 ContributorsHeart Attack LyricsCome on, like anybody cares your mother died
Let me tell the world to stop and have a universal cry
(Come and step right over my dead body)
Come on, like I could give a fuck you went to school
Tell me, sugar, what did you learn when you were there now?
(Come and step right over my dead body)
Karma karma karma
For the Stone in your Heart
Well you thought you were cool but you’re not--
Karma karma karma
And you’re meaningless now!
Shake hands with a Leper
Mimic a manic
Fuck like an Angel
Crack like a deviled egg
If you thought I had a heart, come a Knock Knock Knock on my chest
Come on, like anybody cares you got cancer
Why should anybody in this life care about you?
Or in this room?You might also likeEmbed
