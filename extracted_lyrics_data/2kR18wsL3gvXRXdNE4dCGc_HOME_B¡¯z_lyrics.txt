4 ContributorsBuild a Home Lyrics (Zach Boucher)
It's getting late
But just a few more minutes
It’s not like I had much to say
But I'm just glad you listen
And I can tell you weren't fake to me
No, you were different
It’s sad you had to pack your stuff and leave
I wish you didn't
Don't show enough appreciation
For the ones I should
I wanna tell them how I feel
But I just wish I could
Getting so lost inside of thought
Am I misunderstood?
It's not too often
That I blossom with a lot of good
Although I would
But can't find words to address it
Look, It's a curse and a blessing
I see the walls and they're closing in
It feels worse to confess it
And with my family and friends
I don't need to work for acceptance
We need to cherish these moments
And search for building connections
Instead we’ll hide in the shade
Worried of what they might say
And lock ourselves in our minds
Just like we do every day
Look I’ve been reaching a limit
And think I've due for a change
But even then I think that I’m gonna stay
I'll be okay

I know there's quarks I've got to fix
I know there’s cracks in all my bricks
I know these things I've got to build up in myself
Before I
Before I build a home
 (Zach Boucher)
It took some time
But we made it this far
I want to look into the skies with you
And count the stars
We got too much up on our minds
We don't know where to start
The truth is
I've never been used to opening my heart
I find it hard
I hide the parts of me I'm scared to show
That's why I've got this side beneath
That most don't even know
I try to say that I'll be fine
Can do it on my own
But I need them more than they think
I wouldn't have a home
If they left me alone
So I choke
When I say I need you
Don't want to make this mistake
There isn't such thing as redos
We gotta fix what we break
It's difficult just conversing
I never know what to say
And the sun is finally setting
The end of another day
Wait, can we just take another second to embrace this?
Maybe leave and find a place
They don't believe in hatred
Where people speak their minds
And never cover it with fakeness
But if you're here with me
Is where I'm the safest
 (SailorUrLove):
I know there's quarks I've got to fix
I know there's cracks in all my bricks
I know these things I've got to build up in myself
Before I
Before I build a home
 (Zach Boucher)
I need to find a road
Pick a lane
Build a home
Make a change
Show the world that I was different
What's the point I'm trying to make?
Thoughts have got me too afraid
Enough to even show my face
The difference between you and me
Is I don't know if I'm okay
I say that we're equal
That's why I try to help people
But do I do it for them
Or just so I boost my own ego?
I know I've got good intentions
But got a few that are evil
I live in a hell in my mind
When I'm always surrounded by peaceful
Got some problems in me
I'm sure that many can see
But all them leave when I'm sitting here
Me, the moon and the breeze
And just appreciate the little things
They've given to me
It's not make-believe
It's just the key
To not want more than you need
Yeah, I'll just keep to my motives
And won't forget it
Never get slowed down
When I think of what I've regretted
You only get one life
And we're never given a second
This might be the closest I've been to heaven
 (SailorUrLove):
I know there's quarks I've got to fix
I know there's cracks in all my bricks
I know these things I've got to build up in myself
Before I
Before I build a home1Embed
