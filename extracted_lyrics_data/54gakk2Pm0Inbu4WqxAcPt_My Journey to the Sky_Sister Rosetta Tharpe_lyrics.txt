1 ContributorMy Journey to the Sky Lyrics
There's only one thing that I long for
When I reach that heavenly land
To see my Jesus and His Glory
As I go from land to land

Yes, there's only one thing that I long for
When I reach that heavenly land
And I know, I know I'll see Him
In that sweet, oh My Lord, peaceful rest

Yes, without a mother (without a mother)
Oh, without a father (without a father)
We got to make this journey by myself
Oh, heartbreak and pain (heartbreak and pain)
All left in shame
But I'll journey here alone

There's only one thing that I long for
When I reach that heavenly land
And I know, I know I'll see Him
In that sweet, oh My Lord, peaceful rest
You might also like
Yes, without a mother (without a mother)
Ooh-ooh, without a father (without a father)
We got to make this journey by myself
Oh, heartbreak and pain (heartbreak and pain)
All left in shame
But I'll journey here alone

There's only one thing that I long for
When I reach that heavenly land
And I know, I know I'll see Him
In that sweet, (Lord, yes), peaceful restEmbed
