Drop it

Report to the dance floor
The bad girls and manwhores (hey)
There’s a feeling in the club
"Love," and it’s going airborne (woo)
Phil Collins, mmm
My whole life I been waiting, mmm
For this moment I can’t waste it (scream)
Oh Lord

I'm lovesick, stricken by your
Love, it’s, really hard to
Function, like a rush of adrenaline
Beauty, intelligence, overflowing with melanin
I'm lovesick, stricken by your
Love, it’s, really hard to
Function, no quick way to phrase it
When I explain it, I say I’m

Caught in the jungle, feeling the fever
Black on white like, Dalmatian features
Black on white like, stripe on a zebra
I’m just trying to keep up
Black and white like old day programming
Black and white like Soul Train slow dancing
Black and white like MJ in the 90’s
Mulatto, light-skinned, mixbreed, hybrid
Oouu, mommy you just too damn fine for my good
If you wanna leave right now then I would
Make me wanna go all night if I could
And I could, oww
Oouu, mommy you just too damn fine for my good
If you wanna leave right now then I would
Make me wanna go all night if I could
And I could, oww
You might also like
Oouu, hey, watch out now
That sun-kissed skin make it hot out now
All class, ain't never been a drop out now
Slim thick, them lips want to pop out now, like
Oouu, hey, you go girl
That Shea butter popping like Crisco, girl
That TRESemmé making them big ol curls
And you working them pumps like Citgo, girl

I'm lovesick, stricken by your
Love, it’s, really hard to
Function, like a rush of adrenaline
Beauty, intelligence, overflowing with melanin
I'm lovesick, stricken by your
Love, it’s, really hard to
Function, no quick way to phrase it
When I explain it, "tell me baby"

Oouu, mommy you just too damn fine
Elegance on ten, you a true damn dime
Bad gyal that poom poom too damn fire
That oochie wally wally oouu la la
Yeah, white boy caught under black girl magic
Credit outstanding, so even if he looking like
B-Rad, but he be rapping like B-Rabbit
She gon' be throwing it back for the keys to a G WagonEmbed
