4 ContributorsBroken Arrow Lyrics

How many times do you lose
What you find?
Does your shadow keep
Bringing you down?

Running to grasp little memories of the past
There's a part of me that still believes
That nothing's gone for good

Everywhere you go I follow
You treat me like a broken arrow
I don't need this anymore
But I follow, I follow

Torn from the page like a knife
Cuts the rain
Every instinct screams "where are you now?"

Strangle the truth out of  everything you do
There's a love for valediction
When you're stranded on the shore
You might also like x2
Everywhere you go I follow
You treat me like a broken arrow
I don't need this anymore
But I'll follow, I'll follow

Our lives are intertwined
You learn to live you learn to die
Everything beneath the sun
That's burned along the way
(I'll start today)
Our lives are intertwined
(I'll start today)
You learn to live, you learn to die
(I'll start today)
Everything beneath the sun
(I'll start today)
That's burned along the way
 x2
Everywhere you go I follow
You treat me like a broken arrow
I don't need this anymore
But I follow, I followEmbed
