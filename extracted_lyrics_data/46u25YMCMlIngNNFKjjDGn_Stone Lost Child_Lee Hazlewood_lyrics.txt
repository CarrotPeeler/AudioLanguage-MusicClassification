She's a stone lost child
Lord, you know she doesn't know what's right
She's a stone lost child
Sleeping in some new bed tonight

Running from shadows she thinks of me
Pretending things that she will never be
So god, if you have ever done anything right
Watch over that stone lost child for me tonight

She's a stone lost child
Running naked when her clothes are new
She's a stone lost child
Giving all she has to quite a few

Living on dreams of others, slightly used
Loving their sons and brothers just to confuse
So god, if you have ever done anything right
Watch over that stone lost child for me tonight

She's a stone lost child
Free to try it in the ice and snow
She's a stone lost child
Free to love me like she did before
You might also like
So give her baby kisses when she cries
And wisdom to forgive all my lies
And god, if you have ever done anything right
Watch over that stone lost child for me tonightEmbed
