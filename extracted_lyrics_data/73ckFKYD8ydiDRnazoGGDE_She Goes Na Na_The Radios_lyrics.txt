1 ContributorShe Goes Nana Lyrics
She's like a rainbow
Sways while she glows
Moves like a river
Turns while she flows
Uuh yeah!

And then she steals
Your heart away
She's taking it all someday I'll make her mine yeah
You look into
Her angel eyes
The cherry red sun will rise and love will shine

When she goes nana nana
Nana nana
Colors will keep on turning
Shimmering by like a rainbutterfly
Cruising the blue blue sky

Oh!
She shines like a flower
Mmmmm, fades while she grows
Uuh yeah!
You might also like
And then she wipes
Your tears away
Holding your hand someday like lovers do, uuhhh
You hesitate
Another while
She's showing her magic smile and dreams come true

When she goes nana nana
Nana nana
Colors will keep on turning
Shimmering by like a rainbutterfly
Cruising the blue blue sky

She's on the run
Flies on and on
She's cruising the sky my friend
And in the end she goes
She goes nanana

Nana nana
Nana nana
Colors will keep on turning
Shimmering by like a rainbutterfly
Cruising the blue blue sky
When she goes nana nana
Nana nana
Colors will keep on turning
Shimmering by like a rainbutterfly
Cruising the blue blue skyEmbed
