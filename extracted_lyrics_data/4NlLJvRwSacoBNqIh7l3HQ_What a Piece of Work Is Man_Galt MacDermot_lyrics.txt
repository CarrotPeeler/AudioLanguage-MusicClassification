What a piece of work is man
How noble in reason
How infinite in faculties
In form and moving, how express and admirable
In action, how like an angel
In apprehension, how like a god
The beauty of the world
The paragon of animals

I have of late
But wherefore I know not
Lost all my mirth

This goodly frame
The earth
Seems to me a sterile promontory

This most excellent canopy
The air
Look you
This brave o'erhanging firmament
This majestical roof fretted with golden fire
Why it appears no othеr thing to me
Than a foul and pestilent congrеgation of vapors
What a piece of work is man
How noble in reasonYou might also likeEmbed
