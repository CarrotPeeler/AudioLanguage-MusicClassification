Five, six
Five, six, seven, eight

It's the beats
Working up the streets
Jumping, jacking
Front to the back
We always hit the ground, it's a-okay
And if we punk around, we're here to stay

Banging on the door 'cause we can't hear a thing
Keep shutting down the power 'cause we can always sing
Banging on the door 'cause we can't hear a thing
Keep shutting down the power 'cause we can always sing

We got the power back here, breaking these rules
We got the power, clap your hands for our folks
I got it here, where?
I got it there, where?
I got it
You got it
We got it everywhere (Off the pigs)

Banging on the door 'cause we can't hear a thing
Keep shutting down the power 'cause we can always sing
Banging on the door 'cause we can't hear a thing
Keep shutting down the power 'cause we can always sing
Banging on the door 'cause we can't hear a thing
Keep shutting down the power 'cause we can always sing
Banging on the door 'cause we can't hear a thing
Keep shutting down the power 'cause we can always sing

Revolution has come
Off the pigs
Time to pick up a gun
Off the pigs
Revolution has come
Off the pigs
Time to pick up a gun
Off the pigs

Banging on the door 'cause we can't hear a thing
Keep shutting down the power 'cause we can always sing
Banging on the door 'cause we can't hear a thing
Keep shutting down the power 'cause we can always sing
Banging on the door 'cause we can't hear a thing
Keep shutting down the power 'cause we can always sing
Banging on the door 'cause we can't hear a thing
Keep shutting down the power 'cause we can always sing
Revolution has come
Off the pigs
Time to pick up a gun
Off the pigs
Revolution has come
Off the pigs
Time to pick up a gun
Off the pigs
Revolution has come
Off the pigs
Time to pick up a gun
Off the pigs
Revolution has come
Off the pigs
Time to pick up a gun
Off the pigs1Embed
