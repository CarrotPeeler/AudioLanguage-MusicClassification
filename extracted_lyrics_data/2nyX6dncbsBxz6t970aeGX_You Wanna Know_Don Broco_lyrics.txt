13 ContributorsYou Wanna Know LyricsCalled me up one day
Said you didn't mind
Just called to find out
What you thought already
What you hope I'd say?
That you were my one true love, a lie
But did it keep you happy?
So I told the truth, Look at where it got me
Girl did you have to mention
Girl whatchu say
(Whatchu say, whatchu say?)
Why you gonna be like that?
Why you gonna be like that?
Is she not gonna take me back?
(Whatchu say, whatchu say?)
Why you gonna be like that?
Why you gonna be like that?
Is she not gonna take me
(Said you wanna know, oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh)
But I know you don't
But I know you don't
You liked getting laid
And it's not like you laid all of your cards out
Face up on the table
You might also likeNever broke the rules
Never crossed no boundaries
Girl did you have to mention
Girl tell me what do do
(Whatchu say, whatchu say?)
Why you gonna be like that?
Why you gonna be like that?
Is she not gonna take me back?
(Whatchu say, whatchu say?)
Why you gonna be like that?
Why you gonna be like that?
Is she not gonna take me
(Said you wanna know, oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh)
But I know you don't
But I know you don't
You said you want to know, you said you want to know
But I know you don't, but I know you don't
You said you wanted names, you said you want to date
But I know you don't, but I know you don't
You said you have your cake, you said you eat your cake
But you know I won't
(Said you wanna know, oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh)
Why you gonna be like that?
Why you gonna be like that?
(Whatchu' say, watchu' say?)
Why you gonna be like that?
Why you gonna be like that?
Is she not gonna take me back?

Why you gonna be like that?
Is she not gonna take me back?
(Said you wanna know, oh oh ohoh, oh oh oh oh.)
Why you gonna be like that?
You ain't gonna have me back
