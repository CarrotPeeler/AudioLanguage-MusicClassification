(Teenagers from Mars)

Well, we land in barren fields
On the Arizona plains
The insemination of little girls
In the middle of wet dreams
We are the angel mutants
The streets for our seduction
Our cause unjust and ancient
In this "B-film" barn invasion

Teenagers from Mars, and we don't care
Teenagers from Mars, and we don't care
Teenagers from Mars, and we don't care

Well, we see your 3D movies
In violent abduction
We blast your mindless structure and
Inferior connection
We take your weak resistance
We throw it in your face
We need no introduction
For mass annihilation

Teenagers from Mars, and we don't care
Teenagers from Mars, and we don't care
Teenagers from Mars, and we don't care

Well, we need no introduction
No visas or carte blanche
Inhuman reproduction
We're here for what we want
We want, we need it, we'll take it
We want, we need it, we'll take it
We want, we need it, we'll take it
We want, we need it, we'll take it (yeah)

Teenagers from Mars, and we don't care
Teenagers from Mars, and we don't care
Teenagers from Mars, and we don't care
Teenagers from Mars, and we don't care
Teenagers from Mars, and we don't care
Teenagers from Mars, and we don't care

Well, we don't care (well, we don't care)
Well, we don't care (yeah, we don't care)
Well, we don't care (well, we don't care)
Well, we don't care
Well, we don't care, we don't care, don'tâ€”
Well, we don't careEmbed
