2 ContributorsRain on the Window LyricsRound about midnight
I feel the chill closin' in
Living my stage fright
I need the sun to begin tomorrow
Thinking â€˜bout my life
And all the changes she made
And when she went running out
All the colors fade to midnight
What a bad week I've had
There's rain on the window
What a bad week I'm sad
There's rain on my window
Will I be staying
Or am I moving in
Am I still standing
I've gotta wait, she's choosing
What a bad week I've had
There's rain on the window
What a bad week I'm sad
There's rain on the window
When the sun comes up
It dries that rain on the window
When the sun comes up
It dries that rain on the window
When the sun comes up
It dries that rain on the window
You might also likeWhat a bad week I've had
There's rain on the window
What a bad week I'm sad
There's rain on the window
When the sun comes up
It dries that rain on the window
When the sun comes up
It dries that rain on the window
When the sun comes up
It dries that rain on the windowEmbed
