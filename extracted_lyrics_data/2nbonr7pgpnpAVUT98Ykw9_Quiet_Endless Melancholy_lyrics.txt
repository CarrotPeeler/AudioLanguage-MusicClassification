1 ContributorThe Path of Melancholy Lyrics
Another grey day, surrounded by darkness
Even if the sun is shining, it is cold and bleak
People are walking around without a goal, just senselessly
They don't look into each other's faces, they don't speak
Trees can't breathe anymore, animals are disappearing
Children remain children, they don't grow up
No love is given, just sorrow will be found
I hope that it will be better someday, so I carry the pain
Some people believе in different kind of gods
Some pеople believe in miracles, signs, heaven and hell
Some people believe in sin, goodness and the bible
But nobody asks for meaning or reason
Other ones believe in humanity, but they don't understand it
Some people believe in money and fame, but they don't need them
Some people believe in art, science, love and heroism
But who appreciate this nowadays?

And while I'm writing this, I'm dreaming of being another person
I keep on crying and keep on blaming someone else
But it's me who's causing all the problems
I try just to live like I am, but people don't accept me
I don't wanna change, but I don't have a choice
I just don't want to be ignored anymore
I want to be a part of this world
I can't run away anymore; I wish I could tell them what I think
But they wouldn't listen to me
You might also like
Some people seem to hate me, but why?
Are they envious? Are they afraid of their self-confidence?
Do they need to humiliate someone to become happy?
If this is true, it's a very sad world
People look at me, they are laughing behind my back
Wrong stories, wrong assumptions, they don't know me
But they are too tired to search for the truth and my sorrow will go on
It always hurts the people who've done nothing bad
Maybe I'll find my destiny on the path of melancholy
All the sadness and madness will be collected there
Maybe I find the answers to my questions there
It's a long and hard way, but I have to reach it
Day after day I'm getting nearer
It's the only way to find myself becoming happy
Maybe one day I could wake up with a smile on the face
Maybe one day other people would really love me

And while I'm writing this, I'm searching for the path of melancholy
I keep on crying and keep on blaming someone else
But it's me who's causing all the problems
I try just to live like I am, but people don't accept me
I don't wanna change, but I don't have a choice
I just don't want to be ignored anymore
I want to be a part of this world
I can't run away anymore; I wish I could tell them what I think
But they wouldn't listen to me
I crossed a lake of tears, filled with tears of sad people
They walk around, nobody wants to help them
How many times must someone cry, before other ones will listen?
How could he fill a whole lake with his tears without being noticed?
I finally reached the path of melancholy, it's dark and quiet
A lonely road leads into an endless forest, without any human soul around
The sky is getting scarier and scarier, but I can't go back anymore
Now I have to face the truth deep inside of us all
I entered the forest; people were hanging from their gallows on the trees
Here lie all the shattered illusions of this mad world
People thought they would make it, they would become something better
But they realised there is no hope, suicide became their saviour
Some people tried to escape from the torment
They fled into each other's arms
So love was found and joy was born
But people died with a broken heart and their bodies lay on the dirty ground below the autumn storm

And while I'm writing this I'm traveling along the path of melancholy
I keep on crying and keep on blaming someone else
But it's me who's causing all the problems
I try just to live like I am, but people don't accept me
I don't wanna change, but I don't have a choice
I just don't want to be ignored anymore
I want to be a part of this world
I can't run away anymore; I wish I could tell them what I think
But they wouldn't listen to me
And while I'm writing this I'm traveling along the path of melancholy
I keep on crying and keep on blaming someone else
But it's me who's causing all the problems
I try just to live like I am, but people don't accept me
I don't wanna change, but I don't have a choice
I just don't want to be ignored anymore
I want to be a part of this world
I can't run away anymore; I wish I could tell them what I think
But they wouldn't listen to meEmbed
