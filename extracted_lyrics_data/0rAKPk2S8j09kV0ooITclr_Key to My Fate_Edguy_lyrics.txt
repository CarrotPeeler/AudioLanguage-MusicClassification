3 ContributorsKey to My Fate LyricsAm I totally blind this time
As I'm dreamin' the dreams that I fear
Some call it nightmare and some call it life
What'ss the sense of existance in here
And I think of the sadness
When I'm dreaming of leaving my pain
I don't get all that madness
But it drives me insane
Now hear me cry
I am in quest of the key to my fate
I might be nigh
To the key in the valley of hate
I don't know
Annihilation in my brain
What is the price that we will be to pay
When will you lift our poor little souls
Will you take us, oh, lord, away
Oh, when will we die
Why to suffer to stay up right
We are victims of our time
We have to fight till the end is in sight

I am in quest of the key to my fate
I might be nigh
To the key in the valley of hate
Now hear me cry
I am in quest of the key to my fate
I might be nigh
To the key in the valley of hate
I don't know
What's the reason to carry on
What's the reason to fall
After days of living hell
After we had to crawl
Are we totally blind this time
Can't you tell me the nexus of freedom and pain
And desires and hate
And even the holy one
Now hear me cry
I am in quest of the key to my fate
I might be nigh
To the key in the valley of hate
Now hear me cry
I am in quest of the key to my fate
I might be nigh
To the key in the valley of hate
