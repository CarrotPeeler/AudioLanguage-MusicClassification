You never really wanted it
You'll settle for a bit of it
We started with a big bang (Covered over everything)
And now it's coming back again

Hey, don't you feel it now?
I'm my shiny side down
Hey, burning brighter still
And you're getting sick
And you're feeling it

It'll wear you down and wear you down
You chase it, breathing in and out and in and out
They'll push you up against the wall, against the wall
You didn't think you'd feel it all but you were wrong about it

Push

It started with a handgun
Loaded with excuses
I started faking it
(And then we started breaking it)
All the pieces used to fit
Using like it's going out of style
(Maybe just a little while)
And this will be the last time
(Every time's the last time)

Hey, don't you feel it now?
I'm my shiny side down
Hey, burning brighter still
And you're getting stuck
And you fucked it up

It'll wear you down and wear you down
You chase it, breathing in and out and in and out
They'll push you up against the wall, against the wall
You didn't think you'd feel it all but you were wrong about it

Push

I regretted it
I regret a lot of things
I regretted it
I regret a lot of things

And if you let it it'll wear you down and wear you down
(I regretted it)
You chase it, breathing in and out and in and out
(I regret a lot of things)
They'll push you up against the wall, against the wall
(I regretted it)
You didn't think you'd feel it all but you were wrong
(I regret a lot of things)
About it
(I regret a lot of things)
They'll push you up against the wall, against the wall
(I regretted it)
You didn't think you'd feel it all but you were wrong
(I regret a lot of things)
And if you let it it'll wear you down and wear you down
You chase it, breathing in and out and in and out
They'll push you up against the wall, against the wall
You didn't think you'd feel it all but you were wrong about it
