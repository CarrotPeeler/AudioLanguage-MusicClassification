2 ContributorsLeaden Winged Burden LyricsNo words can help me
Down here, I dwell
Recollect, must forget
Try to sleep, in too deep
It stains my soul, it hurts to know
Down below the darkness grow
I burned my wings for less than nothing
I failed to see, forgot to breathe
I am to blame, breathing the shame
It sickens my heart, it tears me apart
Cursed by the sun, what have I done?
I am to blame, breathing the shame
It sickens my heart, it tears me apart
O burden let go, help me to grow
I don't deserve, your precious words
Their haunting me, they disagree
I can't see, I can't believe
In this world, better leaveYou might also likeEmbed
