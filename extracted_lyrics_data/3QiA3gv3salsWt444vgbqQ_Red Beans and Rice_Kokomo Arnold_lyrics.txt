1 ContributorRed Beans and Rice LyricsWhen I was down in Georgia, I was doing mighty well
Since I been here in Chicago, I been catching a plenty hell
Says I'm going down to the station, ain't going to take no one's advice
Says I'm going back to Georgia, where I can get my red beans and rice
Now these Chicago women, have give me such a hard way to go
Says they done took all my black money, and they got me running from door to door
Now I been setting here looking, way down that lonesome road
Says I'm raggedy and I'm hungry, and I ain't got no place to go
Now I been rolling, I been rolling from sun to sun
Says I got where I can't get no loving, not until my payday comesYou might also likeEmbed
