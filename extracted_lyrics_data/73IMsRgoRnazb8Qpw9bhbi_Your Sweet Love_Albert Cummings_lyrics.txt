1 ContributorYour Sweet Love LyricsI would climb the highest mountain
I would swim across the sea
Just to feel your sweet love
And what it does to me
And what it does to me
And what it does to me
Well you must have some kind of gift babe
To do the things you do
I would do anything
Just to be with you
Just to be with you
Just to be with you
You have no - no idea babe
Of how you make me feel
Sometimes I have to pinch myself
Because it can't be real
Because it can't be real
Because it can't be real
I gotta tell you babe
That you - you look so fine
I need to have your sweet love
Baby all the time
Baby all the time
Baby all the time
Baby all the timeYou might also likeEmbed
