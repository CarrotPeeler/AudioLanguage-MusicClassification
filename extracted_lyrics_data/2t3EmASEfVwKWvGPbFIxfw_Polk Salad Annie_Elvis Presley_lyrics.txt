Some of y'all never been down South too much
I'm going to tell you a little story, so you'll understand what I'm talking about
Down there we have a plant that grows out in the woods and the fields
And it looks something like a turnip green
Everybody calls it polk salad
Now that's polk salad
Used to know a girl that lived down there and
She'd go out in the evenings and pick a mess of it
Carry it home and cook it for supper, because that's about all they had to eat
But they did all right

Down in Louisiana
Where the alligators grow so mean
Lived a girl that I swear to the world
Made the alligators look tame

Polk Salad Annie
Gators got your granny
Everybody said it was a shame
'Cause her mama was a-working on the chain-gang
A mean, vicious woman

Every day before suppertime
She'd go down by the truck patch
And pick her a mess of polk salad
And carry it home in a tow sack
You might also like
Polk Salad Annie
Gators got your granny
Everybody said it was a shame
'Cause her mama was a-working on the chain-gang
A wretched, spiteful, straight razor toting woman
Lord, have mercy

Sock a little polk salad to me
(You know a need a real mess of it)

Her daddy was lazy and a no-count
Claimed he had a bad back
All her brothers were fit for
Was stealing watermelons out of my truck patch

Polk Salad Annie
Gators got your granny
Everybody said it was a shame
'Cause her mama was a-working on the chain-gang

Sock a little polk salad to me
You know a need a real mess of it
You sock a little
(Hey, hey, hey, yeah, yeah)
(Chic-a-boom, chic-a-boom, chic-a-boom-boom-boom-boom-boom-boom)
(Chic-a-boom, chic-a-boom, chic-a-boom-boom-boom-boom-boom-boom)
Sock a little polk salad to me
You know I need a real mess of it
Sock a little polk salad to me
You know I need a real mess of it
