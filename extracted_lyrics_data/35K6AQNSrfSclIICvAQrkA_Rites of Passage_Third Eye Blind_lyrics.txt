4 ContributorsRites of Passage Lyrics
Break ups, blowjobs, and black eyes
Basements and goodbyes now
And you're all freaked out
Trying to find out what your life's about
In your soul, there's a broken bone
Cause you're so far, so far from home
And you got let down by Occupy
Can't find the ties that bind
I wish I could help you through this phase
It's like Bowie says
You pretty young things
You go through ch-ch-changes
Don't take the road they left behind us
Don't let them find us

Something you can't come back from
Something's lost and something's won
What's done is done
Move on to another one
It's rites of passage
It's just rites of passage
See Third Eye Blind LiveGet tickets as low as $84You might also like
I used to think my thoughts were depraved
Too low to be saved
All shadow and shade
So scared for even thinking
Even diamond dogs have their days
It's like Bowie says
You pretty young things
You go through ch-ch-changes
Don't take the road they left behind us
Don't don't let them find us (don't let them find us)

Something you can't come back from
Something's lost and something's won
What's done is done
Move on to another one
Rites of passage (rites of passage)
It's just rites of passage (rites of passage)
Rites of passage (rites of passage)
It's just rites of passage (rites of passage)
Can't stop it coming now to you
Life's knowing that you're gonna die
Something you can't come back from
Something's lost and something's won
This pain's the same now for everyone
It's rites of passage
It's just rites of passage
Rites of passage
It's rites of passage

(Something you can't come back from)
Break ups, blowjobs, and black eyes
(Something's lost and something's won)
Make the bond and say goodbye
(What's done is done)
Move on to another one
Rites of passage (rites of passage)
It's rites of passage (rites of passage)
It's just rites of passage (rites of passage)
I wish I could help you through this phase


Yeah that's not the one
Yeah that's not the one
Yeah that's not the one
Woah oh woah oh
Yeah that's not the one
Woah oh woah oh
I believe that all believe in one
I believe that all believe in one
Woah oh woah oh
In that one one one oneEmbed
