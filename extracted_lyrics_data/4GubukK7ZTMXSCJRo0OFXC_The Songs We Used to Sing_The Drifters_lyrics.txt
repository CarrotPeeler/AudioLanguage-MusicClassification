2 ContributorsThe Songs We Used to Sing LyricsI know that you told the preacher "I do"
And then he said that we two are "one", now
And that was the day happiness came to stay
But it's taken away all the fun, now
And so
Tonight, we're gonna meet on the corner
Kissin' – forget that ring!
And sing the songs we used to sing
We'll rock around the clock, yeah
We'll let the good times roll, baby (Rollin', rollin')
We're gonna dance, dance, dance
Upon blueberry hill, we'll stroll
You'll be my party doll
I'll wear my blue suede shoes
We'll take the ship of love, now
Into the lavender blue, dilly dilly (dilly dilly)
Our love is strong, but we need the ensembles
And the thrill that has long departed
It's no disgrace going back to the place
When the fun and the chase was started
And so
Tonight, we're gonna meet on the corner
Kissin' – forget that ring!
And sing the songs we used to sing

I wanna hold your hand, hand, hand
And under the boardwalk, we'll write
Love letters in the sand, yeah!
You got kisses sweeter than wine
You're still my teenage prayer (You're still my teenage prayer)
Yes, and love me tender
I'll be your teddy bear! Awright!
And so
Tonight, we're gonna meet on the corner
Kissin' – forget that ring!
And sing the songs we used to sing
Alright, feels good
Yeah, we're gonna sing the songs we used to sing
C'mon! Dance with me, baby!
Yeah, we're gonna sing the songs we used to sing
C'mon! Dance with me, baby!
Yeah, we're gonna sing the songs we used to sing
Oh, it sure feels good!Embed
