6 ContributorsNovember Rain (Piano Version) Lyrics


(Aah, aah, aah, aah)
(Aah, aah, aah, aah)


When I look into your eyes
I can see a love restrained
(Aah, aah, aah, aah)
But when I'm holdin' you
Don't you know I feel the same
(Aah, aah, aah, aah)
But nothin' lasts forever
And we both know hearts can change
(Aah, aah, aah, aah)
Cause it's hard to hold a candle
In the cold November rain
(Aah, aah, aah, aah)
You might also like
We've been through this such a long, long time
Just tryin' to kill the pain
(Aah, aah, aah, aah)
Oooh, yeah
But lovers always come and lovers always go
And no one's really sure who 's lettin' go today
(Aah, aah, aah, aah)
Walking away
If we could take the time
To lay it on the line
I could rest my head
Just knowin' that you were mine
(Aah, aah, aah, aah)
All mine
So if you want to love me
Then darlin' don't refrain
(Aah, aah, aah, aah)
Or I'll just end up walkin'
In the cold November rain
(Aah, aah, aah, aah)

Do ya' need some time on your own
Do ya' need some time all alone
Everybody needs some time
On their own
Oooh, don't you know you need some time all alone


I know it's hard to keep an open heart
Mm-oooh, when even friends seem out to harm you
But if you could heal a broken heart
Wouldn't time be out to charm you
Oh, oh, oh, oh

(Aah, aah, aah, aah)
(Aah, aah, aah, aah)
(Aah, aah, aah, aah)
(Aah, aah, aah, aah)


(Aah, aah, aah, aah)
(Aah, aah, aah, aah)


We been through this such a long, long time
Just tryin' to kill the pain
(Aah, aah, aah, aah)
Ooh, yeah
But lovers always come and lovers always go
And no one's really sure who 's lettin' go today
(Aah, aah, aah, aah)
Walking away
If we could take the time
To lay it on the line
I could rest my head
Just knowin' that you were mine
(Aah, aah, aah, aah)
All mine
So if you wawna' love me
Then darlin' don't refrain
(Aah, aah, aah, aah)
Or I'll just end up walkin'
In the cold November rain
(Aah, aah, aah, aah)


Said I'll just keep on walkin'
Ooh, again, and again, and again, and again
(Again, and again, and again, and again, and again)
Said I know, I'll just keep on walkin'
Ooh, again, and again, and again, and again
(Again, and again, and again, and again, and again)

So, if you want to love me, then darlin don't refrain
(Aah, aah, aah, aah)
Or I'll just keep on walkin' in the cold November rain
(Aah, aah, aah, aah)Embed
