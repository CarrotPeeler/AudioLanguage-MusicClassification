People make mistakes
Comes as no surprise
People break your heart
Can't look you in the eye
People need forgiveness, I'll tell you why
I'll tell you why and I've been there
Don't make light if you don't care
Because you just might fall
And need some understanding
The world can be so cold
I can't tell you why
It's hard to see it straight
With teardrops in your eyes
Get pushed until you break
No one by your side
Thе world can bring you down
I'll tell you why
I'll tell you why and I've been thеre
Don't make light if you don't care
Because you just might fall
And need some understanding
You might also likeYou got to share around some loving
With each other
There comes a time when we all need it
In our lives
People stand and cry
I can't tell you why
Watch the world roll by
Their oceans have run dry
And people hide there faces
You can't catch their eyes
People need forgiveness, I'll tell you why
I'll tell you why and I've been there
Don't make light if you don't care
Because you just might fall
And need some understandingEmbed
