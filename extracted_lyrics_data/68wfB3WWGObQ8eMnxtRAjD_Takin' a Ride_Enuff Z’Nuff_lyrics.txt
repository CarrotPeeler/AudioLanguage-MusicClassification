2 ContributorsTakinâ€™ a Ride Lyrics
(Ah, ah, ah)
(Ah, ah, ah)
(Oh)
(Ah, oh)

Rollin' on down out of my mind
(Oh-oh)

Everything's fine, takin' a ride
Everything's fine, takin' a ride
Everything's fine, takin' a ride
(Oh-oh)

Watching the world pass me by
(Oh-oh)
So high (we're so high)


Everything's fine, takin' a ride
Everything's fine, takin' a ride
Everything's fine, takin' a ride
Everything's fine, takin' a ride
