1 ContributorSomeone To Blame LyricsYou were so quick to say good-bye
So tell me did you even try?
You burned a hole in my disguise
And left a scar larger than life
I guess, we're victims of a circumstance
So please conceal the evidence
If we should need someone to blame
Let's just make up some funny names
For someone to blame
Can't we pretend this ain't the end?
Until we break we've got the truth to bend
Let's leave the details all behind
My dear, you know I wouldn't mind
I guess, we're victims of a circumstance
So please conceal the evidence cause you know
If we should need someone to blame
Let's just make up some funny names
It's alright
To wash our doubts away
If we can spend another day
Got someone to blame
