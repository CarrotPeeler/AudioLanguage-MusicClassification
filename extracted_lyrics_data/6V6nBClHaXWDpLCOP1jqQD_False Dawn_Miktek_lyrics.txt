('bout the only time the man spoke without false tongue anyway)
(right?)
(Anyhow, what you can you do anyway?)

WCDP in the morning hours, the early morning hours
We have quite a few listeners out there
We just gave away two tickets, and a car to a caller number 19
Keep the calls coming, keep them calls coming, keep them calls comingEmbed
