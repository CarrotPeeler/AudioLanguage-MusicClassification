Three 6 Mafia, put your money where your mouth is boy
If you really wanna do somethin' (Shut the fuck up)

Bitch I got money, I got clothes
I got whips, I got hoes
I got money, I got clothes
I got whips, I got hoes
Bitch I got money, I got clothes
I got whips, I got hoes
I got money, I got clothes
I got whips, I got hoes

I'm ridin' tall on 24's, spittin' game out to the hoes
With my windows tinted black, make you think you saw a ghost
Car whole painted white on white, inside leather white on white
Chiefin', drankin' up all night, ballin' out, yeah that's the life
Ladies wanna roll with me, blow a bag of 'dro with me
Party to the crack of dawn, when I'm down in yo' city
I'm all about this pimpin', when it comes to women
Get some head while drivin', mayne, oh what a feelin'

Bitch I got money, I got clothes
I got whips, I got hoes
I got money, I got clothes
I got whips, I got hoes
Bitch I got money, I got clothes
I got whips, I got hoes
I got money, I got clothes
I got whips, I got hoes
You might also like
Here I am so fresh, so, so clean
Off in the club, aww shit I see I blew the ho's brain
Befo' I came, I say I blew a whole thang
Clean as a dollar, off in my black-on-black Impala
The Don Dada, is what they call me overseas
But over here I should say I'm the king of Memphis, Tennessee
Rap, is a wrap, haters wrapped off in my duct tape
What it take I say I been hard since first mixtape
Face get your G's up, way, way up to my level
Higher than the clouds where my daddy restes in heaven
But on another note I'm so stylish I changed the name
I surpassed clean, like a baby, I'm clean, clean

Bitch I got money, I got clothes
I got whips, I got hoes
I got money, I got clothes
I got whips, I got hoes
Bitch I got money, I got clothes
I got whips, I got hoes
I got money, I got clothes
I got whips, I got hoes

Ay let me tell you niggas somethin'
Let me tell you somethin' nigga
That paper is like trash nigga, throw that shit out (throw that shit out)
Throw that shit out (throw that shit out), throw that shit out (throw that shit out)
That paper is like trash nigga, throw that shit out (throw that shit out)
Throw that shit out (throw that shit out), throw that shit out (throw that shit out)
We got - big rims, big cars, big guap, ghetto stars
In the hood, gettin' rich, gettin' it, livin' large
Sellin white, sellin' pills, sellin' crystal meth, meth
Sellin D's, sellin' speed 'til there's nothin' left, left
Fresh clothes, pullin' hoes, get my roll on (roll on)
Phone ringin' off the hook, bitch hold on (hold on)
I got a brand new woofer, put some more hoes on
So I can hit the club, strip, and get chose on

Bitch I got money, I got clothes
I got whips, I got hoes
I got money, I got clothes
I got whips, I got hoes
Bitch I got money, I got clothes
I got whips, I got hoes
I got money, I got clothes
I got whips, I got hoes1Embed
