Man on the wall with green eyes
I think he’ll do
Wanna be my fix, just for the night?
You can’t refuse
Take my hand and take my heart
It’s all blue
Warm me up with what you can’t buy
Free when its true

Slipping away, slipping away
You’re slipping on me
So I’m running away, running away, baby
Ahead of the game, ahead of the blame
Revenge on the street
Getting even never did me good

Oh Oh This is what you do to me
Oh Oh This is what you do to me
Oh Oh Look at what you did to me
Did to me, whoa

Girl on the wall with brown eyes
I think she’ll do
Dancing at the еnd of the start
Deja vu (deja vu)
Takе my hand and take my heart
It’s all bruised
Pour me up my medicine
It’s all you (you, you, you, you)
You might also like
Slipping away, slipping away
You’re slipping on me
So I’m running away, running away, baby
Ahead of the game, ahead of the blame
Revenge on the street
Getting even never did me good

No bleeding love on the floor tonight (M
Paradise lost in neon lights (Murder!)
No fear until the lurk of dawn (Murder!)
Morning comes, another wake up call


Oh oh the criminal inside of me
Shows insatiable wherever she
Goes, taking control of me
Own enemy, no!
Oh oh this is what you do to me
Oh oh this is what you do to me
Oh oh look at what you did to me
Did to me
