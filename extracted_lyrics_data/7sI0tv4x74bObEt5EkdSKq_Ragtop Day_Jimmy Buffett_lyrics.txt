3 ContributorsRagtop Day Lyrics
The five o'clock Friday blows, I got to let it go
Put on my weekend clothes, turn on the rock 'n' roll
Throw all our cares away
It's a ragtop day, it's a ragtop day

Classy little white and red turns everybody's head
My baby meets me at the five and dime, she's always right on time
We roll all our cares away
It's a ragtop day, it's a ragtop day

We'll cruise across the county line
A little dance and dine, a drive-in picture show
When the midnight's comin' down
We're headin' back to town, she lets her lovin' show

Feels like we're the only ones to see the mornin' sun
Sleepin' through the afternoon and risin' with the moon
Oh, don't the stars look bright?
It's a ragtop night, it's a ragtop night

We'll throw all our cares away
I live for that ragtop day, it's a ragtop day
It's a ragtop day, it's a ragtop day

Ooh, come on over here, baby, get in this car
We gonna cruise on down to the gulf
And listen to some western music
Get ourselves a cool one at the Florabama, yeah
All right come on in here, yeah!
You can move over little closer
Ooh, be careful with that stick shift!
Ya, let's rockit ragtime
Was that your husband that just passed us in that station wagon fulla kids?
Let's get outta here, ow!Embed
