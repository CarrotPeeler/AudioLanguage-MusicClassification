Last night, I cried myself to sleep
For the one that made me weep
I've dried my eyes to greet the day
I wonder why I had to pay
Tears that I have shed by day
Give relief and wash away
The memory of the night before
I wonder if I'll suffer more


I wonder if I care as much
As I did before, ooh, oohYou might also likeEmbed
