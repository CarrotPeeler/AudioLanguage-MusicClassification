So many people/Gettin' down for the cause
Booties are shakin', but we ain't breakin' any laws
The whole world/Got it in my hand like a mic
Rollin' hard/Like a bum on a bike
We gotta have money/Don't need the bling bling
You know the deal, who's got the real thing?
It's us, that's who, the PJ Crew
Gonna drop new shit like d√©ja vu
From my mouth to the mic, through the cord to the speaker
To the ears of the average def rhyme seeker
Your knees get weaker, body starts to shiver
Gonna lift your soul when the rhyme is delivered

Rhythmatic/Systematic/Mic control
Magnetic/Kinetic/To lift your soul (x4)
You might also like
From my mouth to the mic, through the cord to the speaker
To the ears of the average def rhyme seeker
Your knees get weaker, body starts to shiver
Gonna lift your soul when the rhyme is delivered
Warzone crashin'/The enemy's hostile
Take no prisoners/It's the old-school new style
Boot camp/Done that/Ready for the mission
Climbin' through the ranks/We got steady ambition
Aerial assault, ground troops attack
Bomb from above goin' clickity-clack
Fight for the right/Free speech on the mic
Oh yeah, motherfucker, that's the shit I like

Rhythmatic/Systematic/Mic control
Magnetic/Kinetic/To lift your soul (x4)

Nappin' while you're rappin', get tapped on out
Caught sleepin' while you're creepin', get knocked the fuck out
You are now listening to the invincible crew
Paid dues, sang blues, yo I thought you knew
This style is ours, it can't be yours
Play pranks like Tom Hanks and no yes sirs
Mechanisms Rocking so shut your mouth
Smoke dank, sip your drank, now let me hear you shout
Rhythmatic/Systematic/Mic control
Magnetic/Kinetic/To lift your soul (x4)

To lift your soul (x4)Embed
