2 ContributorsGuilty As Charged LyricsOne, two, three, four
Guilty as charged
The only ending
That could ever be
I stand alone
Guilty as charged
I played with fire
The only way to change it
Is to kill the truth
Guilty as charged
Bring on the armies
Comin' down to take
My bones and skin away
Guilty as charged
Consumed by envy
Stuff a washrag in my mouth
It's a somber day
Stuff a washrag in my mouth
It's a somber dayYou might also likeEmbed
