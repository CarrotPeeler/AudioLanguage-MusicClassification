1 ContributorToo Much To Lose (chapter 7) LyricsHe woke up in a sweat
With a fading dream
But one picture still stood clear
And he wasn't sure if he could see it any other way
They're like a tiny dot
On an endless page
Just waiting to be erased
And it was clear to him they were treating it like a game

You've got too much to lose
You've got too much to lose
He looked out on the field
They were hard at work
Like locusts in flight
And it almost looked as though they liked what they had to do
The sound of metal being shaped
To enable it's flight
Not that far away
And as the numbers grew, their swarm blackened his view
