A curse, rotting in my vein, venom drips from 7 tongues
A presence fills the air, a burden I can't bear
Dressed in blackened scales
The brain eater mamlambo
Urgh
This gift given birth by burden, the bones have now determined, the direction of my intentions (intentions)
Divination, passed down through past generations, a magnitude of thoughts and symbols forced into my head
Sizobona ngamathambo Qapelani umamlambo
Initiation into madness
A trial of shadows
Trapped in the serpent's embrace
Sacred divinity
Ancient being
Abominable snake
The lamb, given the knife, the sheep now sacrificed
The abuser chosen for this malevolent
Deed
An internal agony, its burden weighs on me
A decision must be made to please the baneful
7 heads, a serpent born, for the purpose of blood and scorn
A curse, rotting in my vein, venom drips from 7 tongues
A presence fills the air, a burden I can't bear
Dressed in blackened scales
The brain eater mamlambo
The 7 headed serpent The 7 headed snake
I offer you my father And i have sealed my fate
Sizobona ngamathambo Qapelani umamlambo
Initiation into madness
A trial of shadows
In my weakened state, the bones have seen proof of my regret. The sins committed have transcended my arrogance my write to power
Before long the serpent picks up the scent of unbridled cowardice. Unrivaled in
Malignancy it sinks its teeth into my soul, it eats me whole
7 heads, a serpent born, for the purpose of blood and scorn
A curse, rotting in my vein, venom drips from 7 tongues
A presence fills the air, a burden I can't bear
Dressed in blackened scales
The brain eater has
7 heads, a serpent born, for the purpose of blood and scorn
A curse, rotting in my vein, venom drips from 7 tongues
A presence fills the air, a burden I can't bear
Dressed in blackened scales
