The night is young
The mood is mellow
And there's music in my ears
Say, is Vic there?
I hear ringing in the air
So I answer the phone
A voice comes over clear
Say, is Vic there?


The night is young
The mood is mellow
And there's music in my ears
Say, is Vic there?
I hear ringing in the air
So I answer the phone
A voice comes over clear
Say, is Vic there?

The night is young
The mood is mellow
And there's music in my ears
Say, is Vic there?
