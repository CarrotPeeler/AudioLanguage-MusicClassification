13 ContributorsSo Gone Lyrics

I'm a do my thing
I'm a do, I'm a do, I'm a do my thing

I was born at the end of december
Not afraid that the cold of the winter
Would keep me inside, hey
Ever since mama left me at home
I had to search for a class of my own
And go there in my mind

I had a dream like Dr. King
I had a song I had to sing
And I knew it wasn't make believe
When the teacher said to me
Baby, who do you wanna be
Said I don't know but I know that I'm a gonna leave

I'm so gone (Just you)
All I do is walk alone (Just me)
I'm so gone (Just you)
I can make it on my own (Just me)
Alright
See John Legend LiveGet tickets as low as $42You might also like
Everybody wanna follow the crowd
But I belong in the front singing loud
And I'll go solo, hey
But the fame is a hell of a temptress
Not my wife but I guess she's a mistress, oh
Can I let her go

She can play tricks on your mind
Have you leave your soul behind
She's turned some niggas out
But she can't keep her spell on me
She can't keep blackmailing me
I'm free to leave, to be just me

I'm so gone (Just you)
All I do is walk alone (Just me)
I'm so gone (Just you)
I can make it on my own (Just me)
Alright

So many (So many people tryna be somebody else)
Tryna be somebody else (Or whatever sells)
I've got my own lane (I've got my own lane, I'm driving by myself)
Hope you wish my well
I'm so gone (Just you)
All I do is walk alone (Just me)
I'm so gone (Just you)
I can make it on my own (Just me)
Alright
I'm so gone (Just you)
All I do is walk alone (Just me)
I'm so gone (Just you)
I can make it on my own (Just me)
Alright

If I fall then let me fall, yea yea yea
Oh cause I only got myself to blame
Oh it's just me
All I do is walk alone2Embed
