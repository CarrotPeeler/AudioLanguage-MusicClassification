3 ContributorsFake Pain LyricsI just wish it would rain
Me, me in bells in the belly
Be, be in two bells in the belly
In someone else's heaven
(Pain, oh yeah, people this hurt I feel inside)
The ultimate, someone help me
(Pain, oh yeah, people this hurt I feel inside)
The ultimatum heaven
(Pain, oh yeah, people this hurt I feel inside)
Everything you've blacked out, they're lovin' it
Pain, pain, pain, pain, pain, pain, oh yeah
Pain, pain, pain, pain, pain, pain, oh yeah
Pain, pain, pain, pain, pain, pain, oh yeah
Getting quieter in here
Don't care now
Mistress of demons
Just like nightmares
She called out
Fuck this mattress, can't do it
Take a train to Paris in the belly
(Pain, oh yeah, people this hurt I feel inside)
No hell in the belly
Yeah, it's 3 AM in the belly
(Pain, oh yeah, people this hurt I feel inside)
Oh, color
It's the color of money
It's the color of money
Ultimatum
