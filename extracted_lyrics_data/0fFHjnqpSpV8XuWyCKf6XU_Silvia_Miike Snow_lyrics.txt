10 ContributorsSilvia LyricsReached the city steps tonight
Following the power lines
Met a man bar side
With eclipses for eyes
And you tell yourself you won't let them touch
Did I say too much?
Did I say enough?
I don't know, Silvia
I don't know, Silvia
Circle 'round the room still
Have fun breaking my will
I know I can't have you here
With someone else on your skin
And it's all my fault for not getting off
So you made it start, can you make it stop?
You don't know, Silvia
You don't know, Silvia
Silvia
Silvia
Silvia

Following the power lines
And your skin is so white
Underneath the black night
And your voice cries out for the coup de grace
And the lights go out, will there be a trace?
That I loved Silvia?
That I loved Silvia?
That I loved Silvia
Silvia
Silvia
Silvia
That I loved Silvia
Silvia
