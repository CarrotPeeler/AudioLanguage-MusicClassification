1 ContributorOdinâ€™s Spell Lyrics
The first born of the gods called Odin
Eight-legged Sleipnir brought him everywhere
God of death and battle showed no fear
No one stands in his way - don't you dare
Ride on the horizon
Lead the raging force
Destiny is ours
Collect the fallen heroes
Bring them home to Valhalla
I'm under his spell
Down in Oden's realm
The raven were his thoughts, his memory
His spear Gungir, defeated rivals well
The Fenriswolf erased his breed
He swallowed Odin - They went to hell
Ride on the horizon
Lead the raging force
Destiny is ours
Collect the fallen heroes
Bring them home to Valhalla

Down in Odin's realm
Ride on the horizon
Lead the raging force
Destiny is ours
Collect the fallen heroes
Bring them home to Valhalla
I'm under his spell, down in Odin's realm
Down, down, down in Odin's realm
Down, down, down
Down, down, down in Odin's realm
Down, down, down

Odin, the King of Gods lived in Valhalla
He and his brothers created the world
And the first human beings. Odin
Sacrificed one of his eyes to "Mimer" so
That he could become the wisest of the wise
He was able to change his shape and
Often travelled as a bird, fish or snake
Through all worldsEmbed
