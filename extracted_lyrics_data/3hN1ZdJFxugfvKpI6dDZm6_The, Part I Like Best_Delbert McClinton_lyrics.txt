3 ContributorsThe Part I Like Best LyricsShe can be a tough guy when she needs to
She can be a sweetie when she wants to
She's never in a rush, conspicuous
She makes it look so easy it's ridiculous
The part I like best is when she makes love to me
She likes to bake pies, sky dive
Likes to wear real tight Levis
She bought a kit, built an airplane
Damn thing flies on Butane
But she's at her best when she makes love to me
I'm a lucky guy
She loves me just the way I am
I never need an alibi
'Cause I never do fool around
She likes champagne and when she gets tight
She likes skinny dippin' in the moonlight
She's my beacon, my motivator
She's juicy as a homegrown tomato
She's at her best when she makes love to me
She's at her best when she makes love to meYou might also likeEmbed
