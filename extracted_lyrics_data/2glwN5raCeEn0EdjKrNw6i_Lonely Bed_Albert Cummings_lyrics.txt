1 ContributorLonely Bed LyricsWoman I want to ask you
Why you do that anyway
I thought things were fine
Just yesterday
Woman you've got to tell me
What's going through your head
You know I can't spend one more night sleeping in this lonely bed
Now I lay here thinking
About what you did
I know it was wrong baby
But I'm ready to forget
Baby you got to tell me
What's going through your head
You know I can't spend one more night sleeping in this lonely bed
Tell me baby
What it's gonna be
You gonna come back home
Lord, and stay with me
Or I've got to
Get myself another woman instead
