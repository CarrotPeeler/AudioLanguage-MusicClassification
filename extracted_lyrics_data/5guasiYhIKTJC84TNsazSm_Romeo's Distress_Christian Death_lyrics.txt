Burning crosses on a nіgger's lawn
Burning dollars, what's a house without a home?
Dance in your white sheet glory
Dance in your passion
You talk about sugar on the six-fingered beast
Conversations about the holes in your hands
Walk through the garden of man's desires
Conversations about the kingdom of fire
Conversations about the kingdom of fire

What's that moving in the basement?
What's that moving in the attic?
Who's that walking in the shadows?
Who's that walking in the streets?

Kiss on my hand
After dark, hand for a kiss
After dark, kiss on my hand
Kiss on my hand
Kiss on my hand

Romance in sequence, harmful to the blind
Burning hearts through the top of your skull
Dance in your white sheet glory
Dance in your passion
Your days are numbered with creations in your pocket
Your days are numbered with the love in your eyes
The love in your eyes
Love

What's that moving in the basement?
What's that moving in the attic?
Who's that lying on the altar?
Who's that lying in the streets?

Kiss on my hand
After dark, hand for a kiss
After dark, kiss on my hand
Kiss on my hand
Kiss on my hand
Kiss on my hand

Pull down the sheets
Take off your clothes
Get out of bed
I'm so tired
I'm so tired
Pull down the sheets
Take off your clothes
Get out of bed
I'm so tired
I'm so tired
I'm so tired18Embed
