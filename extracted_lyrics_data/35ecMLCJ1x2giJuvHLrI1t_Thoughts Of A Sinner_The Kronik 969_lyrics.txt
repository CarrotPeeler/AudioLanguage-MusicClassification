1 ContributorThoughts Of A Sinner LyricsVerse-1
Yeah I’m figuring out ripping my soul dribbling doubt sticking my tone
Whipping the pessimistic it is sickening how I win on own
Picturing my future I’m always building my present
I’m sculpting myself in a king I’m always triggering you peasants
What all I’ve done in life is much more darker than you realize
I’m what you watch in the movies I ain't something from your real life
You talk about blood shed you talk about fights
I almost ended my family I don’t even have to lie
I’ve been hung I’ve been cut I’ve been broke n bruised
You talk about depression i can take you to school
You think it is a fancy thing sympathy is everything
Die mother fucker if you can’t handle what is happening
Suicide ain't a joke ain't nothing cowards ever do
Cowards don’t have the balls or the guts to die n live their truth
You find it funny haa I find your fucking life funny
You say a lot online but I don’t see you doing half of it
Hook
Thoughts of a sinner I’ma winner in my own league
Killer with the words I’m the one you call the only
Prepared for the battles I’ma warrior you won’t be
A soldier you won’t beat a prophecy you don’t see
I have fought I’ma winner a sinner that you all need
Killer with the words I’m the one you call the only
Prepared for the wars I’ma warrior you won't be

Now I’ma break it down so you can understand importance
Of not being an asshole on your facebook reporting
Of not being an ass with the girl you’re supporting
Of not being an ass why you’re always revolting
You wanna make a point son you better show us how its done
Else just keep ya god damn mother fucking mouth shut
Else just keep ya ideas n eurekas in ya trunk
Stop behaving like your fucking Shakespeare when you’re drunk
I’ve been handling myself with a bunch of mean punks
Held it together with the worst that has been cursed
Kept all that insanity in pandora’s box
Kept all their reality in a grandfather clock
Kept all that aggression as a gifted possession
Made all their violent processions in a peaceful convention
Its hard to keep’em boys n girls realize reality
But I know how to deal so i help them catch morality

Verse-3
Remembering the past ain't gonna make ya future bright
Regrets that you have ain't gonna help you survive
Repressed are the memories you’re hiding secrets from your enemies
Guilt is taking over you reminding you of every felony
Committed by you when you were on drugs or drunk heavily
Feeling like a tragedy dealing with the fallacies
That you have made up to protect your fucking sanity
As you sink in your lies screaming you cry bleeding you smile
Living in disguise you’ve been dealing in style
Revealing your life as a surprise that you’ve been keeping like wine
Sipping slowly till its over smelling the aroma tasting your truth
Labelling your life like it’s a mother fucking book
I’m done with you crooks I’m calling out you liars
Run mother fuckers I won’t stop or retire

Killer with the words I’m the one you call the only
Prepared for the wars I’ma warrior you won't beEmbed
