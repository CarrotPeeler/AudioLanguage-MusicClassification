4 ContributorsFive Long Years Lyrics>
If you’ve ever been mistreated
Then you know just what I'm talking about
If you’ve ever been mistreated people
Then you know just what I'm talking about
I worked five long years for one man
And he had the nerve to put me out
I’ll tell you what I did now
I got a job as a maid, scrubbing’ floors like a slave
Five long years, I worked hard and I, I gave him all my pay
I think I been mistreated
You know just what I'm talking about
I worked, I worked five long years for one man
And he had the nerve to put me out
> Guitar solo <
I finally lеarned a lesson, took a long, long time ago
Thе next man that I marry
Is gon’ have to work and bring ME the dough
I been mistreated
You know just what I'm talking about
I worked five long years for one man
And he had the nerve to put me out
