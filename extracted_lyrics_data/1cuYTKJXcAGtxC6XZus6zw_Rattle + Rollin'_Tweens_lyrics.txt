Get out of the kitchen and rattle those pots and pans
Well, roll my breakfast 'cause I'm a hungry man
Said shake, rattle and roll
Said shake, rattle and roll
Said shake, rattle and roll
Said shake, rattle and roll
Well, you never do nothing to save your doggone soul
Wear those dresses, your hair done up so nice (so nice)
Wear those dresses and your hair done up so nice
You look so warm 'cause your heart is cold as ice
Said shake, rattlе and roll
Said shake, rattle and roll
Said shake, rattlе and roll
Said shake, rattle and roll
Well, you never do nothing to save your doggone soul
Go!

I'm a one-eyed cat peepin' in a sea food store
I'm a one-eyed cat peepin' in a sea food store
Can look at you 'til you don't love me no more
