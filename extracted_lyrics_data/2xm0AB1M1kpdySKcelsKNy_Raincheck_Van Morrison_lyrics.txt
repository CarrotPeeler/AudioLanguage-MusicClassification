3 ContributorsRaincheck Lyrics
It's not high finance, it's called heart and soul
If it's rock and roll, got to go, go, go, go, go
Gonna keep moving on up to that higher ground
I'm gonna keep on moving on up, I got to stand my ground
I'm gonna keep on moving on up, I wanna stick around

Won't let the bastards grind me down
Won't let the bastards grind me down
Won't let the bastards grind me down

Call me raincheck (Call me raincheck) in the afternoon
Call me raincheck (Call me raincheck), need a shot of rhythm and blues
Call me raincheck (Call me raincheck), on a golden autumn day
Call me raincheck (Call me raincheck), I won't fade away
I won't fade away
I don't fade away
I don't fade away unless I want to

Can't take my love away, ah 'cause it's here to stay
If it fades away, come back another day
I'm gonna keep on moving on up to the higher ground
Gonna keep on moving on up, I wanna stick around
I'm gonna keep on moving on up, oh, gonna stand my ground

Won't let the bastards grind me down
Won't let the bastards grind me down
Won't let the bastards grind me down

My name is raincheck (Call me raincheck) in the afternoon
My name is raincheck (Call me raincheck), need a shot of rhythm and blues
My name is raincheck (Call me raincheck) on a golden autumn day
My name is raincheck (Call me raincheck) and I don't fade away
I don't fade away
I don't fade away
I don't fade away unless I want to

Move it up, move it up, move it up, move it up
Move it up, move it up, move it up, move it up, move it up
Move it up, move it up, move it up, move it up

Grind me down
Grind me down
Grind me down

My name is raincheck (Call me raincheck) in the afternoon
My name is raincheck (Call me raincheck), need a shot of rhythm and blues
My name is raincheck (Call me raincheck) on a golden autumn day
My name is raincheck (Call me raincheck) and I don't fade away
I don't fade away
I don't fade away
I don't fade away unless I want to
Put on your dancing shoes, dance away your blues
When I'm feeling like this, I got nothing to lose
Wanna keep on moving on up to that higher ground
Wanna keep on moving on up and I'll stick around
Wanna keep on moving on up, got to stand my ground

Won't let the bastards grind me down
Won't let the bastards grind me down
Oh, won't let the bastards grind me down

My name is raincheck (Call me raincheck) in the afternoon
My name is raincheck (Call me raincheck), need a shot of rhythm and blues
My name is raincheck (Call me raincheck) on a golden autumn day
My name is raincheck (Call me raincheck) and I don't fade away
I don't fade away
I don't fade away
I don't fade away unless I choose, I choose, I choose, I choose

No, I don't fade away
I don't fade away
I don't fade away unless I choose, I choose, I choose
I choose, I choose, I choose
I choose, I choose, I choose
I choose, I choose, I choose
I choose, I choose, I choose
No, I won't fade away
I won't fade away
I don't fade away
Unless I want toEmbed
