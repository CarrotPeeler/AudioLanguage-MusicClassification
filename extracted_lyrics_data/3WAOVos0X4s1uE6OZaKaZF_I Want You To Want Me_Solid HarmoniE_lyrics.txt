6 ContributorsI Want You to Want Me Lyrics
I want you to want me for all that I am
I hope that you will try to understand
Do you feel the same?
Do you feel the same?

I want you to want me for all that I am
And I'll never leave you behind
I want you to be by my side, you're always on my mind
Baby, am I the only?

We've got to stop this game
Tell me, do you feel the same?

I want you to want me for all that I am
I hope that you will try to understand
Do you feel the same? (do you feel the same?)
Do you feel the same?

Now take a good look, what you see is for real
You know I've got nothing to hide
The way that I am (the way that I am)
Is the way that I feel for you now
Baby, am I the only?
You might also like
We've got to stop this game
Tell me, do you feel the same?

I want you to want me for all that I am
I hope that you will try to understand
Do you feel the same? (do you feel the same?)
Do you feel the same? (do you, do you, baby?)

(Alright)
Everybody knows that I need you
There ain't nothing in the world I wouldn't do
Tell me now, am I the only, baby?
Everybody knows that I need you
There ain't nothing in the world I wouldn't do
Please understand
This is what I am (do you, do you, baby?)

I want you to want me for all that I am
I hope that you will try to understand
Do you feel the same? (do you feel the same?)
Do you feel the same? (am I the only?)
I want you to want me for all that I am
I hope that you will try to understand
Do you feel the same? (do you feel the same?)
Do you feel the same? (do you feel the same?)Embed
