Tell me everything you saw
They had lights inside their eyes
They had lights inside their eyes
Did you see the closing window?
Did you hear the slamming door?
They moved forward, my heart died
They moved forward, my heart died
Please, please tell me what they look like
Did they seem afraid of you?
They were kids that I once knew
They were kids that I once knew
I could say it, but you won't believe me
You say you do, but you don't deceive me
It's hard to know they're out there
It's hard to know that you still care
I could say it but you won't believe me
You say you do but you don't deceive me
Dead hearts are everywhere
Dead hearts are everywhere
Did you touch them, did you hold them?
Did they follow you to town?
They make me feel I'm falling down
They make me feel I'm falling down

Did they seem too real to you?
They were kids that I once knew
They were kids that I once knew
I could say it, but you won't believe me
You say you do, but you don't deceive me
It's hard to know they're out there
It's hard to know that you still care
I could say it but you won't believe me
You say you do but you don't deceive me
Dead hearts are everywhere
Dead hearts are everywhere
I could say it, but you won't believe me
You say you do, but you don't deceive me
It's hard to know they're out there
It's hard to know that you still care
I could say it but you won't believe me
You say you do but you don't deceive me
Dead hearts are everywhere
Dead hearts are everywhere
They were kids that I once knew
They were kids that I once knew
Now they're all dead hearts to you
Now they're all dead hearts to you
They were kids that I once knew
They were kids that I once knew
Now they're all dead hearts to you10Embed
