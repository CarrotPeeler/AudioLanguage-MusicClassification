2 ContributorsKingdom Come LyricsWell, I walked in the pouring rain
And I heard the voice that cries "it's all in vain"
The face of doom was shining in my room
I just need one day somewhere far away
Lord, I just need one day
Well, I'll be breaking these rocks (until the Kingdom comes)
And cuttin' this hay (until the Kingdom comes)
Yes, I'll be breaking these rocks (until the Kingdom comes)
It's my price to pay (until the Kingdom comes)
The river's so muddy, but it may come clear
And I know too well what's keeping me here
I'm just a slave of a burning ray
Give me the night, I can't take another sight
Please give me the night
Well, I'll be breaking these rocks (until the Kingdom comes)
And cuttin' this hay (until the Kingdom comes)
Yes, I'll be breaking these rocks (until the Kingdom comes)
It's my price to pay (until the Kingdom comes)
The sun keeps beating down, the wall's a mile high
Up in the towers they're watching me, hoping I'm gonna die
But they'll open these cells (when the Kingdom comes)
I won't be breaking no rock (when the Kingdom comes)
I said they'll open these cells (when the Kingdom comes)
I won't hear their talk (when the Kingdom comes)
I'm going up for a pardon (when the Kingdom comes)
Well, pardon me (when the Kingdom comes)

I won't be breaking no rock (when the Kingdom comes)
I won't be breaking no rock (when the Kingdom comes)
When the Kingdom comes (when the Kingdom comes)
When the Kingdom comes (when the Kingdom comes)
When the Kingdom comes (when the Kingdom comes)
When the Kingdom comes (when the Kingdom comes)
When the Kingdom comes (when the Kingdom comes)
When the Kingdom comes (when the Kingdom comes)Embed
