And I come back
Niggas tryna flex
Tell me that I'm lost, I'm located in the back, though
Don't even wanna check
Niggas still wanna call it a day
Approach me, ain't got shit to say
Talkin' to me like you wanted to stay
When it come back around and you still tryna play
Go and break it down for a nigga
Go and break it down just a little
Had love for a nigga
But they steady playin' games with a nigga
Steady throwin' names for a nigga
One time for you niggas
And I'm goin' with my stash (Stash)
Tryna make it last (Last)
Thoughts overflow like they did in the past
And with me, they still tryna ask
Fuck you wanna know 'bout me?
Fuck a nigga bitch off a forty-oz
Shit, I keep it lowkey
Many people sayin' that they know it
Like there's plenty of that shit I ain't see
Catch me overseas in a fuckin' white tee
Bitches say, "Lovell, man, I really want the D"
Niggas say, "Lovell, man, I really wanna see"
You all know 'bout me

Stress keeps buildin'
Blood stops flowin'
Brain got me open
Gone off a potion
(Yeah, yeah)
Stress keeps buildin'
Gone off a potion


Stress keeps buildin'
Stress keeps buildin'
Gone off a potion
Gone off a potion
Gone— Gone off a potion80Embed
