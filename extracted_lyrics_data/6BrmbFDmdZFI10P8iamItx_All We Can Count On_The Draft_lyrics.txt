1 ContributorTil the End LyricsDid you see her smile?
He don't even care
If I ever act that way
I'd be wrong, I'd be wrong
And if I share your life
Or, in time, we drift apart
You'll be there in my heart
Time passes on and on
Seasons change, the world goes round
Still, in all, we must go on
I'll be there if you call
'Til the end
I'll be the one that you can count on
'Til the end
And I won't turn away
If I'm down and out
And no one seemed to care
Would you reach your hand to me
And be strong, I'd be strong
Whеn the lights go out
Will I be the only onе
That you hold near your heart?
You might also likeTime passes on somehow
People change, the world goes round
Still, in all, we must go on
I'll be there if you call
'Til the end
I'll be the one that you can count on
'Til the end
And I won't turn away
Another life, maybe, will go on
No one can take your place
I hope to God I can please recall
When we made love
I still see your face
'Til the end
I'll be the one that you can count on
'Til the end
And I won't turn away
'Til the end
I'll be the shoulder you can cry on
'Til the end
And I won't turn away
I never quite figured it out
Just what life is all about
I never did understand
Just wanted you to hold my hand
Just hold my hand
Just one time
Ooh, baby
That I need you to be
I'm gonna want you to be
I'm gonna want you to be with meEmbed
