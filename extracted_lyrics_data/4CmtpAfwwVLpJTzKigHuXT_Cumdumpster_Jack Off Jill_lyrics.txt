6 ContributorsCumdumpster Lyrics
C-c-c-c-call me cumdumpster
C-c-c-c-call me a cunt
C-c-c-call me clever
Is that, still okay?

D-d-d-d-did you watch the TV?
Or hear it on the radio?
Watch out for after school specials
Are we still, okay?
Well, okay!

You call, I'll answer
Make me, understand
How I have, to hate you
That's, quite okay

C-c-c-c-cumdumpster
C-c-c-c-cunt
C-c-c-call me clever
Is that still okay?

D-d-d-d-did you tap the payphone?
Or read it in a magazine?
Becoming after school specials
Are we, still okay?
Well, okay!
You might also like
You call, and I'll answer
Make me, understand
How I have, to hate you
That's, quite okay

C-c-c-c-cumdumpster
C-c-c-c-cunt
C-c-c-call me clever
Is that, still okay?

D-d-d-d-do you, still need me
Now that, I'm a monster?
Paranoid, media frenzy
Tells me, I'm okay!

You call, and I'll answer
Make me, understand
How I have, to hate you
That's quite okay

You call, and I'll answer
You'll ask, and I'll lie
Why I've learned, to hate you
That's quite okay, quite okay!1Embed
