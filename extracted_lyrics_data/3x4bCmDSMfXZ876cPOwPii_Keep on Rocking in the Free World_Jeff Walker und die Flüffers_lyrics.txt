Red, white and blue
Now People shufflin' their feet
Now People sleepin' in their shoes
There's a warnin' sign on the road ahead
There's a lot of people sayin' we'd be better off dead
Don't feel like Satan, but I am to them
You're forced to die everyday 'cuz you didn't have a plan
Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world
I see a woman in the night
With a baby in her arms
Near an old street light
(Near a garbage can)
Near a garbage can
(Near a garbage can)
Now she puts the kid away, and she's gone to get a hit
She hates her life, and what she's done to it
That's one more kid that will never go to school
Never get to fall in love, never get to be cool
Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world

For the homeless man
We got a kinder, gentler
Machine gun hand
We got department stores and toilet paper
Got Styrofoam boxes for the ozone layer
Got a man of the people, says keep hope alive
Got fuel to burn, got roads to drive
Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world
We got a kinder, gentler
Machine gun hand
Keep on rockin' in the free world
We got a kinder, gentler
Machine gun hand
We got a kinder, gentler
Machine gun hand....Embed
