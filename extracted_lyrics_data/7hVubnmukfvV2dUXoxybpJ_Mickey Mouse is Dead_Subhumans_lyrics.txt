10 ContributorsMickey Mouse Is Dead LyricsMickey Mouse is dead
Got kicked in the head
Cos people got too serious
They planned out what they said
They couldn't take the fantasy
They tried to accept reality
Analyzed the laughs
Cos pleasure comes in halves
The purity of comedy
They had to take it seriously
Changed the words around
Tried to make it look profound
The comedian is on stage
Pisstaking for a wage
The critics think he's great
But the laughter turns to hate
Mickey Mouse is on T.V
And the kids stare at the screen
But the pictures are all black and white
And the words don't mean a thing
Cos Mummy's got no money
And Daddy is in jail
He couldn't afford the license
She couldn't afford the bail
You might also likeThe kids out in the road
Their minds have all gone cold
Cos Mickey Mouse is dead
They shot him through the head
With ignorance and scorn
They believed in something new
They read the papers watched the films
And they thought they knew the truth
Look what you've done to Mickey Mouse
But reality deceives
No matter what you believe
There's always another idea
And theirs is based on fear
The fear of being sussed
For what they really are
The fear of being laughed at
When they go too far
They call it paranoia
You can't laugh it away
Until you come to realize
That everyone's the same
People hide their problems
Under faces of contempt
They hide them 'til it kills them
And no one is exempt
Not even you
Look what you done to Mickey Mouse
1, 2, 3, 4, Look what you've done to Mickey Mouse
1, 2, 3, 4, Look what you've done to Mickey Mouse
1, 2, 3, 4, Look what you've done to Mickey Mouse
1, 2, 3, 4, Look what you've done to Mickey Mouse
Why are you even laughing away!1Embed
