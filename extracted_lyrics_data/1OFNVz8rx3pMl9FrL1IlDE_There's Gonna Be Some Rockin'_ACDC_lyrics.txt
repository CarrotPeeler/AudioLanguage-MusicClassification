Three, four
Ya-hoo!

Well, me and the boys, are out to have some fun
Gonna put on a show, come on, let's go

There's gonna be some rockin'
There's gonna be some rockin'
There's gonna be some rockin' at the show tonight

Every night, there's a rock 'n' roll queen
Gonna quiver and quake, gonna shake her thing

There's gonna be some rockin'
There's gonna be some rockin', yeah
There's gonna be some rockin' at the show tonight
It's a rock 'n' roll show


We got a big fat sound, wanna share it 'round
Got a big bass drum, gonna have some fun

There's gonna be some rockin' at the show tonight
Yeah, there's gonna be some rockin' at the show tonight
Oh, there's gonna be some rockin' at the show tonight1Embed
