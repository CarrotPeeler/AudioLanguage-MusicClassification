12 ContributorsCloser Lyrics
Closer to my dreams
Coming over me
I'm getting higher
Closer to my dreams
I'm getting higher and higher
Feel it in my sleep

Sometimes it feels like I'll never go past here
Sometimes it feels like I'm stuck forever, ever (Like I'm stuck forever)

But I'm going higher
Closer to my dreams
I'm going higher and higher
I can almost reach

Sometimes you just have to let it go (Let it go, let go)
Leaving all my fears to burn and die
Push them all away so I can move on
Closer to my dreams
Feel it all over my being, in my being
Close your eyes and seek what you believe
You might also like
I'm moving higher, higher, oh, oh
I'm going higher and higher and higher and higher
Closer to my dreams (Higher and higher, oh, oh)

I'm moving upward and onward and beyond all that I can see
Stretching out my arms so I can reach
I'm so close, it's like I can just reach
I can feel my dreams
Closer to my dreams
I'm moving closer to my dreams
Ooh

Sometimes it feel like you're never gonna change (Never gonna change)
But you never choose to walk away2Embed
