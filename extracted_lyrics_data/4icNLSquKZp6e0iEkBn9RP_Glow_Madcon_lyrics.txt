(Element)

My heart, it beats to your song
A melody sent from God
I can't breathe when you're gone
Yes, I'm deeply in love, ooh (Be my valentine)
Every single day of my life (My heart is sacrificed)
Night and day, day and night

Today is the day (Tonight is the night)
I know you feel a bit sad (I'ma make you glad)
'Cause today is the day (Tonight is the night)
I'ma lay it down (I'ma lay it down)
I'ma get up so I can't get down (I'ma)
Hear me roar in my thunder sound (I'ma)
I'm the lord of the underground (I'ma, I'ma)
Part of the jungle (Part of the jungle; I'ma, I'ma)

Let's glow (Hands high, hands high)
I can't wait, I can't wait to see ya glow (Hands high, hands high)
'Round the world, 'round the world my people glow, glow (I wanna see you; hands high, hands high)
I can't wait, I can't wait to see ya glow (Hands high, hands high)
'Round the world (Glow), 'round the world my people— (Glow)
