Down below
Beneath
I haven’t bellowed “Believe!”
Can’t build what I haven’t seen
Sticks me in the soil
Down below
Beneath
I haven’t bellowed “Believe!”
Can’t build what I haven’t seen
Still got time you know
(Divided and restless in silence and thought)
It’s not your time to go
(Try to get nearer walk around where I walk)
Still got time you know
(Divided and restless in silence and thought)
It’s not your time to go
(Try to get nearer walk around where I walk)
Still got time you know
(Divided and restless in silence and thought)
It’s not your time to go
(Try to get nearer walk around where I walk)
Still got time you know
(Divided and restless in silence and thought)
It’s not your time to go
(Try to get nearer walk around where I walk)
Sticks me in the soil
Down below
Beneath
I haven’t bellowed “Believe!”
Can’t build what I haven’t seen
Sticks me in the soil
Down below
Beneath
I haven’t bellowed “Believe!”
Can’t build what I haven’t seen
Sticks me in the soil
Down below
Beneath
I haven’t bellowed “Believe!”
Can’t build what I haven’t seen
Sticks me in the soil
Down below
Beneath
I haven’t bellowed “Believe!”
Can’t build what I haven’t seen
Still got time you know
(Divided and restless in silence and thought)
It’s not your time to go
(Try to get nearer walk around where I walk)
Still got time you know
(Divided and restless in silence and thought)
It’s not your time to go
(Try to get nearer walk around where I walk)
Still got time you know
(Divided and restless in silence and thought)
It’s not your time to go
(Try to get nearer walk around where I walk)
Still got time you know
(Divided and restless in silence and thought)
It’s not your time to go
