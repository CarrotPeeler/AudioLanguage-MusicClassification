1 ContributorAshes LyricsI am the eye uncovering your world
I am the essence, the entity of all
I once gave birth to you
Just as I will entomb you again
Into the cycle of fathomless creation
A symbiosis of life and death
Turn matter into dust
Storm of dispersion
All that once was is lost
Inversion of the godâ€™s creation
Flames have formed my state
It was you who fed the hunger
Of the starving fire
As sign of my gratitude
I dry your tears with my arid breath
Among the dead I wander
Above the ruins of your world I sweep
Uniting what is asunder
From the highest place down into the deep
Ashes remain, I stain the purification
Swallowed by the rain, back into the initiation
You might also likeI embrace ages of ambiguity
For I embody a terminal certainty
Kings have crossed my path, empires kneeled before me
My strength is all-determining, I prevail at last
Ashes remain
Among the dead I wonder
I prevail at lastEmbed
