And liar after liar
With nothin' bout nothin' higher
I am on the outside peerin' in to your world
And all the boys and girls are singin'
Save me, save me from the one
Who only rapes me
Take away my TV, don't want your fuckin' recipe
It's all decay decay decay
Not today today today
Take away my TV, don't want your fuckin' therapy
It's all decay cecay decay
Not today, not today
It's our world and I'm on fire with anger
And desire not the kind that they feed
To me with their emptiness
And greed greed greed
I don't give a fuck what you say about me
Everything you are is just a tool to me
So just set up the mic and let me do my thing
In the consciousness
Of each and every sentient being
You might also likeRainin' down like a thunderstorm into your mind
Maybe not the first, the second or even the third time
But eventually, you won't be able to put me down
You'll be havin' me with breakfast
In your coffee groundsEmbed
