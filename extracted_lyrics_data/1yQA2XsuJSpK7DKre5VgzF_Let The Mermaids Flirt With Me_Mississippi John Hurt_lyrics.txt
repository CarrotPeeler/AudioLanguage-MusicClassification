Blues all on the ocean
Blues all in the air
Can't stay here no longer
I have no steamship fare

When my earthly trials are over
Cast my body out in the sea
Save all the undertaker bills
Let the mermaids flirt with me

I do not work for pleasure
Earthly peace I'll see no more
The only reason I work at all
Is to drive the wolves from my door

When my earthly trials are over
Cast my body out in the sea
Save all the undertaker bills
Let the mermaids flirt with me

My wife controls our unhappy home
A sweetheart I can not find
The only thing I can call my own
Is a troubled and a worried mind
You might also like
When my earthly trials are over
Cast my body out in the sea
Save all the undertaker bills
Let the mermaids flirt with me

Blues all in my body
My darling has forsaken me
If I ever see her face again
I have to swim across the sea

When my earthly trials are over
Cast my body out in the sea
Save all the undertaker bills
Let the mermaids flirt with me

Blues all on the ocean
Blues all in the air
Can't stay here no longer
I have no steamship fare

When my earthly trials are over
Cast my body out in the sea
Save all the undertaker bills
Let the mermaids flirt with me1Embed
