13 ContributorsChlorine Lyrics
Silhouette of a violet view
Felt it fade, was it too soon?
Hollow, you can't hold it in

Poison in your mood
Chlorine eyes from you

Found your place in a model face
Fell into the violent daze
Hollow, you can't hold it in
Pour out all your emptiness

Poison in your mood
Chlorine eyes from you
Decorated blue
Opening a woundYou might also like7Embed
