All i want to have you round my world
All i want to have you held my arms
Baby won't you stay with me
You know im end to you

For me to you
Thats nothing you can do
For all things that i've done
For all things that i want
Nothings gonna change my mind
Nothings gonna change
All i want to have you round my world
All i want to have you held my arms
Baby won't you stay with me
