You've got a sweet, sweet way
You'll always be the only one
And if you'll let me say
You'll never be a lonely one

Well you've just got something
Makes a girl start feeling crazy
And I'll do anything
If you'll let me be your baby

Even when everybody tells me
I'm just being a fool
Something inside says I've gotta have you
And I can't play by the rules

Oh baby baby
Tell me there's a chance for me
Because I'm crazy about you
I know this is love for me

Well you just got something
Makes a girl start feeling crazy
And I'll do anything
If you'll let me be your baby
You might also like
Just crazy love, just crazy love
Just crazy love, just crazy love
Just crazy love, just crazy love
Just crazy love, just crazy love

Even when everybody tells me
I'm just being a fool
Something inside says I've gotta have you
And I can't play by the rules

Oh baby baby
Tell me there's a chance for me
Because I'm crazy about you
I know this is love for me

Just crazy love, just crazy love
Just crazy love, just crazy love
Just crazy love, just crazy love
Just crazy love, just crazy loveEmbed
