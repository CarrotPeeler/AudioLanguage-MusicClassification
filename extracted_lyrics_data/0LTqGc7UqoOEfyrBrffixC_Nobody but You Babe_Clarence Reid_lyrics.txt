2 ContributorsNobody But You Babe Lyrics
I'm doing my thing
With nobody but you, baby
I'm doing my real thing
With nobody but you, baby

I know a lot of people been telling you this and that
Oh, but don't you listen
'Cause they don't know where it's at
Whenever you need me
Just call, and I'll be there in a hurry
When I'm away, girl, you don't have to worry

'Cause I'm doing my thing, uh
With nobody but you, babe
I'm doing my sweet thing
With nobody but you, baby

Now I know you get lonely, baby, when I'm not around
And I know you're thinking that I'm out on the town
Your friends are saying that I've been untrue
Oh, but listen, baby
Don't you let that bother you
You might also like
'Cause I'm doing my thing, uh
With nobody but you, babe
I'm doing my good thing
With nobody but you, baby
Oh!

I'm doing my thing
With nobody but you, babe
I'm doing my good thing
With no one but you, baby, oh
I'm doing my thing
With nobody but you, babe
Nobody but you, nobody but you
Don't lose it, my foxy lady

Don't lose it, don't lose it
Don't lose it, my foxy ladyEmbed
