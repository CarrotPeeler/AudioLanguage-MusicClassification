3 ContributorsThe Dead LyricsPassing Necrosis
The tunnel of pain is in front
You're passing through dimensions
A life is ended, another is gone
Remember for the last time
Then you'll be erased
Another reich is calling
Your journey has just begun
Close the open door, released from all abhor
Finally unleashed, bodily deceased
Noting but death remains!... You die!
Existing now in other form
After purgatory you were reborn
Still on earth, a dying shell
Burnt to ashes in the flames of christ
You die!
Death is all around you
Every breath can be the last
Drown in thoughts of dying
Your life has gone to fast
You might also likeThe dead is leading the dead
Like the blind is leading the blind
The dead is leading the dead
And the blind is leading the blind
Nothing but death remains!
Nothing but death remains!Embed
