10 ContributorsVictory or Die Lyrics
Victory or Die!

What do you say? What can I ever do for you?
What are we gonna to do to pass the time?
What do you care when you find that life's unfair
Equality is just a state of mind
Believe whatever's right
What's right for you tonight
You know where to draw the line

What have you done? What's in your mind? What do you need?
Where shall we go to let it out
What have you seen, we don't know where you've been
Life so often blows your candle out
Believe in what is right
What's right for you tonight
Who knows what the fuck it's all about

Look up and see the flying saucers
Cruising in the sky, I saw one myself it ain't no lie
Look down and see the road you're on
As if you are on a marathon
That's the spirit, victory or die
You might also like

What did they say what have we learned, what do we know
What shall we do to even up the score?
What do you find, if you find that you've got blind?
Darkness is a thing we've seen before
Believing is your right all right
What ever right you right
We always end up on the killing floor

Look around and see the soldiers
See them marching off to war
Take a careful look as they swing by
They're all heroes, but they don't know what they're fighting for
That's the spirit
Victory or die!

Watch out for the monsters in the alleys of the night
They're always hungry, look them in the eye
They're looking at your daughters
We've seen the flying saucers
You have to tell them
Victory or die!
Or die!Embed
