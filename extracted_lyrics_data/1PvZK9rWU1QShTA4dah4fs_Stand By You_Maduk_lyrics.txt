I , but I stand by you
I was , just to get to you
I , but I stand by you
I will rise up
I'm breaking out of this negative energy, hey
I'm moving on, I've had enough
Remove myself from this negative energy
But I stand by you
I was , just to get to you
I , but I stand by you
I was , just to get to you
I , but I stand by you
I will rise up
I'm breaking out of this negative energy, hey
I'm moving on, I've had enough
Remove myself from this negative energy
But I stand by youYou might also likeEmbed
