1 ContributorThe Ether Lyrics stands like a señorita
In the dark and revolving door
Waiting for the night to greet her
And only what I meant her for 
A hundred miles in the heat and sleet 
And I can't stand one inch more
So I ride
And she hide
Gone into the ether
Left me with a fever
I'm gonna set this, I'm gonna set this place apart
Give you the loving a la carte
Ah, like a white shard in your heart
But I'm weak
And she sleeps
Gone into the ether
Left me with a fever
And I got nothing neither
Gone into the ether
Yeah, huh
Yeah, huh
 stands like a señorita
In the dark and revolving door
Waiting for the night to greet her
Waiting here for her, wait here for...
I walk a hundred miles in the heat and the steamer 
I can't stayYou might also likeEmbed
