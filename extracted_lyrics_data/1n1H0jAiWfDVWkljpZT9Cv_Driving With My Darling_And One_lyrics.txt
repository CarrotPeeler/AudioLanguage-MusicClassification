1 ContributorDriving With My Darling Lyrics
Driving faster
Faster than I should
Driving with my darling

Early Sunday morning
Thousand drinks I've understood
Driving with my darling
Faster as I should

A green man stops me friendly
One look â€“ he starts to smile
He says, "Never let me see your face again"
I'm easy for a while

But I think I'm a fool
Try to breathe underwater

Driving with my darling
Faster than I should
Driving with my darling
(Forever if we could)

Fool is on the road again
So danger isn't far
Bang! Deep green crashing metal
Police just lost a car

But I think I'm a fool
Try to breathe underwater

Driving with my darling
Faster than I should
Driving with my darling
(Forever if we could)

Driving
Driving

But I think I'm a fool
Try to breathe underwater

Driving with my darling
Faster than I should
Driving with my darling
(Forever if we could)
Driving with my darling
Faster than I should
Driving with my darling
(Forever if we could)

Driving with my darling
Faster than I should
Driving with my darling
(Forever if we could)Embed
