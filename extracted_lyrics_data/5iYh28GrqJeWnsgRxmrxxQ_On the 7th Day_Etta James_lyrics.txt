1 ContributorOn The 7th Day LyricsNow I'm gonna tell you so you'll understand
How it all got started, how it all began
God made the heavens, God made the Earth
Made a man and a woman out of blood, sweat and dirt
And he looked around the neighborhood
And he said to himself "this is good"
God made the rivers and the mountains with his hands
God made the wind to blow the shifting sands
He put the fishes in the deep blue sea
Filled up the garden with flowers and the trees
And God looked around the neighborhood
And he said to himself "this is good"
But the devil, he was jealous, took the apple in his hand
The devil tempted woman and woman tempted man
God he mourned and the tears rolled down his face
It broke his heart to see his children fall from grace
And on the 7th day they say God rested but you know that ain't the truth
Cause on the 7th day, God made the blues
Cause on the 7th day, God made the blues
The Blues has been around ever since that day
Everybody gets the blues, everybody got to pay
For the wicked things we do and what we put each other through

Cause on the 7th day, God made the blues
Cause on the 7th day, God made the blues
God made the blues, yeahEmbed
