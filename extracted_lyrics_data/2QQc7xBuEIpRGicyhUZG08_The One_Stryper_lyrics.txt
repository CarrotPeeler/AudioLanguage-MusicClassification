2 ContributorsThe One LyricsI’ve blown up our world, and scattered pieces behind
A boy and innocent girl, defined one of a kind
Love was making, we were taking
But now it’s harder to find

You Still Move – oh You still move me yeah
You Will Always – You will always be The One
I say with a smile, all I should with a word
You’ve stayed for a while, it’s bordering on absurd
Cause that’s your glory and pains my story
But grace is what I’d prefer

You Still Move – oh You still move me
You Will Always – You will always be The OneYou might also likeEmbed
