Jeans, oh, I love you, you keep me warm
(Hey-hey-hey, hey)
Love, you give me content and form
(Hey-hey-hey, hey)
Oh, you feed me and keep me strong, strong
(Hey-hey-hey, hey)

I'll be all right
And I don't mind being sugared, 'cause

Oh, without my love
I'd be incomplete
And without my love
I'd be all empty
So, without my love
I would not be me

Friends, oh, I love you, you understand
(Hey-hey-hey, hey)
Thanks, you keep me as a good man
(Hey-hey-hey, hey)
Fans, you're lovely, you like our band
It's good
(Hey-hey-hey, hey)
You might also like
I'll be alright
And I don't mind being sugared, 'cause

Oh, without my love
I'd be incomplete
And without my love
I'd be all empty
So, without my love
I would not be me

We're alright
'Cause we don't mind being sugared, 'cause

Oh, without our love
We'd be incomplete
And without our love
We'd be all empty
So, without my love
I would not be meEmbed
