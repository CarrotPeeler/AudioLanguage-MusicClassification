Hands in others' pockets to fill their own
You know I’m pretty confused
Watching you
'Cause I’m pretty confused watching you
'Cause I’m pretty confused
I just stagger around
In god's zoo in god's zoo hey hey
Your filthy fingers
They are trying to scratch, she won't walk away from
'Cause I’m pretty confused watching you
'Cause I’m pretty confused
As I crawl around
In god's zoo in god's zoo hey hey
Right in the middle of
Right in the middle of This
I see a big bonfire It's getting higher
With you on the top
I can't wait to see fire
I can't wait to see you burning
I can't wait to see you burn
I can't wait to see you burning
Feel this winter of
Your discontentment
Spill your thoughts from your head
As we're dropping down
Like flies
Like flies
Like flies
Like flies
Like flies
Like flies
Like flies
Like flies flies flies flies
Flies flies flies flies flies
Flies flies flies flies hey hey
Flies flies flies flies flies fliesYou might also likeEmbed
