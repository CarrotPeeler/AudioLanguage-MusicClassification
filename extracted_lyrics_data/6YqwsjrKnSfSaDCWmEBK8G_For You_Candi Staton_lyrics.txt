1 ContributorThis One’s For You Lyrics
Girl, I don’t know what to do with you, (with you)
Every single time, we were friends, (hey)
Me and Ace Edition were singing, (to you)
Every girl, you were, on my mind, (girl)
Remember days Michael Jackson doing that Moonwalk at the 80s, (R.I.P Michael Jackson)
Girl, I watching that show called Saved By The Bell, (in the end of 80s)
I was playing video games with my online friends
Do you know that
I’m so handsome, yeah, (aye)
And this for you, girl

Girl, I know why, and why
I see you at the gas station
When you look at me
I will make you as a McFlurry
Right the time when you kiss me
And falling right in love with you
And also you told me that I look so handsome, baby

This One’s For You
And only you (your funky little thing)
All the funky little things you do
This one’s for you
Only you
And that’s why I didn’t take this jams to you
You might also like
Inspireration, (go ahead DS)
Every single girl straight look at me
And plus I see girls smile at me, (okay)
Cause you’re got a gorgeous teeth
Everybody dance on the floors
Your funky little thing, (funk thing)
I should give you a flowers to you, (Mr. Handsome CoolMan)
We should make out
I got yours love thing, baby
(Breakdown)
I’m not a good rapping
I’m tell you this though
When I wrote the song called A Girl Falling In Love With You
And that song is so amazing back in the days
I tell you this, Cause you’re got a beautiful face I should take you from outta space jam, (yessir)

Girl, I know why, and why
I see you at the gas station
When you look at me
I will make you as a McFlurry
Right the time when you kiss me
And falling right in love with you
And also you told me that I look so handsome, baby
This One’s For You
And only you (your funky little thing)
All the funky little things you do
This one’s for you
Only you
And that’s why I didn’t take this jams to you
