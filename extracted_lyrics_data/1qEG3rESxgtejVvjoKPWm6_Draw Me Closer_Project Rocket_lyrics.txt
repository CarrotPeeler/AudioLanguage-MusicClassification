3 ContributorsDraw Me Closer Lyrics
I've pictured you in paintings
I've painted you alive
And you draw me closer

I've pictured us in paintings
Let's go for a spill
So draw me closer
I've pictured us in paintings
So priceless when we die
And you draw me closer

Do you think with ink
Or have the colors in your mind all run dry
They've all run dry, all run dry
They've all run dry, all run dry
They've all run dry, all run dry

Well, did you get my postcard
I sent it years ago
Return to sender
Well, did you get my postcard
Or did you move away
Return to sender
You might also like
Do you think with ink
Or have the colors in your mind all run dry
They've all run dry, all run dry
They've all run dry, all run dry
They've all run dry, all run dry

I've pictured you in paintings
I've painted you alive
And you draw me closer
I've pictured us in paintings
Priceless when we die
Draw me closerEmbed
