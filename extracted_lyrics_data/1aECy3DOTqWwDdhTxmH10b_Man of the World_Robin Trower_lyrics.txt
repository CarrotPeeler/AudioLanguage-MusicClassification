2 ContributorsMan of the World LyricsI want to be, I got to be
I want to be, I got to be
I heard there was a future bride
Who will before your eyes
Oh, I guess I never knew
Yeah, what your woman's getting up to now
I want to be, I got to be
Man of the world
I want to be, I got to be
Man of the world
I want to be, I got to be
Man, man, man
I want to be, I got to be
I really tried to make ends meet
Keep your vow, turn off the streets
And I never wondered what you was feeling
All the time I was achieving and a stealing, yeah
I want to be, I got to be
Man of the world
I want to be, I got to be
Man of the world
I want to be, I got to be
Man of the world
I want to be, I got to be
And I tried to see the light
And I tried to turn back to fight
But all my friends that I was choosing, yeah
They were double dealers and a four-time losers, yeah
I want to be, I got to be
Man of the world
I want to be, I got to be
Man of the world
I want to be, I got to be
Man, man, man
I want to be, I got to be
Oh, yeah
I want to be, I got to be
Man of the world
I want to be, I got to be
Man of the world
I want to be, I got to be
