11 ContributorsThere I Said It Lyrics
You say you want the truth, but you can't take it
So I give you lies
I give you lies
You say you want the best, but you destroy it
So I keep it inside
I keep it inside

I'll tell ya something
It's a double-edged sword you're givin'
And I can't see the truth in livin'
When we hide behind a wall of fear
And you don't see it
It's a twisted dream you believe in
And what's the use in pretendin'?
Let's make the smoke and mirrors disappear

So there, I said it
And I won't apologize to you anymore
'Cause I'm a grown ass man
And I won't live again
And I'm sick and tired of livin' in your shadow
So there, I said it
No, I won't apologize to you anymore
'Cause I'm a grown ass man
And I don't understand
Why I should be livin' in the shadows
So there, I said it
You might also like
You wanna hear my voice, my mind, my demons
But not too much
Or you'll give up

I'll tell ya something
It's a double-edged sword you're givin'
And I can't see the truth in livin'
When we hide behind a wall of fear
And you don't see it
It's a twisted dream you believe in
And what's the use in pretendin'?
Let's make the smoke and mirrors disappear

So there, I said it
And I won't apologize to you anymore
'Cause I'm a grown ass man
And I won't live again
And I'm sick and tired of livin' in your shadow
So there, I said it
No, I won't apologize to you anymore
'Cause I'm a grown ass man
And I don't understand
Why I should be livin' in the shadows
So there, I said it2Embed
