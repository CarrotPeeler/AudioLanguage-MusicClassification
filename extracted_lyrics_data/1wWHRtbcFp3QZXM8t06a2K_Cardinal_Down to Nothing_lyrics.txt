3 ContributorsHow It Sets You Free Lyrics
Two birds, one stone
One shot, I've thrown
Both these wrongs don't make us right
And so it goes, I suppose, we sunk to this low tonight

They say the truth will set you free
Maybe, possibly

But not before it rips your chest out
And not before it puts your back against the wall
There's a painful coalition, a cardiac collision involved
That's how it sets you free

Two eyes shut tight
Two hands to block the light
Otherwise we just might see
And you and me will be forcibly set free

They say the truth will bring you to your knees
That might make me a better me
You might also like
But not before it rips your chеst out
And not before it puts your back against the wall
Thеre's a painful coalition, a cardiac collision involved
The truth might set you free
But first, it's gonna set fire to your house
It takes what you've been trusting, breaks it down to nothing at all
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Say hello to honest weather
Say goodbye to make-believe
We've been saved from our pretenses
By the skin of missing teeth
Eyes wide open here together
Maybe you and me could be
Uncomfortably, reluctantly
Inconveniently released

One bird, two wings
One you, one me
I don't know what I don't know
But all I know is I got no stones left to throw

What's the point of living comfortably
If what doesn't kill you sets you free?
But not before it rips your chest out
And not before it puts your back against the wall
There's a painful coalition, a cardiac collision involved
The truth might set you free
But first, it's gonna set fire to your house
It takes what you've been trusting, breaks it down to nothing at all
That's how it sets you free

Oh, that's how it sets you free
Oh, that's how it sets you free1Embed
