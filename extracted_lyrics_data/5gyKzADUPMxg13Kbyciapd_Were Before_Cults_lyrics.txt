I met you on the sidewalk
I hoped you were the way you were before
Don't give into the small talk
Don't give up on the things that we adore

Oh yes, you know I like that
I like it like the way we were before
Still got some things to work at
These days, just walking around here's such a chore

We both need it all the more
Just the way we were before
We both need it all the more
Just the way we were before

I'm pleased to see that old walk
Skipping all the cracks on the concrete
These days, you're walking real tall
Or tall as someone like you've ever seen

I've been around a few blocks
I chased away the cobwebs in the street
I wound up all the old clocks
So we can say we never skipped a beat
You might also like
We both need it all the more
Just the way we were before
We both need it all the more
Just the way we were before

'Cause we like that
Just like the way we were before
It's all mixed up
But that's just what we had in store

You can't fix that
You can't fix that
You can't fix that
You can't fix that2Embed
