10 ContributorsNew Beat Lyrics
Don't keep it all in your head
What we had was off
It's best that we forget
And overlook it all

But even now when they fall into place
I think about you then

I know I'd forget
If I was alone
Make sure I can miss
Love and hold on

Got left surrounded
By my old things
Thought I had moved on (thought I had moved on)
Tried to make ends meet
But picked up a new beat
And so I laid out (and so I laid out)

But even now when they fall into place
I think about 'em then
You might also like
I know I'd forget
If I was alone
Make sure I can miss
Love and hold on
Make sure I can miss
Love and hold on
Make sure I can miss
Love and hold on

Don't forget
Don't forget
Don't forget
Don't forget
Don't forget
Don't forget
Don't forget
Don't forget6Embed
