2 ContributorsNo Need to Worry LyricsWell it's hard to be lonely
Feeling everyone is down on you
It's hard to be lonely
Feeling everyone is down on you
And you find out later on
That they care so much for you
And you know it's hard to believe
The condition the world is in
Yeah it's hard to believe
The condition the world is in
Cause you get no way
You can't trust nobody
And every girl you know is insane
And no need to worry
One day things will come your way
And no need to worry
One day things will come your way
I heard that little baby say it so often
Where there's a will, there is a wayYou might also likeEmbed
