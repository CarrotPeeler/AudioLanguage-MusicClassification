4 ContributorsSweet Lady Luck LyricsYou hold all the aces
I never get the chance to deal
Flick of the wrist and you cut me down
I′m spinnin' like a roulette wheel
You say that love's a gamble
But you play with loaded dice
You hide behind a good girl smile
With a heart stone cold as ice
But I want it, I need it
If you don't give it, I'll steal it
I'll take it all, and walk away
Lady Luck
You're a loser in the game of love, Sweet Lady Luck
Who you gonna call when it all falls down on you?
Sweet Lady Luck
You can't stop your dealin'
'Cos it's a cryin' shame
When the winner takes it all
And never, ever takes the blame
But I want it, I need it
If you don′t give it, I'll steal it
I'll take it all, and walk away

You're a loser in the game of love, Sweet Lady Luck
Who you gonna call when it all falls down on you?
Ooh-ooh
What you gonna do?
Huh, what's that babe?
Lady Luck
I need your love, I need it now
I've got to have it anyhow
Sweet Lady Luck
I can′t win for losin'
It's tearin' me apart
So, I'll play the Joker to your queen of broken hearts
But I want it, I need it
If you don′t give it, I'll steal it
I'll take it all, and walk away
Lady Luck
You're a loser in the game of love, Sweet Lady Luck
Spinnin' like a roulette wheel, Sweet Lady Luck
You're a loser in the game of love, Sweet Lady Luck
I need your love, I need it now
I've got to have it anyhow
Sweet Lady Luck
Sweet Lady Luck
Sweet Lady Luck
