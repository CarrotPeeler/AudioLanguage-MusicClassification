1 ContributorStanding Strong LyricsSeems like all my life
I've been waiting for the day to come
When you'd turn to me and say just once
I've been wrong
But you threw your hat into the air
And caution to the wind
And whispered in my ear - ooh you said
Chorus:
I'll pick you up
And turn you round I'll leave you standing strong
On solid ground
To save you from these shifting sands
To join the earth right here where I stand
Cross my heart
Coz you know I knew it all along
I was waiting for the chance to show
I was strong
And o I can feel it in the air
That freedom's on the wind
It's whispering in my ear freedom says

They can keep on telling you
What's wrong and right
And spell it out in black and white
But don't you listen to a word they say
It doesn't matter anyway
You might also likeThey can keep on telling you
What's wrong and right
And spell it out in black and white
But don't you listen to a word they say
It doesn't matter anyway
