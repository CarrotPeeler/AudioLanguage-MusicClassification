3 ContributorsA Change Is Gonna Come LyricsI was born by the river in a little tent
Just like the river I been running ever since
It's been a long time coming
But I know, I know a change is gonna come
Oh yes, it is
It's been too hard living, I don't wanna die
I don't know what's up there beyond the skies
But it's been a long, long, long, long, long, long
Long
Time coming
But, people, let me tell you a change is gonna come, oh
Yes it is
Oh yes,it is, oh yes, it is, oh yes, it is
Then I go to my brothers
I say: "Brothers, help me, please"
But my brothers, they wind up knockin' me
Right down, down on my knees
There was times when I thought I wouldn't last long
Now I know I'm able to carry on
Been a long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long
Time coming
But people let me tell you a change is gonna come
Oh yes,it is, oh yes, it is, oh yes, it is
You might also likeThere's been laugh, there's been tears
There's been joy, there's been sorrow
Sometimes I thought there'd never be a tomorrow
It's been a long, long time coming
But I'm here to tell you a change is gonna come
Oh yes,it is, oh yes, it is, oh yes, it is
There's been wars, there's been fights
People are dying, nations are weaken
Sisters and brothers are crying
It's been a long, long, long, long
Long time coming
Oh, master, a change is got to come
Oh yes, it is
Then I go to my brothers
Brother, will you help me, help me
My brother winds up knocking me
Right down on my knees
I been so afraid of living
Too afraid of crying
There's been times I thought I was almost dying
Been a long, long, long, long, long, long
Time coming
But I know a change is gonna come
Oh yes, it has
Brother and sister
Neighbour and neighbour
Men against men
Boy against boy, girl against girl
Young and old been distroyed by their own hands
Problems and situations that parents cannot understand
Drugs and misused and abused and accused
War and war and bombs and war and more war
When
When will it come?
I wanna know, I wanna know, I wanna know
Why can't we give together?
Why can't we live together?
When will the change come?
It's coming, it's coming, co-co-c-coming, co-co-c-
Coming, co-co-c-coming
Change is gonna come, y'all
Oh yes, it is
England

Egypt

My brother, my mother
My sister, your brother
Change
When will it change, when will it?
And our minds and time and time and our minds
And my heart, will it ever be apart?
When we see, we believe
Can see it
A change is got to come
A change is got to comeEmbed
