2 ContributorsBlank Girl Lyrics
I remember when you used to hide behind your silly hair
It fell around your face so wildly but you didn't seem care
You always liked to play detective; Nancy Drew was your escape
Social skills perhaps defective; dressed up your own kind of way

You've become a new creation I don't want to miss out on
It's so sweet to see you make it on your own from duck to swan

Certain words you mispronounced cause you only let them form
Never spoke too many sounds, you're building up a quiet storm

You've become a new creation I don't want to miss out on
It's so sweet to see you make it on your own from duck to swan

Your first drink and your first straw
Your first kiss and your first love
Now you finally found your voice
 become my choice
You've become a new creation I don't want to miss out on
It's so sweet to see you make it on your own from duck to swanYou might also likeEmbed
