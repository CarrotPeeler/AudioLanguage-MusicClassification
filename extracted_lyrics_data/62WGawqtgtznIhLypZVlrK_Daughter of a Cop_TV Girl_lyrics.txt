Sneaking the pillow under the sheets
I know a place where everyone meets
But she knows a place
Where the cops don't go
And she'd be the one if anyone knows

If half the fun was to cut and run
And the other half was getting caught

Then don't stop (don't stop)
She was the daughter of a cop
Don't stop (don't stop)
The daughter of a cop

Making love is an easy thing to do
And she didn't feel like pushing herself
But don't be fooled
'Cause it could have been you
Or him or anyone else

If half the fun was to cut and run
And the other half was getting caught
You might also like
Then when the fix comes in
She'll get a slap on the wrist
And leave you in a cell to rot

So don't stop (don't stop)
She was the daughter of a cop
Don't stop (don't stop)
The daughter of a cop

Don't stop (don't stop)
The daughter of a cop2Embed
