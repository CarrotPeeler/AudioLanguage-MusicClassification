2 ContributorsIn The City Tonight LyricsI drove the road to the ledge
I walk down to the water's edge
Did you drown the part of me that's gone?
And when we wake up
Can you read the faded line?
I drove the road to the ledge
I walk down to the water's edge
Flows trough my blood like a renegade
(?) before you come again
Seen like a stone
So impassive you are
But i stood by your bloodied knife
I ran trough you, i felt it too

In the city tonight
I can hear it
I can see the lights
With wide open eyes
I'm so tired of this lie
In the city tonight
This is messed up
I keep everything to try
Tonight i've made up my mind
You might also likeShadows across me lie
I'm a stranger in every directions to completely, and they miss me
Shadows across me lie
Hailing the world in from me, feeling and breathing and reaching thowards (?)

In the city tonight
I can hear it
I can see the lights
With wide open eyes
I'm so tired of this spy
In the city tonight
This is messed up
Calculating why
Tonight i've made up my mindEmbed
