29 ContributorsRun & Hide Lyrics
Don't try to hide, you might as well embrace it
You've done it all, turn around and face it
The teachers say
The end will never come
But you can't decide, you're burying the seasons
The words are gone every time you're speaking
The kings return
Now where will you reside?

Run and hide, hide, hide, hide
Run and hide, hide, hide, hide
Run and hide
Sentimental rain drops, the tears fall in increments
Like incremental pain drops, that wash away the stained spots
The western world is just a hive of scum and villainy
That's why superheroes wear disguises in trilogies
When the future is uncertain, and the wizard's just a man
Inside the booth behind the curtain, behaving like a serpent
With a bag full of everything except your home
Just remember, be yourself and accept your own
Or run and hide
You might also like
Run and hide, hide, hide, hide
Run and hide, hide, hide, hide
Run and hide

Hide, hide, hide
The kings return (Hide)
Now where will you reside?

Run and hide, hide, hide, hide
Run and hide, hide, hide, hide
Run and hide3Embed
