7 ContributorsMove On Lyrics
Reflect in a mirror
Revenge is redundant
Resurrect your idols
Return to the basics
Realign your thoughts
Relocate to zero
Reverse into backwards
Repossess your soul

Now is the time
Reassess your values
Going back to the basics
To powerful needs
At the end of the day
It's an incredible 'sieg'
We are ready to rock
Get in the groove or die, or die, or die

My inner circle's helter-skelter
Echoes loving ecstasy
I know I'll find a way to live
A way for you and me
You might also like
Stuck in the past
With your blood-sucking sadness
Don't pretend understanding
Understand independence
We got to move on
Move on again
A generation of madness
Is growing again


Right on the edge of a nightmarish war
Roaming the land like never before

Saving yourself now
The trouble of having
The details of ending
Like in the past
Introducing the power
Of surviving the contest
Believe in your own strength
Now is the time
My inner circle's helter-skelter
Echoes loving ecstasy
I know I'll find a way to live
A way for you and me

Does it really matter what you believe?
Does it really matter if you belong?
Does it really matter what you believe?
Does it really matter if you belong?
Does it really matter what you believe?
Does it really matter what you believe?
Does it really matter if you belong?
Does it really matter if you belong?
Does it really matter what you believe?
Does it really matter what you believe?
Does it really matter if you belong?
Does it really matter if you belong?Embed
