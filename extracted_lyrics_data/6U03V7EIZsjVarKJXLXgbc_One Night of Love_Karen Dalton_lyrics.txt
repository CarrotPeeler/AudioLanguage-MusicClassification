2 ContributorsOne Night Of Love Lyrics
He gives me one night of love
Sometimes he gives me two
Mm, when I'm gone
He don't even think my name

It's got me down
Down to the ground
Looks like this whole world
And my best friend got me down
Mhm, mhm

I gave him all my money
All my good loving too
Oh, when I'm gone
He don't even mention my name

It's got me down
Down to the ground
Looks like this whole world
And my best friend got me down, it's got me down

I'm just singing this song
I wouldn't do anything wrong, it's got me down
I'm just telling the truth
I can't show you no kind of proof, it's got me down
You might also like
Got me down
Down to the ground
This whole world
And my best friend got me down, it's got me down

In one night of love
Gives me one night of love
One night of love
One night of love
One night of loveEmbed
