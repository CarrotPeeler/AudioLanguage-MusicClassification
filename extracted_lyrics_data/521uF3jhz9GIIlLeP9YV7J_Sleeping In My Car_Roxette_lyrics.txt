11 ContributorsSleeping in My Car Lyrics
I'll tell you what I've done, I'll tell you what I do
Been driving all night just to get close to you
(Baby, babe) I'm moving so fast
You'd better come on

The moon is alright, the freeway's heading south
My heart is going boom, there's a strange taste in my mouth
(Baby, babe) I'm moving real fast
So try to hold on
Yeah, try to hold on

Sleeping in my car, I will undress you
Sleeping in my car, I will caress you
Staying in the back seat of my car
Making up, oh-oh

So come out tonight (Come out tonight) I'll take you for a ride
This steamy ol' wagon, the radio is getting wild
Baby babe, we're moving so fast
I try to hang on
Oh, I try to hang on (Yeah)

Sleeping in my car, I will undress you
Sleeping in my car, I will caress you
Staying in the back seat of my car
Making love, oh yeah
Sleeping in my car, I will possess you
Sleeping in my car, certainly bless you
Laying in the back seat of my car
Making up, oh-oh

The night is so pretty and so young
The night is so pretty and so young
So very young, yeah


Sleeping in my car, I will undress you
Sleeping in my car, I will caress you
Staying in the back seat of my car
Making love to you
Sleeping in my car, I will possess you
Sleeping in my car, certainly bless you
Laying in the back seat of my car
Making up, making love
(Sleeping in my car) I will undress you
(Sleeping in my car)
The night is so pretty and so young
Yeah1Embed
