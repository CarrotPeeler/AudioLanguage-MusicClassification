There's something wrong here there can be no denyin'
One of us is changin' or maybe we've just stopped tryin'
And it's too late baby
Now it's too late
Tho' we really did try to make it
Somethin' inside has died
And I can't hide and I just can't fake it
It used to be so easy living with you
You were light and breezy and I knew just what to do
Now you look so unhappy and I feel like a fool
And it's too late baby
Now it's too late
Tho' we really did try to make it
Somethin' inside has died and I can't hide
And I just can't fake it
No, no, no
There'll be good times again for me and you
But we just can't stay together
Don't you feel it too?
Still I'm glad for what we had
And how I once loved you
You might also likeAnd it's too late baby
Now it's too late
Tho' we really did try to make it
Somethin' inside has died
And I can't hide and I just can't fake it
No, no, baby
It's too late
Now darlin', it's too late
Baby, it's too lateEmbed
