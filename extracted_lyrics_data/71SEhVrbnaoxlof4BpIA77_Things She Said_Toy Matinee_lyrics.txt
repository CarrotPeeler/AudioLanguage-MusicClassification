2 ContributorsThings She Said LyricsGray is not the color I expected
On someone who is often touched by grace
The eyes that hold the promise of perfection
Will find the flaw that no one can erase
And though she hears the rumors of intention
And many times I've failed to hide my stare
She will not breach a hint of indecision
She will not ever bend to show her care
Things she said
Every other daystore promise
Things she said would leave me wanting
Run to her, then run from other
Things she said
Broke me down and left me shattered
Hard as diamonds, it does not matter
Won't remember the things she said
Today I saw her face in all the papers
A smile to empty out a lion's cage
But notes that might remind her what that smile was for
Are scribbled on a long-forgotten page
Things she said
Every other daystore promise
Things she said would leave me wanting
Run to her, then run from other
Things she said
Broke me down and left me shattered
Hard as diamonds, it does not matter
Won't remember the things she said
You might also likeThe choice she never made
The face she never saved
The words she would not say
The lives she threw away
And the things she said
So gray is not the color I expected
On one who is so often touched by grace
But always she's the specter of uncertainty
I first endure, then pity, then embrace
Things she said
Every other daystore promise
Things she said would leave me wanting
Run to her, then run from other
Things she said
Broke me down and left me shattered
Hard as diamonds, it does not matter
Won't remember the things she said
Things she said
Every other daystore promise
Things she said would leave me wanting
Run to her, then run from other
Things she said
Broke me down and left me shattered
Hard as diamonds, it does not matter
Won't remember the things she saidEmbed
