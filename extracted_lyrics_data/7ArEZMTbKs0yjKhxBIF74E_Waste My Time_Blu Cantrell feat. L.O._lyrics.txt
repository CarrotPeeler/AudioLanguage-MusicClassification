2 ContributorsWaste My Time Lyrics
Yo, yo
It's , what's up?
Ah, ah ah, ah
Yo, blu up in here, what's up, one time
Ah, ah, ha
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Yo, turn me up

I gave you all my love
And it was never enough
You took for granted that I cared so very much (Much)
I gave you everything, I made your house a home
Please tell me why you did me wrong

Why do I waste my time on you?
Givin' you lovin' that you don't deserve
And if I had the chance to think it through
I probably wouldn't waste my time on you (Waste my time)
Why do I waste my time on you? (Whoa)
Givin' you lovin' that you don't deserve
And if I had the chance to think it through
I probably wouldn't waste my time on you
You might also like
I let you be a man
And still wanna front (Front)
I even cleaned your ash tray
When you rolled them up
But now you think somebody's love is as good as mine
I can't think of no reason
But boy, you must be blind

Why do I waste my time on you? (Why do I waste my time?)
Givin' you lovin' that you don't deserve
And if I had the chance to think it through
I probably wouldn't waste my time on you
Why do I waste my time on you?
(Waste my time, my time my time, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Givin' you lovin' that you don't deserve
And if I had the chance to think it through
I probably wouldn't waste my time on you
Why do I waste my time on you?
Givin' you lovin' that you don't deserve
And if I had the chance to think it through
I probably wouldn't waste my time on you
Why do I waste my time on you?
Givin' you lovin' that you don't deserve (Whoa)
And if I had the chance to think it through
I probably wouldn't waste my time on you
Now I've seen the light
It shines so bright
'Cause I know I'll find a man
Who will treat me right

(Call me baby, baby, oh, whoa)

Why do I waste my time on you?
(Why do I waste my time, my time?)
Givin' you lovin' that you don't deserve
And if I had the chance to think it through
I probably wouldn't waste my time on you
Why do I waste my time on you?
(Why do I waste my time on you, baby?)
Givin' you lovin' that you don't deserve
And if I had the chance to think it through (Baby, baby, oh)
I probably wouldn't waste my time on you

Play with it right now
Ah, what you all wanna do, Red Zone, 2000?
I get tired of all ya'll playin', what's up now?
Don't talk about 
Ya heard?Embed
