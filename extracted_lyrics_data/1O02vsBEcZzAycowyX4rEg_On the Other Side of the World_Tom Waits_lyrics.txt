3 ContributorsOn the Other Side of the World LyricsThere's a blue-eyed girl
With a red bow tie
And a string of pearls
With one good eye
In a rainy town
The chimney smoke will curl
No one likes clowns
On the other side of the world
And the children know
She'll never let me go
There's a one-legged priest
That tangos with the farmer's wife
Beauty and the beast
Is taking her own life
And a tear on a letter back home
Turns into a lake of your own
And a crow turns into a girl
On the other side of the world
And she tastes like the sea
And she's waiting for me
You might also likeIn the spring the weeds will show
He brought back the only rose
And he gave it to his girl
On the other side of the world
And I drink champagne
From your thin blue veins
She visits his grave
Wearing her mother's shawl
Should I shave
Or end it all?
There's an old sailor song
That the children know
As their fingers curl
'Round the other side of the world
On a bone white mare
Lost in Kathleen's hair
In the spring the weeds will show
He brought back the only rose
And he gave it to his girl
On the other side of the worldEmbed
