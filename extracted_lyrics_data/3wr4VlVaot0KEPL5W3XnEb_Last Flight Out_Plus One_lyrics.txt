3 ContributorsLast Flight Out LyricsI'm so scared that you will see
All the weakness inside of me
I'm so scared of letting go
That the pain I've hid will show
I know you want to hear me speak
But I'm afraid that if I start to
I'll never stop
I want you to know
You belong in my life
I love the hope I see in your eyes
For you I would fly
At least I would try
For you I'll take
The last flight out
I'm afraid that you will leave
As my secrets have been revealed
In my dreams you'll always stay
Every breathing moment from now
I know you want to hear me speak
But I'm afraid that if I start to
I'll never stop
You might also likeI want you to know
You belong in my life
I love the hope I see in your eyes
For you I would fly
At least I would try
For you I'll take
The last flight out
I cannot hold back the truth no more
I let you wait too long (wait too long)
Although it's hard and scares me so
A life without you scares me more
Scares me more
Scares me more
Scares me more
Oh... (na na na.. na na na na.. na na na na na..)
The last flight out...
For you I would fly (na na na.. na na na na.. na na na na na..)
At least I would try
For you I'll take
The last flight out
I want you to know you belong in my life (you belong in my life)
I love the hope I see in your eyes (I love the hope.. I see in your eyes, baby)
For you I would fly (for you I would fly)
At least I would try (at least I would try)
For you I'll take... (for you I would take)
The last flight outEmbed
