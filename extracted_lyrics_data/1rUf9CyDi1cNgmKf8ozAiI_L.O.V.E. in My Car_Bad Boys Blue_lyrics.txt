6 ContributorsL.O.V.E. in My Car LyricsWell, I'm burning, burning up the street
Watching people on their feet in my new car
No time, no time to mess around
Got my foot flat on the ground in my new car
I change the gears, I hear the wheel
We're riding smooth and inside the groove, uh huh
It's ten till eight, and it won't be late
So please be there don't hesitate, uh huh
I'll ride. Tonight
I'll hold you tight and make you mine
It's now or never girl
Outside. Start light
You'll be flying high by my side
L.O.V.E
Do you want to ride in my car?
I'm saying L.O.V.E
Do you want to get down in my car?
So if you want it, you got it, don't let it go
I'm saying L.O.V.E., L.O.V.E
So I step, I step down on the gas, we're moving super fast wild and free
Let me know is everything's alright?
We'll rock it through the night, you and me
Don't make me mad. Don't make me sad
Gonna put me down. Gonna wear a frown, uh huh
Let's groove all night, till the morning light
I'll play your music, you can't refuse it, uh huh
You might also likeI'll ride. Tonight
I'll hold you tight and make you mine
It's now or never girl
Outside. Start light
You'll be flying high by my side
L.O.V.E
Do you want to ride in my car?
I'm saying L.O.V.E
Do you want to get down in my car?
So if you want it, you got it, don't let it go
I'm saying L.O.V.E., L.O.V.E
(Accelerate, don't step on the brakes...)
L.O.V.E
Do you want to ride in my car?
I'm saying L.O.V.E
Do you want to get down in my car?
So if you want it, you got it, don't let it go
I'm saying L.O.V.E., L.O.V.EEmbed
