3 ContributorsSpellbound LyricsTunes of an enchanting song
Captured my attention at once
Stumbled in the waving grass
In the greenwoods
I was spellbound
So why no follow
Got nothing to risk
Got nothing to lose
Just go
With no expectations and no force
No negative thoughts
Follow the voice
Let's meet at the twilight
Let's run through the leaves
Till our hands bind again
Let's dance
Until sunrise
In the infatuated night
I'm bound by the wild
I'll climb up the fabled peak
Onto the view surrounds me
Sing out the melody
Of seduction that special night

The tunes
Our sensual moments
Never forget
The moves
Allure is everywhere
Magic's in the air
Let's meet at the twilight
I'm led astray by the charm
By your enthralling song
I'm spellbound
So why not follow
It's once in lifetime
And now just treasure the night
Until sunrise
Never erase
The tunes
Our sensual moments
Never forget
The moves
Allure is everywhere
Magic's in the air
So why no follow
Got nothing to risk
Got nothing to lose
Just go
With no expectations and no force
No negative thoughts
Follow the voice
Let's meet at the twilight
I'm led astray by the charm
By your enthralling song
I'm spellboundEmbed
