24 ContributorsPoppinâ€™ Lyrics
Say, say, say, s-say, say what your name is
Ooh, yeah, that fits you, girl
Tell me where you headed
Can I walk with you, girl?
You got that look in your eyes
That look like you give your boy here a good ol' time
And I'm on it, girl, that's right I'm on it, girl

See this is the first time I had a girl whose looks set me on fire
I'm really tryna get to know you better, girl, you ain't gotta act like you shy
'Cause we gon' do something, something is gon' get done
And we gon' get crunk and have a lot of fun and I say

Shawty, shawty
She wearing her hair, she working them jeans
She talking that talk just l-l-like I like it
She keep it on, man, poppin'
Shawty keep it on and poppin'
Ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah
Shawty, shawty
The way you wearing that top, got your boy so hot
Ain't no mistaking, playing, or faking
You got me open and waiting, and poppin'
You keep me on, man, poppin'
Ooh, ooh
