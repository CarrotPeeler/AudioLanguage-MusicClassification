There's a ring around the moon
I'm going to fly all night down to see you
I'm going to fly all night down to see you
There's a road drifting through the mountains
I'm gonna fly down that road
Until I get to where I'm going
Amen
There's a ring around the moon
I'm gonna fly all night down to see you
I'm gonna fly all night down to see you
There's a light inside my chest
That switched on when we first met
And it will not let me rest
Amen
There's a ring around the moon
I'm gonna fly all night down to see you
I'm gonna fly all night down to see you
And the silvery moon so fine
And the air tastes like wine
And the road slips and slides
Amen
There's a ring around the moon
I'm going to fly all night down to see you
I'm going to fly all night down to see you
There's a road slipping through the mountains
I'm gonna fly till I am there
I'll put a kiss behind your ear

There's a ring around the moon
I'm gonna fly all night down to see you
I'm gonna fly all night down to see you
There's a road drifting through the mountains
I'm gonna fly down that road
Until I get to where I'm going
AmenEmbed
