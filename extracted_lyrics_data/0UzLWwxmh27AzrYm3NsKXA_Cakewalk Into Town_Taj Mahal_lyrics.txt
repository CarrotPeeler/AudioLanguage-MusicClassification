You know I'm feeling so much better, I could cakewalk into town
Honey, I woke up this mornin' feelin' so good, you know I laid back down again
Throw your big leg over me mama, I might not feel this good again
My baby, my baby, I do love the way she walks
And when my woman gets sleepy, I love the way she baby-talks
My work is getting scarce, oh baby, my work it done got hard
I spend my whole day stealin' chickens, Honey, from the rich folks yard
I would love to take a picnic in the country and stay all day
I wouldn't do nothing but while my blues away
I had the blues so bad one time it put my face in a permanent frown
You know I'm feelin' so much better I could cakewalk into townYou might also likeEmbed
