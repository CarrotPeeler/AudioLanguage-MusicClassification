18 ContributorsMean LyricsBorn a cop in uniform
In black vinyl gloves
I don't hate you for your steel-toed boots
Or your handcuffs
You are the way you always were
You like your cruel games
But I am not so quick to break
I count my gain in blood and pain
I like it when it hurts like hell
There's nothing you could do to me
I wouldn't do to myself
I'll be bound to you in leather and chains
I'll be your sister, your young bride
Your angel, your slave
Born a cop in uniform
In black vinyl gloves
I don't hate you for your steel-toed boots
Or your handcuffs
You are the way you always were
You like your cruel games
But I am not so quick to break
I count my gain in blood and pain
I like it when it hurts like hell
There's nothing you could do to me
I wouldn't do to myself
I'll be bound to you in leather and chains
I'll be your sister, your young bride
Your angel, your slaveYou might also like3Embed
