1 ContributorWhere That Loveâ€™s Been Gone Lyrics
Sometimes I wonder who's making love to you now
Now that it's been so long
Well, sometimes I wonder who's making love to you now
Now that it's been so long
Well, I don't know how or where or when you found out
Where that love's been gone

Remember that winter we went walking in the snow?
Now it's been and gone
Yes, I remember the winter we went walking in the snow
Snow that's been and gone
And right across the country, still I've got to go
Wherever that love's been gone

But any old way, there's a smile on my face
There's a smile that I just can't hide
Though I'm missing you now like I never knew how
I couldn't forget you if I tried

Don't it make you wonder, but I wouldn't worry no more
Standing by the side of the road
Oh, don't it make you wonder, but I wouldn't worry no more
Just standing by the side of the road
Into the night, you just pick up and go
You'll see where the love's been gone
You might also like
But any old way, there's a smile on my face
There's a smile that I just couldn't hide
Though I'm missing you now like I never knew how
I couldn't forget you if I tried

I couldn't forget you, I couldn't forget you
I couldn't forget you if I tried
I couldn't forget you, I couldn't forget you
I couldn't forget you if I triedEmbed
