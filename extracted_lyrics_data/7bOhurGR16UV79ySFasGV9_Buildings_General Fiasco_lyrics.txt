Crawling back only to see you are getting along without me
So cut me out so it will be I just need I just need I just need
Little words what should I say
Terror holding me holding me
Ever wanting to be with you knowing no one will feel like you do
Pick me up struggle at hand I don't want to but I understand
Watch me now I walk away I'm getting good wouldn't you say
So cut me out so it will be I'm just having some trouble you see
Little thoughts carry me down
Terror holding me holding me
Ever wanting to be with you knowing no one will feel like you do
Terror holding me holding me
Ever wanting to be with you knowing no one will feel like you doYou might also likeEmbed
