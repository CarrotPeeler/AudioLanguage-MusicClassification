1 ContributorNever Thought LyricsI was excited 
To see you again
I never thought
We'd ever end
I used to be your one
And now just a friend 
I know that your kiss
Could help me mend
From your tenderness 
I still depend
There's no need
To defend
I'll be careful 
Not to offend
And you won't see
When I pretend 
I never thought
We could endYou might also likeEmbed
