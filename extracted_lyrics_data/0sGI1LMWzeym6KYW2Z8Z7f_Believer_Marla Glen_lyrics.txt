We are out to find
Like a believer
We are living our minds
Like a believer
We don't waste any time
Like a believer
We stand our ground
I just can't understand this
Why it's so hard
To take each other by the hand and
And say that I love you
Like a believer
We can't let this go
No more war
No more war no more war
Just say that I love you
This world is in trouble
We got to find a way
To come together
And make a better way
I can't understand this
No

There's no time for children
And their hearts
Just look at their eyes
Can't you see you're tearing
Them apart
So I ask you believe us
Don't waste any time
Let's stay together and
Save our world
I just can't understand this
Why it's so hard
To take each other by the hand and
And say that I love you
Like a believer
We can't let this go
No more war
No more war no more war
Just say that I love you
I just can't understand this
