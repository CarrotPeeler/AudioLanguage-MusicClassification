5 ContributorsPainful Detour LyricsTime elapsing
Storm running out
Sorrow less beauty
Ready to doubt
Stronger than ever
Weak at the bone
Hide from the open
Turn into stone
Underneath a freezing winter
All alone
Superficial friendly gesture
Dead and gone
Spend my days searching places
To belong
Stranded in a painful detour
What went wrong?
Massive agenda
Shivering ground
Building a castle
Foundation unsound
Never suspected this beauty to be
Carving deeply into my stone
Gathering round me, yet feelings dilate
A new dimension of feeling alone

Complexity near
Not what it seems like
Covered in fear
Underneath a freezing winter
All alone
Superficial friendly gesture
Dead and gone
Spend my days searching places
To belong
Stranded in a painful detour
What went wrong?1Embed
