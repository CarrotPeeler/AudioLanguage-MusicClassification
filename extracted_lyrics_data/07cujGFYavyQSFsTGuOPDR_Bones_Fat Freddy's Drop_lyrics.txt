3 ContributorsBones LyricsGet them bones in the water, uh
Leave them all day
Get them bones in the water, uh
Leave them all day
Get them bones in the water, uh
Leave them all day
Get them bones in the water, uh
Leave them all day
Good things take time to do, now
So I'ma take my time with you
Down here when we make it over
The road is long, it makes you stronger
Life is such a mystery
Still wonder who I might see
Steamy windows, rainy days
The best has yet to come my way
Heat, feel so good to me
Can't get enough of them bones babe
Bones baby, baby
Heat it up baby
Heat it up baby
Heat it up baby
Take me over the cloudy rains
The world of peaceful borders, babe
The road is long, the nights are dark
Get a little closer every day

Get them bones in the water, uh
Leave them all day
Get them bones in the water, uh

Like it was only yesterday
I remember all the things you told me
Don't take what you got for granted
Give some to receive
I made a, weak won for whiskey bottle
Still keepin my powder dry
Still got no alibi, some things that you've done for me
Paid for who I am, it's hard work that makes the man
Keepin on, you know I can
Keepin on, you know I can
Keepin on, you know I can
Keepin on, you know I can
You know I'm
You know I'm
You know I'm
You know I'm
Not gonna let this thing bring me down
It's cold outside but there's a woman in your arms
Not gonna let this thing bring me down, no
Won't bring me down
Won't bring me down
You won't bring me down
Oh, no baby, you won't bring me down
Oh, no baby, you won't bring me down
Oh, no baby, you won't bring me downEmbed
