1 ContributorRight to Rape LyricsWhat kind of world is this that we're living in
When a man accused guilty of rape
Is still freed from the charges miraculously
If he confesses that he's made a mistake
Is a woman supposed to just spread both her legs
And let the sexual ritual proceed
If she doesn't say no do you have her permission
To treat her any which way you please
Does the fact that she's wasted somehow make it accepted
That she can't tell what's right from what's wrong
And are the clothes that she's wearing an obvious signal
That the rape is allowed to go on
You take it for granted cause' you've got the advantage
It's a logic that I find hard to follow
It still doesn't mean that the decision is yours
And I find your excuse hard to swallow
He clears his name, & she get's all the blame
If a woman raped a man, would the verdict be the same?
He clears his name, & she get's all the blame
If a woman raped a man, would the verdict be the same?
(Be the same!)
You might also likeTell me what were you thinking, if you even were
When you forced her to go all the way
Did you feel like a big man when you were on top of her?
Did you make that bitch pay?
You're not a man, you're the scum of the earth
You had the whole thing planned from the start
And you've got the guts to say you feel like a victim
There's not a soft spot in your heart
He clears his name, & she get's all the blame
If a woman raped a man, would the verdict be the same?
He clears his name, & she get's all the blame
If a woman raped a man, would the verdict be the same?
(Be the same!)
You make it seem as if she should have seen it coming
As if that was a valid excuse
Whatever you say you still know what you've done
And nothing justifies the abuse
It takes two too tango so don't you try and tell us
That you were sure that you heard her say yes
We don't believe you it's your cock doing the talking
So why don't you just fucking confess?
He clears his name, & she get's all the blame
If a woman raped a man, would the verdict be the same?
He clears his name, & she get's all the blame
If a woman raped a man, would the verdict be the same?
(Be the same!)Embed
