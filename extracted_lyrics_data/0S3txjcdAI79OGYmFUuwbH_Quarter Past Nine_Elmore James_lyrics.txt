1 ContributorQuarter Past Nine LyricsI've got a baby, I don't know where she is
Yes, I've got a baby, but I don't know where she is
I'll get in my bed and sleep better
Can't keep my poor self still
Oh, tell me baby, what you got on your mind
Ah, please tell me baby, what you got on your mind
Oh, I got to see you baby, you know I can't lose my time
The clock here this morning say a quarter past nine
I was sitting and rocking in the morning baby
Until a quarter past nine
Well, when I find my other baby
You know you done lost your timeYou might also likeEmbed
