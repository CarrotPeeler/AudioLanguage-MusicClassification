Bom, bom, bom
Bom, bom, bom
Bom, bom, bom
If you cry, I think my heart would break
That would be much more than I could take
And if I saw a tear fall from your eye
Darling, don't you know that I would die
True love
True love
True love
True love
Bom, bom, bom
Bom, bom, bom
Bom, bom, bom
Bom, bom, bom
If you cry, I don't know what I'll do
Baby, 'cause I'm so in love with you
And if I knew that I had caused you pain
My tears would fall like the rain
True love
True love
True love
True love
