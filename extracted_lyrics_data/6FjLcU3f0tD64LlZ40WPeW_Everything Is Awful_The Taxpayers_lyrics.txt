4 ContributorsEverything is Awful LyricsSame damn time
Same fucking place
Everything around here is awful
Something isn't right here
But I can't put my finger on it
Same damn time
Same fucking place
Everything around here is awful
Something isn't right here
But I can't put my finger on it
Pull yourself right up
With your own two hands
I hope that you can
Same damn time
Same fucking place
Same damn time
Same fucking place
By the time everyone's arrived
The burners are off and the dishes are done
The lights are turned off and the residents are drunk
Passed out in the kitchen while the refrigerator hums
And even the dogs are asleepYou might also likeEmbed
