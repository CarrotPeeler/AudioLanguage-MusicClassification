1 ContributorLouisiana Blues LyricsI'm goin' to Louisiana, baby, behind the sun
I'm goin' to Louisiana, baby, behind the sun
I just found out my trouble's just begun
I'm goin' to New Orleans, get me a mojo hand
I'm goin' to New Orleans, get me a mojo hand
Goin' to show all you women, show how to treat your man
Oh yea
{John Popper Harp Solo - Rod - Slide Solo}
Uh huh huh huh huh uh huh huh huh huh huh
If the river was whiskey, I was a diving duck
If the river was whiskey, I was a diving duck
I'd swim to the bottom, drink myself back up
I'd swim to the bottom, drink myself back up
