My lovin' babe, I'm all out and down
Lovin' babe, I'm all out and down
Lovin' babe, I'm all out and down
I'm laying close to the ground

Look where that evening sun has gone
Look where the evening sun has gone
Look where that evening sun done gone
Gone, God knows where

It was the longest day that ever I seen
It was the longest day that ever I seen
The longest day that ever I seen
The day Roberta died

Just make me onе pallet on your floor
Just make me onе pallet on your floor
I'll make me a pallet on your floor
Make it so your husband never knows

That eastbound train come and gone
That eastbound train come and gone
That eastbound train come and gone
Gone to come no more

Got the blues, God, I'm feelin' bad
Yeah, I got the worried blues, feelin' bad
I got the blues, feeling bad
Feelin' bad, got no one

Babe, I'm all out and down
Lovin' babe, I'm all out and down
Lovin' babe, I'm all out and down
I'm layin' to the ground

Pink rosy sun come and gone
Now the eastbound sun's come and gone
Yeah, the eastbound sun's come and gone
Lord, babe, I'm all out and down

Bluebird of peace gone away
Yeah, the red bird gone away
Yeah, the red bird, they gone away
She gone to come more

 me down on your floor
Yeah,  me down on your floor
Yeah,  me down on your floor
 me so your man never know
Ooh, what have I done?
Lovin' babe, what have I done?
Lovin' babe, what have I done?
Honey baby, you treat me wrong

I'm goin' to come no more
Yes, I'm goin' away to come no more
I'm goin' away to come no more
Baby, put one on your floorEmbed
