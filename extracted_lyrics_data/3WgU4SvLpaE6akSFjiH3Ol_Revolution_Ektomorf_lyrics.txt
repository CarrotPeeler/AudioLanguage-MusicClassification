Break the walls, break the chains
Let the fire burn all the fakes
No control, no more lies
Now is the time to free our lives
Our life is the fight
Our fist in the sky
Nothing can stop us; we got the power
Yeah, we got the power

Wasted time, no believe
Hold us down; this shit we don't need
Go ahead, don't look back
Live for tomorrow, fuck the past
We take no more; we bring this war
We had enough; we destroy them all
Nothing can stop us; we got the power
Yeah, we got the power
Bring the fire to burn
Bring the fire to burn it all
Bring the fire to burn
Bring the fire to burn it all
Bring the fire to burn
Bring the fire to burn it all
Bring the fire to burn
Bring the fire to burn it all
