11 ContributorsTill I Lost Lyrics
A coffee stain on a window sill
A bad translation to a foreign film
Just wandering 'round with you, you know
Just wandering town with you
Oh-oh-oh-oh, would be enough

The tiny cracks on the city stone
A welcome back to your troubled home

Just wandering 'round with you
Just wandering town with you, you know
Oh-oh-oh-oh, would be enough

But, oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I didn't see the sea until I crossed
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I didn't feel your love until I lost

The moving shadows on your swaying light
Or your picture notes of your porcupines

Just wandering 'round with you, you know
Just walking these towns with you
Oh-oh-oh-oh, would be enough

But, oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I didn't see the sea until I crossed
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I didn't feel your love until I lost
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I didn't see the sea until I crossed
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
And I didn't feel your love until I lost

Oh-oh-oh!8Embed
