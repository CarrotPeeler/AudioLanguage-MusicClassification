He's my baby and he thrills me so
Every morning 'fore the sun comes up
He brings me coffee in my favorite cup
That's how I know, yes I know
Hallelujah, I just love him so
When I'm in trouble and I have no friends
I know he'll be with me until the end
Everybody asks me how I know
I smile at them and say he told me so
That's how I know, yes I know
Hallelujah, I just love him so
And when I call him on the telephone
Tell him that I'm all alone
By the time I count from one to four
I hear him, on my door
In the evening when the sun goes down
And there ain't nobody else around
He kisses me and then he holds me tight
He tells me honey, everything's alright
That's how I know, Lord I know
Hallelujah, I just love him so

Tell him that I'm all alone
By the time I count from one to four
I hear him, on my door
In the evening when the sun goes down
And there ain't nobody else around
He kisses me and then holds me tight
And he tells me honey everything's alright
That's how I know, Lord I know
Hallelujah, I just love him so
Hallelujah, I just love him so
Hallelujah, I just love him so
Hallelujah, I just love him so
Hallelujah I love him soEmbed
