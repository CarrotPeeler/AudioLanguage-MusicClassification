I still love you just like I did before
But, before you smile and walk through the door

I don't wanna cry
I don't wanna cry
No more, no darling, no more

You come and go just like the morning sun
I was so serious but, you were having fun

But, I don't wanna cry
I don't wanna cry
No more, no darling, no more

Welcome to my lips
Welcome to my arms
Oh, you are welcome to my, my heart
Girl, you are welcome to every little thing I have to offer you
So, come on and take it, take it apart
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Mama, hunh
Oh, I know I was wrong, yes I was
Oh, but, I need to come back home
Yeah
Baby, baby, baby

I don't wanna cry
I don't wanna cry
No more, no darling, no more
Yeah

Come on in
Walk on in
Come on now baby
Walk right on in, yeah
The door's wide open
So, walk right on in
Yeah, bring it on home, yeah
Walk right on inEmbed
