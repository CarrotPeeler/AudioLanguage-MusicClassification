(Inhales sharply)
And even though, the flowers bloom
(And even though the flowers bloo-oom)
And even though, the flowers bloom
(And even though the flowers bloom)
When I come down
From these flowers
(These flowers got me on some other)
Some other, way out
Way-ay-ay-ay out
Way-ay-ay-ay out, out

And even though, the flowers bloom
And even though the flowers--- (Tch!)
When I come down
These words for you
These words for you
And even though, the flowers bloom
(And even though the flowers bloo-oom)
When I come down
These words for you
These words for you (You!)

Who says
That we got plenty of time to just, kick it?
Why do we kick it?
I kick it too
He kicks it too
We all kick it too
Why do we kick it?
Who says, who says that, one day
Time will be gone?
Time will be gone
Why do we kick it?
(Kick it, kick it)
(Why, why, why do we kick it?)
You might also like
And even though, the flowers bloom
(And even though the flowers bloo-oo-oom)
When I come down
These words for you
(For you, for you)Embed
