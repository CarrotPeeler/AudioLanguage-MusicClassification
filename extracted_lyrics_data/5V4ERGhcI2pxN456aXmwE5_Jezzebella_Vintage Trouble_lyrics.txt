Moving their mouths about you
But they don’t know that what they’re throwing out
Is what I’m looking for
While the other brothers stay inside
I’ll meet you outside
Outside of the line
JEZEBELLA
I KNOW I’M THE FELLA
TO GIVE YOU A RUN FOR YOUR MONEY
JEZEBELLA
I KNOW I’M THE FELLA
TO SPILL THE MILK ON YOUR HONEY
A RUN FOR YOUR MONEY
JEZABELLA
Everybody’s spinning words around
Moving their mouths about you
But they don’t know that what they’re throwing out
Is what I’m looking for
Shake it baby break it down for me
Turn it out teach me something
Groove it to it let me feel and see
What you’re made of
You might also likeAnybody who done passed you by
Must be out of their minds
But that’s alright
JEZEBELLA
I KNOW I’M THE FELLA
TO GIVE YOU A RUN FOR YOUR MONEY
JEZEBELLA
I KNOW I’M THE FELLA
TO SPILL THE MILK ON YOUR HONEY
A RUN FOR YOUR MONEY
JEZABELLA
Whenever I see you
I want to be in you for life
So whatever you say is okay
Whatever you do I’ll do too
You are fine, fine as with meEmbed
