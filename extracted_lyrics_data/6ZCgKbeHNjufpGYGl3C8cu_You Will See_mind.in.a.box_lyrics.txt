1 ContributorYou Will See LyricsWhen I first met you, I ruled the world
What you saw, met with your desire
When I first saw you, I ruled the sky
What you felt, set your heart on fire
When I first held you, I thought I'd pass
What you said, seemed to be the truth
When I first felt you, I thought I'd melt
What you were, was the essence of youth
I felt the warmth
Filtering through your skin
I had all that I could ask for
And I thought it to last
I was so sure of your affection
And I loved the spell you cast
I was scaling incredible heights
Propelled by your radiant muse
I sustained this for a long time
But I was destined to lose
I had all that I could ask for
And I thought it to last
I was so sure of your affection
And I loved the spell you cast
I was basking in all that glory
Thought the end cannot be nigh
I made plans for our future
Humbled only by the sky
You might also likeYou will see, I can get back there
When all was doubt, you laughed at me
Ripped me apart
There's no future for you and me
You will see, I can climb up there
When you lost faith, you turned your back
Destroyed my trust
There's no future for you and me
You will see, I won't forgive this
When you rethink, you won't be heard
Words don't heal
There's no future for you and me
You will see, I will survive this
When I had need, you were not there
It's too late
There's no future for you and meEmbed
