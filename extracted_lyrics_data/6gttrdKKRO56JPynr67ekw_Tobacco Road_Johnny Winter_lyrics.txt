Mama died and my daddy got drunk
Left me here to die alone
In the middle of tobacco road
Growin' up lord in a rusty shack
And all I had was hangin' on my back
Lord knows how I loathe
This place called Tobacco Road
But it's home
The only life, life, life I've ever known
And I guess I can't help but
Loathe Tobacco
(Instrumental)
Gonna leave, and get a job
With the help and the grace from above
I'll save my money, get rich and old
And I think I'll bring it all back to Tobacco Road
Bring dynamite and a big old crane
And I'll blow it up, start all over again
I'm gonna build me a town, that Ill be proud to show
And I think I'll give it the name Tobacco Road
You might also likeBut it's home
The only life I've ever known
I guess I can't help but love you
'Cause you're home
Tobacco Road
Tobacco Road
Whoah, Tobacco Road
Bring dynamite and a big old crane
I'll blow it up, tear it down and start all over again
I guess I can't help but I love...
I love you...
Yeah...
Tobacco...!
(Instrumental and vocalizing)
I love you!
Oh I love you!
Oh I love you!
I love you!
I love you!

(Vocalizing)
I love you 'cause you're home
I'm talkin' 'bout Tobacco Road, yeah
Tobacco Road, yeah!Embed
