1 ContributorEveryone I See LyricsThere's a day I see ahead
There's more room than a fork in the road
And I took the same thing
And I feel so far from home
There's a life I see ahead
There's more than a fork in the road
Self-instruction theory of exactly what to do
Everyone I see is you
Everyone I see is you
My minds been playing tricks on me
I stumble over something strange
You make me want to want you more
And I took the same thing
I feel so far from home
There's a life I see ahead
There's more than a fork in the road
Self instruction theory of exactly what to do
Everyone I see is you
Everyone I see is you
Everyone I see is you
My minds been playing tricks on me
I stumble over something
You make me want you more
I can't wait, but I willYou might also likeEmbed
