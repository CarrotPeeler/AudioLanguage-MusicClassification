So cold and lonely it seems so long since someone was here
Following the shadows, with the sun till it disappears
Thousands of stone white crosses, a formation for all to see
With flags and flames, the ranks and the names of those who died to be free

The fire remains in our hearts
All of our dreams made new
Etched in the flames of freedom
We're living on through you

We're the shadow soldiers
Laid to rest standing tall
Shadow soldiers
In freedom, you live
That's why we've given it all

Taken too soon from the lives we loved a misery I can not explain
Only when we feel your presence are we sure we did not die in vain

The fire remains in our hearts
All of our dreams made new
Etched in the flames of freedom
Are these words, oh so true
We're living on through you

Laid to rest standing tall
Shadow soldiers
In freedom, you live
That's why we've given it all


The fire remains in our hearts
All of our dreams made new
Etched in the flames of freedom
We're living on through you

We're the shadow soldiers
Laid to rest standing tall
Shadow soldiers
In freedom, you live
That's why we've given it all

Shadow soldiers
Laid to rest standing tall
Shadow soldiers
In freedom, you live
That's why we've given it allEmbed
