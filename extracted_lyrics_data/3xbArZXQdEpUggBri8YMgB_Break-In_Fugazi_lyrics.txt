10 ContributorsBreak-In Lyrics
And he's happy because she's got skin
And she's happy just to let him in
When he asks her will you let me in?
And from a place where they share skin, they say

Come inside
Come inside
Come inside

And he's happy because she's got skin
And it's sweet because there ain't no sin
But there's a time when the skin wears thin
Now she's working on another skin

Deep inside
Deep inside
Deep inside
Deep inside

And he wonders will my money, will it cover for me
And he wonders will my money, will it cover for me
Can I stay outside and let it cover for me?

Break-in
Break-in

And he wonders will my money, will it cover for me
And he wonders will my money, will it cover for me
Can I stay outside and let it cover for me?
She can't get outside
She can't get outside
She's the coveringEmbed
