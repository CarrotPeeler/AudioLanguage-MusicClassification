3 ContributorsThe Sky is a Gypsy LyricsThe first time was the best time
The language you use
You gotta be careful what you will choose
And the first high was the best high
You're made of flesh and blood
Yet it makes you feel like wood
Oh the first time was the best time
The first line was the best line
It's hard to learn to beware
Spending thousands of pounds in a year
And worthwhile, is it worthwhile?
Ever wondered why you need more and more
To reach that sky?
Oh the first time was the worst time
And the sky is a gypsy
Oh, will I die with her with me?
Oh the best time is the worst crime
Oh the first time, oh may be the worst time
Oh, worthwhile, is it really worthwhile?
When the sky is a gypsy
Oh, will I die with her with me?

Will I die with her with me?
Oh no, no, no, no
The first time
Maybe the worst time
Oh no...
Will I die with her with me?Embed
