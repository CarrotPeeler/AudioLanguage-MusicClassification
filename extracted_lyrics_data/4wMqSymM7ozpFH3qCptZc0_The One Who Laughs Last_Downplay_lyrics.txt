10 ContributorsThe One Who Laughs Last Lyrics
There's a war inside of me
And you watch it silently
Any idiot could see
That I killed all the hope that I had
There's a war inside of me
Burning red and honestly
And I wave it constantly
Like a flag, like a flag, like a flag

This knife that's in my back
Keeps twisting
Anxiety attacks

This is a battleground
I'm caught in the crossfire
My words are weaponry
And I'm waiting patiently
You win the battle now
But I will return the fire
'Cause I'd crawl on broken glass
To be the one who laughs last

You're advancing mercilessly
Unprovoked and needlessly
And I'll march you into the sea
Just to watch you drown in the end
I am used to these black eyes
To be bruised, antagonized
But it overwhelms my mind
To believe that I called you a friend
You might also like
This knife that's in my back
Keeps twisting
Anxiety attacks

This is a battleground
I'm caught in the crossfire
My words are weaponry
And I'm waiting patiently
You win the battle now
But I will return the fire
'Cause I'd crawl on broken glass
To be the one
This is a battleground
I'm caught in the crossfire
My words are weaponry
And I'm waiting patiently
You win the battle now
But I will return the fire
I'd crawl on broken glass
To be the one who laughs last

And down the trenches I will go
Fight the armies on my own
I alone
This is a battleground
I'm caught in the crossfire
My words are weaponry
And I'm waiting patiently
You win the battle now
But I will return the fire
'Cause I'd crawl on broken glass
To be the one
This is a battleground
I'm caught in the crossfire
My words are weaponry
And I'm waiting patiently
You win the battle now
But I will return the fire
I'd crawl on broken glass
To be the one who laughs last
To be the one who laughs last5Embed
