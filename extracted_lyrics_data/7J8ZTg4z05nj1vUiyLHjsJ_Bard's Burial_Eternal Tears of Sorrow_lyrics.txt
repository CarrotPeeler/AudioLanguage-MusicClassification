2 ContributorsBardâ€™s Burial LyricsHere we are at bard's burial
To celebrate our friend's
Last journey to Walhalla
Come my friend, drink this wine
Eat all food and sing all night
Last breath, final verse
A poem you have never heard
End of life, shining bright
Goodbye, we sing your songYou might also likeEmbed
