5 ContributorsPurify Lyrics
Spatial awareness
So much confusion
And it's so difficult to harness
But then, I look at you
Nimble and righteous
And then, I look at the floor
We made a fine mess

My kiss
Can you feel it yet?
In the back of your legs
And on the nape of your neck

Are you a temple?
Are you a temptress?
There's too much choice
The possibilities are endless
So, wash away my sins
Give me catharsis
Remagnetize
My moral compass

My kiss
Can you feel it yet?
In the back of your legs
And on the nape of your neck
Your touch
I cannot regret
I love the shape of your mouth
And the back of your head
You might also like
You are so my kind
Erotic and divine
I gotta testify
To how you purify

To me, you're more than a human
(To me, you're more than a human)
You are more complex
(You are more complex)
You're like a fallen angel
(You're like a fallen angel)
Who uses God as a hex

My kiss
Can you feel it yet?
In the back of your legs
And on the nape of your neck
Your touch
I cannot regret
I love the shape of your mouth
And the back of your head

You are so my kind
Erotic and divine
I gotta testify
To how you purify1Embed
