2 ContributorsSparklyemeralds Will Retire LyricsLego Star Wars, skip 2 years, Herobrine, bad for ears
He strikes again, part two when, really not good audio
Body shaming(?), shaky vison, out to nature, bad decision
Bad idea, wait do I hear a-, “SONY IS STUPID”
(instrumental break)
Really bad prank, milestone, ezvid, dad’s monotone
Cookie clicker, this is a lie, and this tutorial- OMG MY-
Stolen memes, stolen vids, this is just high pitched screams
New intros, logic stops, rhyme time, Roblox
Sparklyemeralds will retire
He stopped uploading, since the world's been dying (2020)
Sparklyemeralds will rеtire
He has after еffects, but doesn’t finish projects
TYC, simulation, Nasa and defecation
Beta tik tok, glitchy sin count, into cold shock
Roblox, Epic Fortnite, This a pirate?, Flashing Light
Little more Roblox, covering pewd’s arc
B-series, PETA strike, Devin’s got a yeti mic
Dissing toad, can’t rhyme, licking gfuel, That’s a crime
Next post, Elbow reveal, Caterpiller, hater spoiler
Really crap, what a simp, next few is better than that

No, he used to edit, now he has no credit
No title, where’s the mask, Scrolling reddit, just don’t ask
Corrupt file, editor, editing got a change of style
Got demoted, Roblox rapping, fine,  there he showed it
Braincell homicide, mental health disqualified
Toad quits, small breaks, true potential awakes
Nevermind, back to Cancer, Don’t be a dancer
Break again, hacked by an enemy, He’ll upload eventually…
Cooking remake, oh no, talking to the chatto
Sparklyemeralds will retire
He stopped uploading, now he’s gone to streaming

Now leave a comment, that he should make more content

Sparkly might be gone, but we’ll wait on

When will you upload, like seriously dude2Embed
