9 ContributorsI Need Your Love Tonight Lyrics
Oh oh-oh, I love you so
Uh uh, I can't let you go
Ooh ooh, don't tell me no
I need your love tonight

Oh gee, the way you kiss
Sweetie, too good to miss
Wow-whee, want more of this
I need your love tonight

I've been waiting just for tonight
To do some lovin' and hold you tight
Don't tell me, baby, you gotta go
I got the hi-fi high and the lights down low

Hey now, hear what I say
Ooh wow, you better stay
Pow pow, don't run away
I need your love tonight
Yeah!
I need your love tonight
I need your love tonight
You might also like
Oh oh-oh, I love you so
Uh uh, can't let you go
Ooh ooh, don't tell me no
I need your love tonight

Oh gee, the way you kiss
Sweetie, too good to miss
Wow-whee, want more of this
I need your love tonight

I've been waiting just for tonight
To do some lovin' and hold you tight
Don't tell me, baby, you gotta go
I got the hi-fi high and the lights down low

Hey now, hear what I say
Ooh wow, you better stay
Pow pow, don't run away
I need your love tonight
I need your love tonight
I need your love tonight
I need your love tonight
I need your love tonight1Embed
