1 ContributorZeppelin Lyrics
Yeah
This is nice  I like this
Yeah
It's coming here give me it for a second
Yeah
I introduce, myself, Kastr Ridge, Yeah
Gramatik

So I moved on
Hold strong, Hold on
Giving a life, Holding a mic, Turning a sign
Old songs kinda belong to our culture than he
We all along chose wrong
But I am good, ready to blossom

I waked up from the dream
And wanted to go to sleep
Wanted people to see different inside of me
Difference from the 
And separate from the beats
But everytime I stop I couldn't breathe
And time moves slow when you walk in no direction, (I will)
The light terms 
If you don't will can you hope for redemption?
Now your time's up and you're looking for reflection
Life's funny man
Watching every second
Now the hands on the clock
Don't stop for 
A life's lessons
Open up the questions
Counting up the minutes to the stop, Zeppelin

I'm gonna walk these steps
Only got 20 more in the rocking
A-a-a money, looking for recover
Welcome me to heaven

Rap did bloody plastic
Rap backflips
Get back to basics of 
I stumbled through the streets and hoping for find some seed
People are like she, very easy to defeat
Easily used to be
To fall for love for my speech
I am just trying to teach the generation that keeps
To open up the rise of the truth that's still in reach
It's a hardcore nightmare, people never fight fair
When they use  people everywhere
Hanging by a string, we are things to , (3x)
 (2x)
I'm gonna walk these steps
Only got 20 more in the rocking
A-a-a money, looking for recover
Welcome me to heaven
Yeah
God thanks
Just Zeppelin
