2 ContributorsBombs Away LyricsIt's time for an intervention
It's time for a little truth
It's time for a revolution
Grab a torch gonna light the fuse
Had enough of the desperation
Had enough of the crooked views
Had enough and it's time for action
3 2 1 no time to loose
Cuz this is time you gotta make your stand
Falls away let the casualties beat down
We don't want your consideration
We don't want to be recognized
We don't want your procrastination
Time is now to get organized
Fall in line, revolutionary
Fall in line, gonna win the war
Fall in line, you're another number
Call to arms now
1 2 3 4!

This time you gotta make your stand
Falls away let the casualties beat down
This time you gotta make your stand
Falls away let the casualties beat down

Had enough and it's time for action

This time you gotta make your stand
Falls away let the casualties beat down
This time you gotta make your stand
Falls away let the casualties beat down

This time you gotta make your stand
Falls away let the casualties beat down
This time you gotta make your stand
Falls away let the casualties beat downEmbed
