5 ContributorsBitch LyricsLets have a bachelor party
With chicks
And booze
And guns
And firetrucks
(C'mon, baby!)
(Come on, baby)
There's something about the way we fit
There's something about this psycho trip
There's something about the way we groove
Something's got me, and I just can't seem to choose
I want you!
But I hate you!
The one I love I hate, but the sex is great
The one I love I hate, but the sex is great
The one I love I hate, so I contemplate
The one I love I hate, but the sex is great
There's something about the way we slide
There's something about this psycho ride
There's something about the things we do
Something's got me and I just can't seem to choose
You might also likeI want you!
But I hate you...
The one I love I hate, but the sex is great
The one I love I hate, but the sex is great
The one I love I hate, so I contemplate
The one I love I hate, but the sex is great
(Come on, baby!)
One, two, fuck you
Never say no
Ready to go
We're out of control
But I can't let you, can't let you go! (Can't let you, can't let you)
There's something about the way we fit
There's something about this psycho bitch
The one I love I hate, but the sex is great
The one I love I hate, but the sex is great
The one I love I hate
And I could suffocate
The one I love I hate, but the sex is great
I love to hate you
You know I love to hate you
You know I love to hate you
You know I love to hate you
Hate you
Hate you
