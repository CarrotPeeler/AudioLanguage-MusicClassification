1 ContributorNoise Parade Lyrics(Verse)
Feel it in your head
Collapsing your chest
Bodies growing stiff
Tremors in your head
(Verse)
Tremor take control
Feeling on the floor
Gloom is glowing thin
Your shaking lips
(Chorus)
The noise parade
The noise parade
The noise parade
The noise parade
(Verse)
All alone to the end
Afraid to slip again
And your tired eyes
Tunets free again
(Chorus)
The noise parade
The noise parade
The noise parade
