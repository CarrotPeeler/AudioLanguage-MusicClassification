2 ContributorsJoe Harper Saturday Morning LyricsWhen ya thought I was a stranger
When you looked upon me
When I came back
But to take you from disaster
I cannot master the four winds in your shack
In the roamin', in the gloamin'
You have brought and set before me
And I think that it's an omen
I'm just not what so many people see
Chorus:
And you shined your glory all around
Do not disguise what we did
I asked you for half a pound and you said
'Go see Joe Harper saturday morning, kid'
'Go see Joe Harper saturday morning, kid'
And the child held a ball
In the garden with the old queen
And ya kissed her lips and heart
Another stranger, ya know what I mean
And ya walked the streets so lonely
In your own childish way
And ya thought that ya would only, ha
Do it for today

And just stood outside the club
And the rain came down on his head
And he got all soakin' wet
He said 'go for yourself'
And I said 'I know'
'Show Joe I ain't conquered yet'
And I walked away from the backstreets in the rain
And I saw how many times I had died
Then we turned on outside the bus shelter
And i jumped on and said 'good bye'
And I shined my glory all around
Did not disguise what I did
Tried to keep it underground
But they said
'Go see Joe Harper saturday morning, kid'
'Go see Joe Harper saturday morning, kid'Embed
