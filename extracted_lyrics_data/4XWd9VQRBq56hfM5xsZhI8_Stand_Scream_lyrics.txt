2 ContributorsStand LyricsDo you care to take a stand?
Try, try, try to understand
Should we want to remain the same?
Or do you want to see a change?
Should we want to lend a hand?
Find ourselves in other lands?
Or stand outside the door
For it’s harder to look than ignore - new
What’s old is new, around you, what’s new?
It’s time to take a stand -- Are you there?
Or if you see a change now will you stare?
If I ask you to use your mind, do you dare?
Or will you just lean up against a wall
Cause you’re scared if you stand you might fall?
Listen to what we got to say
Here are the screams of today
We’re not telling you what to do
We’re just asking questions of you
For we want to know just where you stand
Try to understand
For we are here to take a stand
To stand on the brink of something new
You might also likeWhat you think and what you do
Are just what we are questioning you
Can you see the missing link?
Through apathetic attitudes
What you feel and what you seek
Work a day, work a week
No, go happy lives
Day to day, are you satisfied?
Listen to what we got to say
Here are the screams of today
We’re not telling you what to do
We’re just asking questions of you
