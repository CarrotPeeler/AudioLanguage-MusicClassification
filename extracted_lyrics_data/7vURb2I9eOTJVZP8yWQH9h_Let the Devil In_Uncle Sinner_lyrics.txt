3 ContributorsLet the Devil In LyricsWell the Devil rode the back roads to Baltimore
With his hands all untied, the stain of sin
As he shuffled up from door to door
Shined up his shoes, combed back his hair
Drove into the silence like an engineer
Eyes half-open, no hurry to his pace
Mouth an open mark upon his angel face
Oh, the Devil sat his night as in Halifax
And he hid some bones 'neath the graveyard stones
He hid his name inside the railroad track
He sank in the ocean 'til he swam like a dog
Floated up the harbour on a hollow log
Hand on the bottle, head on the floor
Dreamed a devil's dream while you swallowed more
But he's just the Devil
He's just the Devil
You wanna let the Devil in
Now the Devil laid a black egg in Winnipeg
Another broken seed, another mouth to feed
A little fox startin' to incubate
Lyin' in the bedroom, hand in your hair
Perfect sense of emptiness for us to share
Moon like a splinter and the hail on the ground
I sent 'em off a thank you as the weight came down
You might also likeBut he's just the Devil
He's just the Devil
I wanna let the Devil in
But he's just the Devil
He's just the Devil
I wanna let the Devil winEmbed
