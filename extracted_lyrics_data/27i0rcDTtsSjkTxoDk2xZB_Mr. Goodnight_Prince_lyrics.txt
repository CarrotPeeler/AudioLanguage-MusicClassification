Mister, mister
Love you, mister
Come on

Call Mr. Goodnight
He'll make you feel alright
Make you throw your head back and holla
So nice, so nice
Better not tell your girlfriend
You can try with all your might (3121)
Just can't keep a secret
About goodnight, goodnight

Hey, baby, hey baby, hey, baby, sitting all alone in my courtyard
Looking as if you have every right
All over the world they call me Prince
But you can call me Mr. Goodnight
Surely the dandies that escort you places
Imparted a rumor or two
About the parade of lovely faces
That follow me, surely they do?
You might also likeWhat say you to that, with lips so inviting?
It's all I can do not to stare
What say you to them, past, present and future
That you don't care (I don't care)
If so, you'll be the first and I'll give you the keys
To the whip of your dreams, alright?
All over the world they call me Prince (yeah)
But you can call me Mr. Goodnight

Call Mr. Goodnight
He'll make you feel alright
Make you throw your head back and holla
So nice, so nice
Better not tell your girlfriend
You can try with all your might
Just can't keep a secret
About goodnight, goodnight

Now I don't want to put to you to sleep with a bunch of chatter
And a rap that really don't matter
But now that you know who I am, you need to make plans
And all your other pennies should scatter (scatter)
A limousine about to pick you up
And then take you to a private jet (too fine) (yeah)
And then you going to meet a little Spanish man
Who will offer you wine and Moet
In an hour or two, you'll be taken to a suite
That will rival your wildest dreams
And on the bed three dresses to choose one, pick one
Then you get a call from me (ring)
Tell me which dress you chose
So I can put on, put on my matching suit
All the real guys hold your hands up
You know how Mr. Goodnight do

Call Mr. Goodnight
He'll make you feel alright
Make you throw your head back and holla
So nice, so nice
Better not tell your girlfriend
You can try with all your might (3121)
Just can't keep a secret
'Bout goodnight, goodnight
I love you, baby
I don't want nobody else
Call Mr Goodnight (You can call him) (any time at all)
Call Mr Goodnight (yeah, yeah, yeah) (I love you, mister)

MP3, Mike Philly in the band got jams at midnight
Before the main attraction, you see
Slow it down somewhere here on Earth
Just to check how your reaction be
And if your heartbeat goes up a notch or two
There ain't no telling what I might do
But I got a mind full of good intentions
And a mouth full of Raisinets (better not tell you)
We can watch Chocolat on the big screen
Before we convene in the pool (yeah)
The waterfall'll wash your cares away
Already I love you, I do

Call Mr. Goodnight
He'll make you feel alright (Mister, mister)
Make you throw your head back and holla
So nice, so nice
Better not tell your girlfriend
You can try with all your might
Just can't keep a secret
About goodnight, goodnight

The energy in this field's been known to flicker lights, 'ight
A symphony with no rest, a capella moans and a bridge of sighs (goodnight) (call, call)
Undeterred, nevertheless, a masterpiece on butterscotch thighs (call, call)
Turn off the lights, turn off the lights
It's time for Mr. GoodnightEmbed
