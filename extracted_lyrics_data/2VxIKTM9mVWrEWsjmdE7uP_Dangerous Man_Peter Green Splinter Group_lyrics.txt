3 ContributorsDangerous Man LyricsDon't mess with me when you see me walking down the street
Or stare at my women whe she's standing next to me
I'll tell you once, I'll tell you twice
If there's a third time, it won't be nice
Don't mess with me - 'cos I'm a dangerous man
Don't mess with me just because I seem an easy guy
You can choose where you live
But you can't choose whee you're gonna die
I'll cause you trouble if you do me wrong
One day you're here, the next you'll be gone
Don't mess with me - 'cos I'm a dangerous man
Don't bother me and then maybe I won't bother you
You can say what you like
But you'd better make sure it's the truth
Don't come to me whe the goin's rough
No sympathy 'cos I've had enough
Don't mess with me - 'cos I'm a dangerous manYou might also likeEmbed
