3 ContributorsMiss You Love LyricsI've run out of complicated theories
So now I'm taking back my words
I'm preparing for the breakdown
Your t-shirt lost its smell of you
And the bathroom's still a mess
Remind me why we decided this was for the best...
Because I miss you love
I miss you love
Because I miss you love
I miss you love
Because I miss you love
I miss you love
I know the distance is a factor
But I stretch as often as I can
My goal is to reach your hands any day now
Please don't blame me for trying
To fix this one last time
I have a hard time as it is
Because I miss you love
I miss you love
Because I miss you love
I miss you love
Because I miss you love
I miss you love

Don't act like you don't know me
It's still me, I never changed
I'll be here when you come back
And I miss you love
I miss you love
And I miss you love
I miss you love
And I miss you love
I miss you love
And I miss you love
I miss you love
And I miss you love
I miss you love
And I miss you love
I miss you love
And I miss you love
I miss you loveEmbed
