1 ContributorMechanisms of Standstill LyricsA nation chose its side
A vote that justifies
Corruption, deceit, torture
Blind faith in selfish leaders
Whose only religion is greed
Imposing their beliefs on the world
Perverted picture of democracy
Trade your freedom
For the illusion of safety
Is it so much easier to bow?
In a state of control
This tendency to trust in
What controls you
Has left your nation paralyzed
Trade your freedom
A constant climate of fear
Maintained by the power-hungry
The abolition of free will
A divided people's truth
Isolated from the eyes of the world

Blessing or curse?
What a choice to make?
What a signal to send to the world?
Trade your freedom
For the illusion of safety
Is it so much easier to bow?
In a state of controlEmbed
