4 ContributorsInterlude Lyrics
Coolio, man
What you need to do, man
Is kick that old gangsta shit, man
Some of that "rollin' down the street in your '64
Slangin' your dope, blastin' on fools", you know?
Coolio, what about the women?
I mean, don't you wanna represent the sistas as well?
Why aren't you comin' up with somethin' for us?
A little encouragement, we wanna hear from you, too
Coolio, look, you had your humungous hit, "1, 2, 3, 4"
Now how 'bout this for a hip idea
"5, 6, 7, 8, who do we appreciate?"
Now we can win with that
Ayy, ayy, ayy, Coolio
Ayy, brotha
Ayy, brotha, check this out
What you gon' do for the people, huh?
Tell me, brotha
Tsk, mm, Coolio, you got it goin' on now
You know I always liked-ed-ed you
Tsk, when you gon' call me?
Tsk, With your ugly ass
Listen here, boy
Don't be listenin' to nothing they be sayin' out there 'cause
You the one
Look
All you gotta do
Is keep doin' what you're doin with your heart and your soulYou might also likeEmbed
