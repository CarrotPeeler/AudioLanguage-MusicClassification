Well, I was cooling, sitting by the phone waiting for
A ring with a female voice for a date or
An invitation to a nightclub for some mingling
Then ahhh, my phone started jingling
I picked it up, I checked the Rolex first
I'll call one of my regulars, worst come to worst
I said hello, but the voice sounded nervous
Baby, relax, F.P. at your service
The girl spoke up and her voice sounded very nice
I met you last week at that club called the Paradise
I said yeah, babe, I'd like to go there again
So get dressed and you better be fly, see you at 10
Hung up the phone and checked the mirror
Sort of like ESP, I could hear her
Heart beating encaged with the groove
And all I could say to myself was damn, this boy is smooth

Cos I don't get upset
Cos I don't get upset
Cos I don't get upset
Cos I don't get upset

So I pulled up to the club at the gate where they let celebs in
Entr√© vous in a Porsche 9-11 then
Girls took a look at me and started to break
Ladies, calm down, I've already got a date
Cruised up front and I was happy to find her
Tantalizing tasty tuna named Tanya
I said "Hey yo, babe, let's not go in the place yet
Come on, hop in, I got Luther in the tape deck"
I kicked the gift and the girl was like silly putty
She said "Let's go some place and chill" I said "Really, honey"
We went to the beach to take a little walk
I found out I was smoother than I thought
My hands, like Maverick, started to wander
Left then right then wound up behind her
Face-to-face and chest-to-chest then oooh
Like a spindle of silk, yo, this boy is smooth!

Cos I don't get upset
Cos I don't get upset
Cos I don't get upset
Cos I don't get upset

Here it is, verse tres, back at my place
The scene was set 'cause I set it before I left
Girl, I'm like a tool, grab me and use me
Where do you want me, by the fireplace or the jacuzzi?
I never slip, yo, I got my grip like a handle
Turn down the lights and lit up a candle
A bottle of chilled champagne right beside me
Radio booming, pumpin' the Isleys
Maybe I'll grab her and give her a kiss
Or kick her a line on the smooth Billy Dee tip
Or maybe I'll take her outside where the pool's at
Smack it up, flip it-- nah, I'm too cool for that
Ahh, I know what I'll do, I'll
Hold her tightly and caress her for a little while
Make it gentle and slow, not faster
A pause for the cause and here's a word from the master:
Yo, I'm the J-A double-Z, Jazzy
Smooth as self, smooth and I have to be
Known, acknowledged and recognized as the king of the groove
And I'm the man that blessed F.P. as smooth
Cos I don't get upset
Cos I don't get upset
Cos I don't get upset
Cos I don't get upset
Hey yo, J, take me out of here..Embed
