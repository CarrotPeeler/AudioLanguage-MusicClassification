Two bucks a ticket, got to get with it
On the night they have the battle of the bands
Shine up my new shoes, kick off my old blues
Night they have the battle of the bands

People comin' from miles around
Up, down, side of town
People spendin' their hard-earned cash
Hopin' that the battle's gonna be a smash, yes

Choose up a side and listen to the blues
Only ammunition that they ever, ever use
On the night they have the battle of the bands
On the night they have the battle of the bands

Jump up and down, jump up on the stage
People will be dancin' regardless of their age
On the night they have the battle of the bands
On the night they have the battle of the bands

Up, down, side of town
People spendin' their hard-earned cash
Hopin' that the battle's gonna be a smash

Tonight they have the battle of the bands
Yeah
Tonight, tonight they have the battle of the bands
Tonight they have the battle of the bands
Tonight they have the battle of the bands
Tonight they have the battle of the bands
