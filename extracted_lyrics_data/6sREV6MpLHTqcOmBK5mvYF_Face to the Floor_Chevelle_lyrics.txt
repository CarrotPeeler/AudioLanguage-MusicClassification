13 ContributorsFace to the Floor Lyrics
To pick up the tip doesn't mean a lot
Fiddle inside your drawers
If we own the night, then spread it out
Or pack up without a clue

Well, caused by their own
And by default
Time to vamanos

Like your face getting forced to the floor

Then I got a taste of the benefits
Five foot and change
There's no better way to hash it out
So let's set up your time to fail

Well course now the cracks
Should we intervene?
I hold this albatross

Like your face getting forced to the floor
And either way, you're way too close to it all
You might also like
Pay up, never wait 'em out
Clever, Madoff, take it all
Take it all
(Your mouth blessed)
Take it all the way, right back down
(Clueless mess)
Pay up, never take it all
Take it all
{Chorus]
Like your face getting forced to the floor
(In a league of your own)
And either way, you're way too close to it all
(You cannot veto the world)

Like your face (like your face)
Getting forced (getting forced) to the floor
(In a league of your own)
And either way (and either way)
You're way too close to it all
Too close to it allEmbed
