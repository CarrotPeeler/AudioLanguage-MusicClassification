I only go where I'm wanted
You go only where you want
I aim to be more like you
There is a ghost in my house
Rattling handles on every door
Show us an open window or two
Would you, ho-woah

Doors are starting to close and you drew a rose, my, my
Your mind, it is original, oh
Yeah, you're a skeleton key opening me, my, my
Your mind, it is original, girl, you're the original

Always were and always will be

The flowers of adaptation
Unfold and lovingly alarm
You effortlessly ring that bell
Your stripes are yours and yours only
The bough ideal of rare birds
And now I am under your spell
Ho-woah, under your spell
