You made me cry
When you said goodbye
Ain't that a shame?
My tears fell like rain
Ain't that a shame?
You're the one to blame

You broke my heart
When you said we'll part
Ain't that a shame?
My tears fell like rain
Ain't that a shame?
You're the one to blame

Oh, well, goodbye
Although I'll cry
Ain't that a shame?
My tears fell like rain
Ain't that a shame?
You're the one to blame

You might also like
You made me cry
When you said goodbye
Ain't that a shame?
My tears fell like rain
Ain't that a shame?
You're the one to blame

Oh well, goodbye
Although I'll cry
Ain't that a shame?
My tears fell like rain
Ain't that a shame?
You're the one to blame1Embed
