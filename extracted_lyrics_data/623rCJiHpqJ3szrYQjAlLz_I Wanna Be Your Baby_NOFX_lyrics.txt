4 ContributorsI Wanna Be Your Baby LyricsOpen your self, let me inside
Open your arms, I have nowhere
To go, so let me in to you
I need to be where nothing can hurt me
Open your legs, to let me crawl
Inside of you, I need to be
Inside your womb, so take me home
Inside of you, envelope me, I'm home
Bringin' me down
Bringin' me down
I wanna be your baby
Bringin' me down
Bringin' me down
Bringin' me down
I wanna be your baby
Bringin' me down
Open your lips and take me in
I need to be inside, within
Let me become a part of you
Let me inside of you, swallow me whole
I want to know the things you hide
I want to feel the things you feel
I want to breath the air you breathe
I want to live inside of you, take me

Bringin' me down
I wanna be your baby
Bringin' me down
Bringin' me down
Bringin' me down
I wanna be your baby
Bringin' me down
Let me live inside
