1 ContributorTravel LyricsI met a man
At the age of eighteen I was
We went to Detroit
He played the guitar
I played the harmonica
Travelling free
Working for the music
Life's a gamble when you're
Working for the music
Hey hey
Say hey hi
I went to New York
At the age of twenty-two I was
I met a man
He gave me a job construction
I worked hard in the daytime
And partied all night
I moved to California
At the age of twenty-five I was
Oh yeah
I met a woman
Nina Simone
She taught me how to write
I played the guitar
In a local bar
