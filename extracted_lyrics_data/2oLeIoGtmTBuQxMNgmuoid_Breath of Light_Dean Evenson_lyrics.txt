4 ContributorsLighthouse Lyrics
I've been tryin'
Tryna find my way back home
Cannot make it on my own
In the storm
It was raging and roaring
I saw it

Man, I really hope we can all float
In this storm that we're trapped in
'Cause the ocean is so cold
And the water's like black ink
We're all lost at sea
Lookin' for a brighter day
It's like life's full of tidal waves
But believe me, those ups and downs will help you find your way, ayy
And there's a sea full of demons
Tryna get a good grip on my tail ()
But I'm blessed by the breath
Of an angel that keeps putting wind in my sails (Amen)
And if they get your soul
Man, that's somеthing that you'll never get back
'Causе in a world that profits off your self-doubt (Come on)
To love yourself is a rebellious act, yo (Oh)
And there's a house full of lights (Lights)
Always watchin' where I go (Go)
And I'm drawn to it's shine ()
Like a moth to a lightbulb (Bulb)
But just know (Yo)
You can reach heights that no man's climbed (Yeah)
You can breath life into all mankind
'cause you been a light the whole damn time
You might also like
I've been tryin'
Tryna find my way back home
Cannot make it on my own
In the storm
It was raging and roaring
I saw it

Like a lighthouse
Shining down across the night
Like a million stars inside my mind
It's the fire that ignites
All these diamonds in the dark
Somebody show me the light
Somebody show me the light
Somebody show me the light

4 AM
I'm out on the streets and I'm ridin'
I'm all types of fucked up
It's freezin' cold and dead quiet
Tears runnin' down my face
As I peddle this 10-speed
Man, my girl just left me
Got home and the whole damn wardrobe was empty
She was my bestie
I was at the studio, the irony of a cruel world
'Cause as she was packin', I was rappin'
"Lean on you, all about you, girl"
And I know things haven't been great
But I can't help but think I would've saved this
If I just sped home, I would've played it
But I just missed you, I was too late, shit
I let you slip through my fingers and I know
It's all my fault, I had your love and lost it
Five years of love and laughter
Now down the drain, gone and shipped off in boxes
And now I'm flickin' through the radio
And everyone is playin' Dean Lewis like a twisted joke
And what's more, today is my birthday
I couldn't make story up any worse, ayy
Now I'm callin' up the Devil just to party like a demon
Goin' off the rails 'cause I'm heart broken
Then I plunge into a sea of sadness with a cannonball
Around my neck and now I'm drowning in this ocean
Got Eso calling me like, "What the hell? You MIA for weeks
And missed a whole 'nother studio session"
Oh, Lord, somebody pull me out the sea
But ain't nobody gonna save me but me
I've been tryin'
Tryna find my way back home
Cannot make it on my own
In the storm
It was raging and roaring
I saw it

Like a lighthouse
Shining down across the night
Like a million stars inside my mind
It's the fire that ignites
All these diamonds in the dark
Somebody show me the light
Somebody show me the light
Somebody show me the light

Ain't nobody gonna save me but me
Ain't nobody gonna pull me out the sea but me
Ain't nobody gonna save you but you
Ain't nobody gonna come and rescue you but you
Ain't nobody gonna save me but me
Ain't nobody gonna pull me out the sea but me
Ain't nobody gonna save you but you
Ain't nobody gonna come and rescue you but youEmbed
