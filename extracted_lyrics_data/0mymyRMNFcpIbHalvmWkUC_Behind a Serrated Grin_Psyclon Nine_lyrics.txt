1 ContributorBehind a Serrated Grin LyricsWhat you pray for, a maimed savior
Bathed in rancor to punish their behavior
Your institution of persecution
One solution to start from a clean slate
He doesn't say that he will save us
He doesn't say that he will save us
He says that we will save ourselves
Behind a serrated grin, he fails to hide his serrated grin
