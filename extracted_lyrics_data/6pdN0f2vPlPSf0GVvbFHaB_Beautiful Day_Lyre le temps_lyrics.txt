3 ContributorsBeautiful Day Lyrics
Da-ba-da-ba-da-ba
(It's a beautiful day)
(Beautiful day)
(With my beautiful day)
(It's a beautiful...)

I'll be right on time for today or another
'Cause when I wake up I feel better with you, if you
Stay at mine, you can stay forever
When I'm with you, darling
Then it's a beautiful day, ooh-oh-oh
It's a beautiful day, ooh-oh-oh
It's a beautiful day, ooh-oh-oh
It's a beautiful day, darling

I thought I'd never met this little thing you call love
I'm not the kind of brother that you can 
Nobody never ever told me
Oh, it's beautiful
How, it's beautiful
When you hold my hand
When you hold my hand
When you hold my hand
Oh, it's beautiful
How, it's beautiful
When you hold my hand
(Beautiful day, so beautiful day, so beautiful day, so beautiful day, so beautiful day, so beautiful day, so beautiful)
(Oh-oh, it's a beautiful day)

I'll be right on time for today or another
'Cause when I wake up I feel better with you, if you
Stay at mine, you can stay forever
When I'm with you, darling
Then it's a beautiful day, ooh-oh-oh
It's a beautiful day, ooh-oh-oh
It's a beautiful day, ooh-oh-oh
It's a beautiful day, darling

I know what you are saying, when you're talking about love
I just need to be singing and singing and singing it, more, and more, am I
Under a spell? I can't see nothing around
Ooh, nothing else but the sound of my baby
But the sound of my baby
But the sound of my baby
But the sound of my ba-by

I'll be right on time for today or another
'Cause when I wake up I feel better with you, if you
Stay at mine, you can stay forever
When I'm with you, darling
Then it's a beautiful day, ooh-oh-oh
It's a beautiful day, ooh-oh-oh
It's a beautiful day, ooh-oh-oh
It's a beautiful day, darling1Embed
