4 ContributorsBe Easy Lyrics
Some people say
You've got to fight for a love that's true
Climb every mountain
To see every trial and tribulation through
And I'm here to tell you
Ooh, that's only half the lesson, yeah
Now if you want a girl to come to you
You've got to leave a little room for guessin', yeah

Oh, just be easy, baby
That girl'll come running to you
If you just be easy, baby
Ah, she'll be easy, too

Don't you know it's just a fool who plays the part
Running a girl down like she's a game in a schoolyard?
Now if she waits, you should turn and let her alone
She'll come to you just as sure as you're born

Be easy, baby
That girl'll come running to you
If you just be easy, baby
Ah, she'll be easy, too
You might also like
Don't you know a woman don't want a man down on his knees? No
Running her down like a mouse after cheese
You've got to be mettle if you want her affection
You get too excited, and she's off in another direction, oh

So be easy, baby
That girl'll come running to you
If you just be easy, baby
Ah, she'll be easy, too

Oh oh oh, be easy, baby
Oh, that girl'll come running to you, yeah yeah, uh-huh
Now, now, now, be easy, babyEmbed
