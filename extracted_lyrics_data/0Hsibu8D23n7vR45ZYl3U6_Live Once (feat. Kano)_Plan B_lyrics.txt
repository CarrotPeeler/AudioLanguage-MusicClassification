3 ContributorsKnight Of The East Lyrics
Once upon a time in Medina’s skyline they was shooting stars
The kids played cops and robbers
You get popped, collared
In Black Eden crotch covered in collards
These cash crops we rich by the olives
The block’s hot you soppin’ wet
There’s no solace where the buck stops
They unbothered by a mother’s holler
But I knew where every spot was
I knew where every spot was

Beef and broccoli off Gates
Once copped over 40 nicks from Ne in broad day
They 24 hours on Van Buren now that’s endurance
191st and Post had the most purest
We did bout 10 transactions in three touches
Shouts to mami on Pulaski
When you copped she threw in free Dutches
This before the trap these was escape hatches
From the structures that crush us the masses
Overstand in a supplier’s hand I was a Draw Four High Joker
Connect clientele like a broker
Town spokesman for loud smokers
Watch the Dow Jones price per pound up and down like Oprah
Full disclosure wool pullover Polo Yacht Club
I’m starboard toward the spark plug
I knew where every spot was
I knew where every spot was
You might also like
I knew where every spot was
I knew where every lodge was

Northern stars we looking east
Those wit the beast marks
We snarl there’s gold on his teeth
Screams haunt the breeze
Bass breaking they knees
Gray hands breaking up beanstalks
Jason, not the face but the fleece
We like the flea gods
Without needing center seat
These niggas seesaw
See “SAW” they say to break free
Mean sawing feet off (nah)
Never square unless I stand on it
Betting on Cav not doing the math don’t plan for it
Block guru sudoku genie
Got teachings from Mfundisi
They monitor if you make it look too easy
The cabal sneaky slip on like moccasins
Tupac autopsy pics creepy Bambaataa sins

(The spirit of control is as the spirit of witchcraft.)
We jumped in they Duncan strict ritualist
Spliff lift to my lip “gang gang” flip mudras to shift
Bourgeoisie significance
They swab your inner cheek
Apply the stop and frisk
City to city, Citizen Kane sniff
Lineage peep forefathers espionage
Ask Denmark when son said his pops FBI
He said he knew that Yacubian blue stayed recessive
But he was in cahoots with the men in closed session
That’s the unseen hand stopping to work in its dirty plans
Pomp and circumstance out from the curtains they pranced out
In purple threads
The hall decorated with heads of pecking orders of where
Seven pounds of flesh settles debts (yo)
And I won’t let that stop us
I knew where every lodge was
Yo, I knew where every lodge was

See? Cuz all they life they been wanting control
And if they can’t control, they take control
Or they kill that which is in their way
Even their mamas…Embed
