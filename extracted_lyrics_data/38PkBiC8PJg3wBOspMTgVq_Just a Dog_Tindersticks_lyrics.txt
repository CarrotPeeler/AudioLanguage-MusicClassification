5 ContributorsJust a Dog LyricsOut here in the street
Is not where I want to be
Under her feet
Just to be with her
The sheets are on the line billowing
We'll sleep with the smell of the breeze
The places I've been
Or someone I used to be
Out here in the street
Nothing grows
There's nothing that I don't
Already own
There's a big big world in there
And I want it all
From the tips of her hair
To the core
I'm just a dog
Training to be a man
I'm just a dog
Learning stuff I don't understand
But at night I howl
But at night I howl
And even though I hate it
I need a good bathing
A long untangling
Cause my heart's aching
I'm just a dog
Training to be a man
I'm just a dog
But at night I howl
Just a dog
I'm just a dogSee Tindersticks LiveGet tickets as low as $55You might also likeEmbed
