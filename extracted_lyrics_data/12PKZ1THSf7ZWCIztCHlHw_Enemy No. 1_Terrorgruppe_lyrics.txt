1 ContributorEnemy No. 1 Lyrics
Look at your house and your family
I show you how mean life can be
Right now

You got a healthy bank account
I stress you out with punk-rock sound
Hell yeah

I am your enemy number one
I am your enemy number one
I am your enemy number one, number one

Look at your brand new Cadillac
Look at me, I'm a maniac
Right now

Your garden is in a perfect shape
I mess it up, I'm a human ape
Hell yeah

I am your enemy number one
I am your enemy number one
I am your enemy number one, number one
I am your enemy number one
I am your enemy number one
I am your enemy number one, number one

I am your enemy number one
I am your enemy number one
I am your enemy number one
I am your enemy number one
I am your enemy number one
I am your enemy number one


I am your enemy number one
I am your enemy number one
I am your enemy number one, number one
I am your enemy number one
I am your enemy number one
I am your enemy number one, number one
Number one, number one
Number one, number oneEmbed
