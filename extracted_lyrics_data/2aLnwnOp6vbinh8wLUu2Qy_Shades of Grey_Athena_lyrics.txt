Same minds know impatience
Be here sit on my floor
I just be here sit on my floor, yehhe
Same Heights in embracing
To be here sit on my own
I just be here sit in my zone
Sit on my floor, yehhe

Truth be the science say
I feel a type of way
Dark in my shades of grey
Yehh..

Truth be untold
The proof in the pudding
Im feeling bloated on blessings
I reap what i sow
Still feeding my soul
See wisdom now play like a weapon
They outta control, their ego patrol
Feeling the distant connection but feeling is all
Im holding your cross
Love like a sacrifice given
Just me, say its just me
Real brudah on endz tryna feel free
Like footy with a touch of me ballin now
Hard grind, keep my hands dirty
Washing my sins away
Been with a cape but im falling now
Loose string of a word, see me calling out
All in doubt, am i all in now?
Do i run my mouth, just to walk away?
You might also like
Same minds know impatience
Be here sit on my floor
I just be here sit on my floor, yehhe
Same Heights in embracing
To be here sit on my own
I just be here sit in my zone
Sit on my floor, yehhe

Truth be the science say
I feel a type of way
Dark in my shades of grey
Yehh..

Playbacks a skull
Mind blown attention
Seeing no witnesses, i vow to keep to myself
Divorcing your trust, feeling your spirit possessive
Return to the dust
Sweep by the wind
Lost in direction in pressure to creep on a sin
Securing protection
Vowing to give you a ring
Life on a line
Pipe on a line
My summer time
Fight for a fucking Dime cost, My hero
Heights for the shine, high for the grind
Blind for a night
My fucking time loss, my zero
Light me a sign, Find me a bone
Right set of mind
I'm on a i'm God, play hero
Like humankind, knight honour my sword
Might in a fight
Know a tail fox, skin boil
Tribe in my heart
God on my sleeve
Light in the dark
Sword in the stone tossed, my fear show
Bite from a dawg, bark in the park
Hype for the mic
Charge in the port, know my ship fall
Charge set in me, time ticking bomb
Tardis in me
Silent alarm
Pop my ego
Wile on a street, violent release
I may be free
Why i'm feeling so lost my people?
Same minds know impatience
Be here sit on my floor
I just be here sit on my floor, yehhe
Same Heights in embracing
To be here sit on my own
I just be here sit in my zone
Sit on my floor, yehhe1Embed
