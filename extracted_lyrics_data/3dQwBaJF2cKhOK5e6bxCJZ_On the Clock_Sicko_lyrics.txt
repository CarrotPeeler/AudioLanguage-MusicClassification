3 ContributorsOn The Clock Lyrics
This place is always hiring a brand new bunch of morons
It must be rather tiring squeezing blood from doorknobs
'Cause this is your life, and it's goin' nowhere
And it's your fault you're here, it's not our place to care
I don't get paid enough for this, the stress might break my back
Working with idiots will give you a heart attack
'Cause this is your life, and you're goin' nowhere
They don't pay me enough to pretend that I care

And all we do is sit around and talk
And dream about the day we're gonna walk
Smile! You're on the clock

Here comes Jim the supervisor, everyone look busy
Don't forget to smile at him, he thinks it's a conspiracy
'Cause this is his life, and he's goin' nowhere
They don't pay him to think, they don't pay him to care

And all we do is sit around and talk
And dream about the day we're gonna walk
Smile! You're on the clock
You might also like

Resent the upper management, they treat us like children
If it weren't for the free donuts, we'd probably have to kill them
'Cause this is our life, and we're goin' nowhere
They don't pay me enough to pretend that I care

And all we do is sit around and talk
And dream about the day we're gonna walk
And laugh about all the clowns we mock
Smile! You're on the clockEmbed
