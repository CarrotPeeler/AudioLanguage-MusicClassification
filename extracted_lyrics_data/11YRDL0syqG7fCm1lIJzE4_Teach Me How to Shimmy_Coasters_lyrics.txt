You taught me how to boogie real slow, yeah
You taught me how to twist and you taught me how to slop
Mama teach me one thing more
Come on and teach me how to shimmy like you and daddy do
Teach me how to shimmy so I can shimmy too
Mama there's gonna be a dance tonight
You gotta teach me double quick, yeah
And mama if I can't do it right
You know Chico’s gonna steal my chick
Come on and teach me how to shimmy like you and daddy do
Teach me how to shimmy so I can shimmy too
I can Hully Gully good as Chico can
But mama Hully Gully ain't with it
My little girl, she loves the Wiggle and Chicken
There's only one thing gonna gеt it
Now teach me how to shimmy like you and daddy do
Tеach me how to shimmy so I can shimmy too
Teach me how to shimmy like you and daddy do
Teach me how to shimmy like you and daddy do
