2 ContributorsAll Because of You LyricsI can remember the day when I had nothing to say
Just look at me now, I'm shouting (hey, hey, hey)
Ooh, I feel good, ooh, I feel good
But ain't no doubt about it
It's all because of you, baby
All because of you, woman
All because of you, baby
All because of you, yeah
You don't know, you don't know
You don't know what it's like (hey, hey, hey)
To be happy again to have so many friends
Just when I thought it was the end
And it's all because of you, baby
All because of you, woman
All because of you, baby
All because of you, yeah
(Hey, hey, hey)
You got me, you got me, you got me, wooh
Ah, ah, ah, ah
I remember the day when I had nothing to say
Just look at me now I'm shouting (hey, hey, hey)
Ooh, I feel good, ooh, I feel good
But ain't no doubt about it
You might also likeAnd it's all because of you, baby
All because of you, woman
All because of you, baby
All because of you
And let me hear you shout it (hey, hey, hey)
I wanna hear you shout it (hey, hey, hey)
Come on, come on shout it (hey, hey, hey)
Shout, shout it, shout it (hey, hey, hey)
I wanna hear you shout it (hey, hey, hey)
I wanna hear you shout it (hey, hey, hey)
Come on and hear me shout it, now (hey, hey, hey)
Shout, shout it, shout it (hey, hey, hey)
Shout, shout it, shout it (hey, hey, hey)
I wanna hear you shout it (hey, hey, hey)Embed
