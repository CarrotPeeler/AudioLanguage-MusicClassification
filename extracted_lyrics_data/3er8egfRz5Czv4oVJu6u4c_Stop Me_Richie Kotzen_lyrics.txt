1 ContributorStop me LyricsIt's too late this time, this I know
I gave all myself up to her
Now I should start again and shut the door
But I don't know myself anymore
I don't know where I am
Don't know where I'm going
I just need somebody to stop me
Cuz I feel like I'm losing control
You're haunting me
Everywhere I go you're in my head, and you're in my heart
I can't get away, even when I'm dreaming
I'm gonna drive all night, ain't gonna sleep
Clear my head for a while, maybe I'll see
Where I went all wrong, turn up some dust
It seemed so easy for me when I was three
(That was long ago, now he doesn't know, heaven hell or reason)
I just need somebody to stop me
Cuz I feel like I'm losing control
You're haunting me
Everywhere I go you're in my head, and you're in my heart
I can't get away, even when I'm dreaming
Tell me where I am, tell me where I was
Tell me where I'm going too
I just need somebody to stop me
Cuz I feel like I'm losing control
You're haunting me
Everywhere I go you're in my head, and you're in my heart
I can't get away, even when I'm dreamingYou might also likeEmbed
