1 ContributorGive You Till Monday LyricsWent away and you left me
Never  said no word
Went  away and you left me
Took off like a bird
Ooh, but I'll give you till Monday
Yes,  I'll give you till Monday
Give  you till Monday
Now I'll be moving on
Down  the road
Well, I'll think I'll go down south now
Take a ride on the ferry boat queen
Go down to Mississippi
Then  I'll have a time to dream
Oh, but I'll give you till Monday, yes
Oh, I'll give you till Monday
Give you till Monday
Moving on
Down the road I'm going
Baby, I've got my ticket, yeah
Ain't coming no more alright, yes
I'll think I'll go down south now
Take a ride on the ferry boat queen
Go down to Mississippi
But then I'll have time to dream

Give you till Monday
Oh, and I'll be moving on
Down the road, down the road, down the road
Oh, I'm moving down, yeah
I'm not coming down no moreEmbed
