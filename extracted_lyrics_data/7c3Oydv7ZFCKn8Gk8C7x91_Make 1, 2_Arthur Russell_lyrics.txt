Who sees me waiting for my friend
Oo-and I cross the street, make a bee line for that phone
Oh-oh that I'm the  one to make it happen
Oh to live to find a friend
Someone tried to call me up
But I don't even have a phone
She could ask to me what's up
But I'm waiting for your call to end
Then someone across the street
Who sees me waiting for my friend
She could ask to me what's up
I'm waiting for your call to end
Someone tried to call me up
But I don't even have a phone
It's like my friends don't know I'm here
But I'm a person on my own
But I cross the street, make a bee-line for that phone
I'm the one to make it happen
Hard to find a friend
I make a bee-line
Hard Hard to find a friend
Off I cross the street
And find on a bee-line
I'm on a bee-line
Hard to make a bee-line
Oh I make a bee-line
Across the street
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh I cross the streetYou might also likeEmbed
