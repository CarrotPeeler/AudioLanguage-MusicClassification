General on the buttons

I'm-I’m tryna keep an Unknown T, Get get the pack n then split it
Cash-Cash Motto like Chip is, Hash with the Lemon (??) mix this
I told her baby don't force it, I must have been waved if I DigDat
She's a friendly one, a Headie one so you know I can’t kiss that

And boy better know like Skepta that I'm killing these beats like Wretch does
In the jungle-like Mowgli, Loose like Loski, spit real on the beat like Lowkey
Gyal-pree come young and I spray really the most
Far from vain tho but I'm Smooth like Bane tho
Light skin one why you acting a Fredo
Imma Ps n Qs like Kano
I might dagga dagga dat like Sneakbo
I might squeeze that one like Reeko
I don't need no advice like Deno
And man don't pay for potter I need that Pronto
I might march in need like I'm Moscow
Why certain man they pretend tho
When they haven't even seen that Skengdo
I want more than Ks in the trap
I'm really tryna see business that’s racks
Not just Poundz I need a likkle money on the Santan
Dem man tell stories Rapman
My youngers causing Mischief
I pray bad energy stay far away but I’m still hopping that Wizkid
You might also likeRemember I was moving rocks nobody didn't show no love
Man I gotta make it flip whether it coming Ambush or bud ay
I’m tryna see large amounts hoping that it all adds up ay
Said I'm tryna see large amounts hoping that it all adds up ay

I'm-I'm tryna keep an Unknown T, Get get the pack n then split it
Cash-Cash Motto like Chip is, Hash with the Lemon (??) mix this
I told her baby don’t force it, I must have been waved if I DigDat
She's a friendly one, a Headie one so you know I can't kiss that

Never been witness usually suspects I was on my draws just grinding
Thinking about the times that we gunna be doing up Giggs and shining
I ain't tryna deal with no Skrapz
Peng ting tens or the Nines ??? peak if she wasting time
Same time ?? hate when she Bugzy
I just want her to leave me alone
But she a Paigey Cakey one I might have to take her Krept and Kones
She think I'm fly like Aladdin and she thinks that I'm making Not3s
Same time feds all over the town, Tryna see us and Taze man down
Would have thought that my blade was brown
Would have thought that my brown was blade
Snap Capone if I put on these shades
They didn't give a Hus when I was on my Js
Really in a rush tryna get myself paid, Now man is with Blanco everyday
But I pray to God that I don't let the Devlin
Tryna hit the belly and keep it on the low but the packs out here be stenchin
I'm-I'm tryna keep an Unknown T, Get get the pack n then split it
Cash-Cash Motto like Chip is, Hash with the Lemon (??) mix this
I told her baby don't force it, I must have been waved if I DigDat
She's a friendly one, a Headie one so you know I can't kiss thatEmbed
