In muddy waters
I am on my guard
I better duck
Stay on my side
Hungry I am
We living beings only
Try to stay alive
I don't really want
To tangle with
And it's wise
To realise my size - in here
Wise to realise that mice
I should never eat them
Sometimes I'd like
To be exempted
From the daily fight
For kindness and for acceptance
Sometimes I try
To understand it
I cannot survive
Without adjustment and compromise

And it's wise
To realise my size - in here
Wise to realise that mice
I should never eat them
Wise
To realise my size - in here
Wise to realise that mice
I should never eat them
I should never eat themEmbed
