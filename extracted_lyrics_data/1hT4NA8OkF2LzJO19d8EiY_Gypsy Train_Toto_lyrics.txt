It's no problem, this is whatcha gotta do
Telephone your baby, tell her that you're workin' late
Come and pay a visit, please don't hesitate
Come join the party, come along and be our guest
Sit back and let us do the rest, we're the best, yeah
Come on an' meet me at the station
Don't pack your bags, just fix your hair
Gotta get up, gotta get in, gotta get out
Just look for me, I'm always there
Come on let's ride, ride that gypsy train
All aboard, now don't you be afraid
Come on let's ride, ride that gypsy train
Feed the fire, let's go one mo' time again
Medication, little love and sympathy
Cool libation, it's complimentary
Play a little poker, love when the stakes are high
Lotta nasty women, givin' everyone the eye
Say downtown Jimmy, tell me whatcha need
Satisfaction guaranteed, guaranteed, yeah
