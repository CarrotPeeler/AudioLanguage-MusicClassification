Got love if you want it, babe
Got love if you want it
Got love if you want it
Got love if you want it
We can rock awhile
We can rock awhile
Quit teasin' me, babe
Quit teasin' me, babe
With your fine brown frame
With your fine brown frame
If you let me love you, babe
I'll be your lovin' man
I'll be your lovin' man
Now, here you come, babe
Now, here you come, babe
With your hair combed down
With your hair combed down
I know you been ballin'
Talk's all over town
Talk's all over town
Now, the next door neighbor
Now, the next door neighbor
Peepin' through the blind
Peepin' through the blind
Don't worry, nobody
That's all this time
That's all this time
I love you, little woman
I love you, little woman
But then I do myself
But then I do myself
But you mistreat me, baby
For someone else
For someone else
For someone else
For someone elseYou might also likeEmbed
