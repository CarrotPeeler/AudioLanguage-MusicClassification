4 ContributorsChevrolet Lyrics
In a flat Forty-One with my Strat by the door
We was going to the country
For what we came for
I'm sure you've smelled the trees in the air
The best of motor cruising's
Just the joy to get there

I was approaching Simonton
Down by the cotton gin
There was old man Berkman
Trying to flag me in
He asked if I would stay awhile
And if I needed gas
I said, "No thanks anyhow
I don't drive too fast"

Hallelujah, hallelujah
Ride my Chevrolet
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Ride my Chevrolet

I took the road down to Cinco
Through that red Brazos River land
Done hit that freeway at sunset
Now the big city lights are at hand
See ZZ Top LiveGet tickets as low as $68You might also like
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Ride my Chevrolet
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Ride my ChevroletEmbed
