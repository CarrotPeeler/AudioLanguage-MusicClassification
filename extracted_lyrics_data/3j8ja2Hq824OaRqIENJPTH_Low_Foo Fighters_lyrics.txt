Hey you, are you in there?
I'm stuck outside you, ooh-ooh
We could use one another
Another like you, ooh-ooh

You be my passerby
I'll be your new one to pass through
Screws inside turn so tight
Turning on you, I'm hangin' on you, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh

Baby blue (baby blue) don't go nowhere (don't go nowhere)
I'm right beside you, ooh-ooh
Me and you (me and you) goin' nowhere (goin' nowhere)
I'm right beside you, ooh-ooh

You be my passerby
I'll be your new one to pass through
Screws inside turn so tight
Turning on you, I'm hangin' on you

Takin' you as low as you go
As low as you go
Takin' you as low as you go
As low as you go
You might also like
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh

You be my passerby
I'll be your new one to pass through
Screws inside turn so tight
Turning on you, I'm hangin' on you

Takin' you as low as you go (low as you go)
As low as you go (low as you go)
Takin' you as low as you go (low as you go)
As low as you go (as low as you go)

(Low as you go, as low as you go)
(Low as you go, as low as you go)
(Low as you go)

Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

Takin' you as low as you go
As low as you go
Takin' you as low as you go
As low as you go
Takin' you as low as you go (low as you go)
As low as you go (low as you go)
Takin' you as low as you go (low as you go)
As low as you go (as low as you go)
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh2Embed
