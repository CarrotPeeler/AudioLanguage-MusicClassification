Henry got a letter
Said his mother was dead
Put his children on a passenger train
He gonna ride the blinds, Lordy
He gonna ride the blinds

Henry looked down the railroad track
Saw the steel driver comin' down
'Fore I let that steel driver beat me down
Die with a hammer in my hand
I'm gonna die with a hammer in my hand

Henry went on the mountaintop
Give his horn a blow
Last words his captain said
"John Henry was a natural man
John Henry was a natural man"

Henry had a woman
The dress she wore was red
Run on down that railroad track
Goin' where John Henry fell dead
Yes, I'm goin' where John Henry fell dead
You might also like
Henry had a baby boy
Holdin' his mama's hand
Last words that poor boy said
"Gonna learn to be a steel drivin' man
Yes, I'll learn to be a steel drivin' man"Embed
