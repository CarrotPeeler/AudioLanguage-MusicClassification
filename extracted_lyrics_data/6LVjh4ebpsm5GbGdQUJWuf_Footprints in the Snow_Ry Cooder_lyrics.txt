1 ContributorFootprints In The Snow Lyrics
Well, some folks like the summertime they can walk about
Strolling through the meadow green, it's pleasant there's no doubt
But to me the wintertime is the best of all
'Cause I found her when the snow was on the ground

Now, I traced her little footprints in the snow
I found her little footprints in the snow
I bless that happy day when Nellie lost her way
'Cause I found her when the snow was on the ground

Now the Ladies Garment Workers walked out last wintertime
One little union kitty was a dear sweetheart of mine
She walked around all winter on the picket line
But I found her when the snow was on the ground

Now, the Union Strike Committee didn't like me hangin' round:
Don't interfere with sisters while the strike is on
Don't go around behaving like a ring-tailed tom
But I found her when the snow was on the ground

'Cause I traced her little footprints in the snow
I found her little footprints in the snow
And I bless that happy day when Nellie lost her way
'Cause I found her when the snow was on the ground
You might also like

She's somewhere out there marching with the union band
We'll get back together when the pension check comes in
But every time the snow falls, it brings back memories
'Cause I found here when the snow was on the ground

I traced her little footprints in the snow
Yah, I found her little footprints in the snow
I bless that happy day when Nellie lost her way
'Cause I found her when the snow was on the groundEmbed
