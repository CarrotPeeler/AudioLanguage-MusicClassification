A sense of foreboding never tasted before
Fell through the floor, I’ve hit my ceiling
Out of my depth, over my head
Cloud Cuckoo-land was clearly in view
My magic bullet, blunt and unglued
Fell through the floor, bounced off the ceiling
Bolt for the door, out of my head
A voice from the north shouted: “Do it my way!”

I threw myself flat on to your border fence
The damage I did is in self defence
Fell through the floor, I reached my ceiling
Out of my depth, over my headYou might also likeEmbed
