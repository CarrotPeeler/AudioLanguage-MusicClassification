No
No
No, yeah

I can't figure you out to save myself
It would help if you would talk to me
(Baby, talk to me)
You keep switchin' it up girl, I can tell
You ain't sure just where you wanna be, yeah

One minute it's like we're so inseparable (So inseparable)
The next second it's like you ain't feelin' this no more
(No)
I know you wanna be close but ya scared so you push away
Just tell me which side of you I'm getting today, oh yeah

Chameleon, I see your true colors
You can hide but the truth don't lie
You don't wanna get hurt this time
You're just like a
Chameleon, I see your true colors
Everyday is a new disguise
Wanna get to know the one inside
Chameleon
See Joe LiveGet tickets as low as $87You might also like
Now I ain't tryin' to start no argument
(No baby, no baby, no baby)
I'm just sayin' that I don't understand
Girl, the closer I get to knowin' you
I realize the further away I really am, oh

One minute, it's like we're floating on a cloud
(Floating)
The next second I swear it's like the rain is pouring down, yeah
Whenever we get close you get scared and you push away
Just tell me which side of you I'm getting today?

Chameleon, I see your true colors
You can hide but the truth don't lie
You don't wanna get hurt this time
You're just like a
Chameleon, I see your true colors
Everyday is a new disguise
(I wanna get to know)
Wanna get to know the one inside
Chameleon

Sometimes you wanna hide away
When it all seems too much
But runnin' doesn't take away the pain
I know that it's a lot to ask but this is serious
Just promise me your heart will never change, oh
Chameleon, I see your true colors
You can hide but the truth don't lie
You don't wanna get hurt this time
You're just like a
Chameleon, I see your true colors
Everyday is a new disguise
I wanna get to know the one inside
(I get to know the one inside)
Chameleon
Chameleon, I see your true colors
You can hide but the truth don't lie
You don't wanna get hurt this time
You're just like a
Chameleon, I see your true colors
Everyday is a new disguise
(I wanna get to know)
Wanna get to know the one inside
Chameleon

Oh, oh, yeah, baby
I wanna know who you areEmbed
