The time has come, get ready now
This is the start of the big mash up-mash up...

Got you all ready now
Prepare for the ride
Droppin' on the bass now
And do it all night
Gotta get down, gotta get a move on
Gotta get down, gonna turn you on
Gotta get down, gonna feel the heat
Keep 'em high - David doesn't eat!

A walk in the park, a step in the dark
A walk in the park, a trip in the dark
I'm getting away, escaping today

There's everybody in the place
Tell this much is true
A change to unlock now
Like the Electric Zoo
Gotta get down, gotta get a move on
Gotta get down, gonna come along
Gotta get down, gonna feel the beat
It's a fact - David doesn't eat!

Gotta get down, gotta get a move on
Gotta-gotta get down, gonna come along
Gotta-gotta-gotta get down, gonna feel the beat
It's a fact - David doesn't eat!

A walk in the park, a step in the dark
E-yeah-yeah! Come on!
A walk in the park, a trip in the dark
Oh yeah, oh yeah
I'm getting away, escaping today
Come on!
Today, a walk in the park, a step in the dark
A walk in the park, a trip in the dark
I'm getting away, escaping today
Today, today, today, today, today, today, today...Embed
