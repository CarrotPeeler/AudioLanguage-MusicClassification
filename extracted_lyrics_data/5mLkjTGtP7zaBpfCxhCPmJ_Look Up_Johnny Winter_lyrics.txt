Look up, look up
Get your eyes off the ground
Get your head in the sky
Things are going to get a whole lot better
And I'm telling you why
'Cause we're getting together
Things are coming together
You know our heads are together
My, oh my, oh my
Look up, look up
Look up, look up
I see a brand new world
See a brand new freedom, yeah
Things are going to get a whole lot brighter
Up in the sun
'Cause we're coming together
Yeah, our heads are together
Everybody together
My, oh my, oh my
Look up, look up there in the sky
See a  riding by
Surrounded by a play of all the things
Everybody knows the  name
