5 ContributorsNever Like This Before Lyrics
I've been kissed, loved, squeezed, and teased
But never like this before
You've got me tracking behind you, running, on my knees
Pleading and begging for more
I said I've heard a lot of sweet talk in my time
But your pretty words just mess up my mind

It's like never (Never)
Oh never (Never)
Oh never like this before

I've been swept, kept up all night
Sometimes I didn't rest at all
I've been shifted, lifted up sky high
And lost on a waterfall
I know sometimes it's easy, sometimes it's rough
I just can't ever seem to get enough

It's like never (Never)
Oh never (Never)
Oh never like this before
You might also like
Let me tell you about your love, baby
Heart shakin' now, baby
Mind wreckin' now, mama
Strong as a tree root
Sweet like canned soup
How do you do it
How do you do it
How do you do it
Do it to me baby?

I've been kissed, loved, squeezed, and teased
But never like this before
You've got me tracking behind you, running, on my knees
Pleading and begging for more
Sometimes you love me easy, then you love me rough
I just can't ever seem to get enough

It's like never (Never)
Oh never (Never)
Oh never (Never)
Oh never (Ever)
I said never (Never)
Oh never (Never)
Oh, never like this before

I never had it like this baby (Never)
Heart shakin' now baby (Never)
Mind wreckin' now, mama (Never)
I never had it so good baby (Mmm, never)
Your love, your love, baby (Mmm, never)
I never had it like this (Mmm, never)Embed
