39 ContributorsTemptation Lyrics
A heaven, a gateway, a hope
Just like a feeling I need, it's no joke
And though it hurts me to treat you this way
Betrayed by words I'd never heard, too hard to say

Oh, up, down, turn around
Please don't let me hit the ground
Tonight, I think I'll walk alone
I'll find my soul as I go home
Up, down, turn around
Please don't let me hit the ground
Tonight, I think I'll walk alone
I'll find my soul as I go home
Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh

Each way I turn, I know I'll always try
To break this circle that has been placed around me
From time to time, I find I've lost some need
That was so urgent to myself, I do believe

Oh, you've got green eyes, oh, you've got grey eyes
Oh, you've got blue eyes
Oh, you've got green eyes, oh, you've got blue eyes
Oh, you've got grey eyes
And I've never seen anyone quite like you before
No, I've never met anyone quite like you before

Up, down, turn around
Please don't let me hit the ground
Tonight, I think I'll walk alone
I'll find my soul as I go home
Up, down, turn around
Please don't let me hit the ground
Tonight, I think I'll walk alone
I'll find my soul as I go home

Oh, it's the last time, oh, it's the last time
Oh, it's the last time, oh, it's the last time
Oh, it's the last time
And I've never met anyone quite like you before
No, I've never met anyone quite like you before9Embed
