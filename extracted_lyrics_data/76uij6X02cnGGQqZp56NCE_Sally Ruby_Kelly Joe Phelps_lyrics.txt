2 ContributorsSally Ruby Lyrics
Sally ... what you doing here?
Sally ... what you doing here?

Left a jug among the reeds and corn
Big Jim bible with its pages torn
Tourniquet tight 'round my throwing arm
Jump in the briar

Ruby lays across the bed
You're coming home

Sally ... what you doing here?
Sally ... what you doing here?

Break a fire with a paper match
Burn a tattoo on a guy with an eye patch
Cut your name off my wooden leg
Drop it in the coal

Ruby lays across the bed
You're coming home
You might also like
Sally ... what you doing here?
Sally ... what you doing here?

Stroke the bottom of a sterno cup
Plywood hand-out going 'cross and up
Jack your coat against a backroom wall
Hand on a sleeve

Ruby lays across the bed
You're coming home


A bag of crows on the frontyard fence
Chicken-head walking stick paint no pretense
Cat knocked-out teeth can't chew on a bone
Gimp down the hole

Ruby lays across the bed
You're coming home
Sally ... what you doing here?
Sally ... what you doing here?

Hopped a mule with a rail-tie sack
"No brother", Jimmy says
"She ain't coming back"
Straw man the piney trading gum for wire
I waited a long time

Ruby lays across the bed
You're coming home

Sally ... what you doing here?
Sally ... what you doing here?Embed
