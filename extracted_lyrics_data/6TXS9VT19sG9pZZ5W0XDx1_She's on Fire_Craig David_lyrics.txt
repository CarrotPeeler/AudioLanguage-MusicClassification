Ohhh, Awww yeah
Told you before baby
Verse 1
She's hot, hot
This ain't your typical pretty
Sexy and witty
Smashin' it in every city
Cause (She's hot)
Bump up on it
Faces the lick
And she's know it, 'Cos she be looking (in this era)(She's hot)
Turn down anything you screwed
Ain't tryna be rude, dude
She's straight finger lickin' like soul food (She's hot)
So nonchalant
Ain't gotta front
Cos a (Coca Cola bottle shape ah it a run de place)
Back in the day the girl they always use to laugh at
Years of growin' up with people sayin' you're fat
Found it so hard felt so alone dealin' with that
Cryin' every night on sixteen
Whatcha say
Pics of a model and perfections made you hold back
Move in with guys be sayin' you ain't all that
Now they be wishin' they could get a piece of that
Lookin' hot for everyone to see

My girl be trippin' tryna sayin' her chest was so fat
Messin' with your head till you started believing that
Wouldn't stop until it hurt so deep, then one day
Like a genie in a bottle said don't worry 'bout this whole fad
