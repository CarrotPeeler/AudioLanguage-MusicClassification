1 ContributorBash The Bishop LyricsOh Yes!
The toll bridge was closed
South of the town
My kinsmen were barred
Even though I wore a crown
When I asked for a reason
We were told to be submit
T'was on the order of the bishop
Of Cicestransis
Extremely vexed were we
At this outrages affront
It crossed my mind the bishop
Was probably a c*nt
We rallied our men from pillaging
And plowing up the farms
Blast the trumpets loudly
A call to their arms
Bash the bishop
In his head
Bash, bash
Until he's dead
We stormed to the cathedral
But he was not to be found
A nun we spared the truncheon
Claimed he'd gone to ground
The earthly smell around us
Confirmed these words as true
I swore I'd throttle his little neck
Until his mitre be blue
We chased him to his cloisters
Where we found the host had fled
Leaving sixteen strappled strumpets
Weeping in his bed
The choir boy complained
About the "Pagan things" he'd done
We chased into the night
To finish what we'd begun
Bash the bishop
In his head
Bash, bash
Until he's dead
Bash!
Smash!
Crash!
Dash!
Bash!
Smash!
Crash!
Saddle up!
We finally caught the miscreant
By following the stench
He'd been living north of Saddlescoombe
Which a rather buxom wench
We pled for him
To take his punishment like a man
But instead he fled to Fulhingm
Sulken tears into his hand
Bash bash bash!
Bash bash bash!
Until he's deadYou might also likeEmbed
