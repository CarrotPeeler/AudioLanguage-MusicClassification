20 ContributorsSunshine Superman Lyrics
Sunshine came softly through my a-window today
Could've tripped out easy, but I've a-changed my way
It'll take time, I know it, but in a while
You're gonna be mine, and I know it, we'll do it in style

'Cause I made my mind up
You're goin' to be mine
I'll tell you right now
Any trick in the book and now baby
All that I can find

Everybody's hustlin' just to have a little scene
When I say we'll be cool, I think that you know what I mean
We stood on a beach at sunset, do you remember when?
I know a beach where, baby, a-it never ends

When you've made your mind up
Forever to be mine
Mm-mm-mm-mm
I'll pick up your hand and slowly
Blow your little mind
'Cause I made my mind up
You're going to be mine
I'll tell you right now
Any trick in the book, a-now, baby
All that I can find
You might also like

Superman or Green Lantern ain't got a-nothin' on me
I can make like a turtle and dive for your pearls in the sea, yep!
A-y-y-you can just sit there a-thinkin' on your velvet throne
About all the rainbows a-you can a-have for your own

When you've made your mind up
Forever to be mine
Mm-mm-mm-mm
I'll pick up your hand and slowly
Blow your little mind

When you've made your mind up
Forever to be mine
I'll pick up your hand
I'll pick up your hand8Embed
