There was a point when I was there where I didn't want to be
But I was there escaping from a place I've been before
I was myself, I was in me and from where I see and feel
I saw a man who was afraid of who he wished to be

Nighttime is taking longer
My hope will save me from despair
Dragging me out of hell

Hold on, the miracle of life
Will never be defined
Calm down, the minute you find love
You're facing the light

When I think I'm going deep, I'm really going hollow
I can see a newborn me emerging from the bottom
The two sides of my brain engage into a fight
For the right the left is wrong and for the left the left is right

The nightmare is growing stronger
My hope will save me from despair

Hold on, the miracle of life
Will never be defined
Calm down, the minute you find love
You're facing the light


Angels are calling out my name, I'm so afraid now
How can I know if I am sane or going mad?

Hold on, the miracle of life
Will never be defined
Calm down, the minute you find love
You're facing the light
You're facing the light
You're facing the lightEmbed
