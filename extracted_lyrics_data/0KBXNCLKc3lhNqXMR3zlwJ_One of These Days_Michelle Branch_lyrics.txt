1 ContributorOne of These Days Lyrics
I didn't notice
But I didn't care
I tried being honest
But that left me nowhere
I watched the station
Saw the bus pulling through
And I don't mind saying
A part of me left with you

So one of these days
I won't be afraid of staying with you
I hope and I pray
Waiting to find a way back to you
'Cause that's where I'm home, oh

Did I make you nervous?
Did I ask for too much?
Was I not deserving
One second of your touch?

So one of these days
I won't be afraid of staying with you
I hope and I pray
Waiting to find a way back to you
'Cause that's where I'm home, oh
You might also like
What would you do if I could have you?
Oh, if I could
I'd let you feel everything I'm thinking
Wouldn't that be nice?
Wouldn't that be nice?

And one of these days
I won't be afraid of staying with youEmbed
