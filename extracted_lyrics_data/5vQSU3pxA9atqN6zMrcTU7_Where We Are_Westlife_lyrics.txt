4 ContributorsWhere We Are Lyrics
Stay, stay where you are
Don't let me go, don't let me go
Made it this far
Oh baby, stop, stop right there
And don't walk away, don't walk away
Into thin air

We survived a crash
Made it through the wreckage
Standing here at last
So perfectly written

Now where we are
Is where we're supposed to be
Where we are
Keeps the breath in me
Where we've been
Risen from the deep
Where we're, no one can tear us apart
That's where we are

Don't, don't turn around
We gotta let, we got to let
Go of the past now
Oh, feel me by your side
We're out of danger
No reason to hide
You might also like
We survived the storm
Made it through the hurricane
Standing here at last
Dry despite the rain

And now where we are
Is where we're supposed to be
Where we are
Keeps the breath in me
Where we've been
We've risen from the deep
Where we're, no one can tear us apart
That's where we are
That's where we are

Stay, stay where you are

Where we are (Where we are)
Is where we're suppose to be
Where we are (Where we are)
Keeps the breath in me
And where we've been (Where we've been)
We've risen from the deep
Where we're, no one can tear us apart
That's where we are
That's where we areEmbed
