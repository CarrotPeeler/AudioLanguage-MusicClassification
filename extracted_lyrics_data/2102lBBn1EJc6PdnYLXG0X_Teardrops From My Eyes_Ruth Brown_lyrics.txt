4 ContributorsTeardrops From My Eyes LyricsEvery time it rains
I think of you
And that's the time
I feel so blue
When the rain starts to falling
My love comes tumbling down
And it's raining teardrops from my eyes
Well if you see clouds
Here in my eyes
It's just because
You said goodbye
Although the sun is shining
Theres no summer skies
Still it's raining teardrops from my eyes
Remember the night you told me
Our love would always be
I wouldn't be blue and lonely
Well if you'd come back to me
Every single cloud
Would disappear
I'd wear a smile
If you were here
You might also likeSo baby won't you hurry
Because I need you so
And it's raining teardrops
From my eyes
Remember the night you told me
Our love would always be
I wouldn't be blue and lonely
Well if you'd come back to me
Every single cloud
Would disappear
I'd wear a smile
If you were here
So baby won't you hurry
Cause I miss you so
And it's raining teardrops from my eyesEmbed
