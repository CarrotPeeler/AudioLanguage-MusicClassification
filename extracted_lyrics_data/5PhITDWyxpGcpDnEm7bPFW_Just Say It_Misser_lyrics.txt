Just say it
Honestly, honesty was never one of your strong traits
No, not with me
It's always lies and schemes, but it's not hard to believe
Deceit runs deep in family
Your apple didn't fall too far from the tree
Yeah, you know what I mean
What gets to me is when you tell me you're not sorry
You fucked me up enough for an apology at the least
Just stick to your generational dignity
I know you well enough to see through your vanity
I can read it on your lips
Just say it, just say it
Just say it, just say it
Just like when a tree falls and no one is around
When it hits the ground, does it even make a sound?
Is it the thought that still even really counts
When you can't even say it out loud?
Just like when a tree falls and no one is around
When it hits the ground, does it even make a sound?
