1 ContributorStrength to love LyricsTell these punk suckers
That my cherrie amour is
Off limits and that's to anyone
Who wants it
"Make my day" if you feeling important
Short temper can't remember where I lost it
That shit needs controlling
I know we've spoken
Over again about it but I am broken
Baby what you show me
Don't reassure me
It hurts for me to ask you to hold me
Ohhhhhhh!!!!!!
Why the fear?
While I am scared
While I am here and you are there
I am losing her
Strength to love
Oh give me strength
If you got love go hard on it
Its rough, its joke
You might also like...Better to have loved and lost than not at all...
If you got love go hard on it
Cuz it ain't always fun
...Better to have loved and lost than not at all...
Strength to love
Just give me patience, I am waiting
But don't take too long
If you are... What I am having after dinner
That means I am in the desert like a birthday stripper
Don't hurt me sister
I ain't here for the dick suck
I might be the one to pick
Your fatherless kids up
I'll fix up, your mistrust
Your in love mix up
'Til you see both sides of the coins
No tip cup
A hickie for your hiccups
A biggie for your Hip Hop
That's a symbol of love drummed down
With a rim shot
All this trouble we got
Got me bubbling hot
Make up sex, wake up next
And cuddle allot
Wasn't no big house
Wasn't no real spouse
Couldn't read the signs I became
Difficult
I am been trying work it out
For months on end
Lost a friend
Now I am in this bottle of gin
But you do what you do
And I'll do me
Now you know that you not destiny
Now you know that you can't have regrets
I am just saying, I know that you can do this shit to me...Embed
