All the things you can't say, soul brother
Understand you anyway
All the things you got to do, soul brother
I won’t blame you anyway

I know that you get a migraine (A migraine)
Waiting for another day (Another day)
Things won't get in your way (In your way)
Unless your skin won't burn anymore


I know that you get a migraine (A migraine)
Waiting for another day (Another day)
Things won’t get in your way (In your way)
Unless your skin won't burn anymore

Come on sing a melody, soul brother
Draw behind your melancholy
All the things you got to do, soul brother
I understand you anyway
You might also like
I know that you get a migraine (A migraine)
Waiting for another day (Another day)
Things won't get in your way (In your way)
Unless your skin won't burn anymore
I know that you get a migraine (A migraine)
Waiting for another day (Another day)
Things won't get in your way (In your way)
Unless your skin won't burn anymoreEmbed
