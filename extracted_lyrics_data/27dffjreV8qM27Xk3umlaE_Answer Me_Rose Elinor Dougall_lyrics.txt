4 ContributorsAnswer Me LyricsLately I've noticed something heavy on your heart
Do you remember in the beginning what led you to start?
Whenever I try to cross with your eye line
It's becoming much harder to find the focus of your gaze
Answer me, are we just killing time?
Cos it's easier not to try
Answer me, have we lost out this time?
You can keep running back but it's unavoidable
Will you surrender to the myriad questions asked of you?
You've drifted further
A hazy figure fading far from view
Camouflage yourself in excuses, tired lies
You're spending so much of your life looking over your shoulder
Answer me, are we just killing time?
Cos it's easier not to try
Answer me, have we lost all this time?
You can't keep running back but it's unavoidable
I'll be waiting for your reply
I'll be waiting for your reply
I'll be waiting for your reply
I'll be waiting for your replyYou might also likeEmbed
