Sleepwalker
Moontalker, tell me when you're dreaming
Tied down
Hold on to words till you are sleeping

Words you forget in the daylight
Words that you are speaking
Tied down by your dreams
Words that you are screaming

Cheap talker
Ten dollars, hear the words you're speaking
Tied down
Hold on to words till you are sleeping

Words you forget in the daylight
Words that you are speaking
Tied down by your dreams
Staring at the ceiling
Tied down by your dreams
Staring at the ceiling
Tied down by your dreamsYou might also like2Embed
