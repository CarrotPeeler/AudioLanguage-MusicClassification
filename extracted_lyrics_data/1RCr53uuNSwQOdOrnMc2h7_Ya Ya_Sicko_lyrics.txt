1 ContributorYa Ya LyricsI'm getting drunk on the summer shine
She's got the glow of gold in the summer of her eyes
There's something in the way that she looks at me
In books and written pages that I never thought I'd read
Now, after so much time, I see the sun
Oo-ooh, I was wrapped so tight
Now I'm undone
I'm undone
I'm undone
I'm undone
Seasons in the hills o'er the brandy-wine
Emptied me of thoughts that I thought I'd hide
Changing from the man that I used to be
In books and written pages that I never thought I'd read
Now, after so much time, I see the sun
Oo-ooh, I was wrapped so tight
Now I'm undone
I'm undone
I'm undone
I'm undoneYou might also likeEmbed
