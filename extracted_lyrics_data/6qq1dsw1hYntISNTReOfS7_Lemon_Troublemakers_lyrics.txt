2 ContributorsLemon LyricsEach second of my life
Will letting me in trouble
Don't let you can't let get you down
If you know that brother
Time after time
And day after day
I'm feeling more free
Each second there's a crime
At last the number
Life is not a game
You know that brother
I'm free
Like the music in my mind . . . I want to keep my soul
(Refrain)
I wanna be free
So once in my life . . . Free
So that I reach the sky . . . I wanna be free
Free like a bird . . . Free
Like the morning sun . . . I wanna be free
Free like my heart . . . Free
Like the moon at night . . . I wanna be free
Free like a dream . . . Free
Just once in my life . . . I wanna be free
Free like a child . . . Free
In my mother's heart . . . I wanna be free
And even if I don't know why . . . Free
I want you to turn left and right . . . I wanna be free
Free free free
Singing lalala . . . I wanna be free
So once in my life . . . Free
I wanna be free that soul

And down me
Where is lady day
I go like a stranger
But life is not Broadway
Oh â€¦ no compromise
From now and every day
Never leave my say
Hey bro . . . I want to keep my soul

Forget about your money
I want to keep my soul . . . my soul
Time after time
And day after day
I'm feeling more and more free . . . I want to keep my soul
Free . . . I want to keep my soul
Like Marvin Gay . . . I want to keep my soul
