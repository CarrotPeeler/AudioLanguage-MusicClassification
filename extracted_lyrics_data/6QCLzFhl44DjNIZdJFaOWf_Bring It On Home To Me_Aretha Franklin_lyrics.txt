If you ever change your mind
About leaving, about leaving me behind
Oh, oh, oh, bring it to me
Bring your sweet lovin'
Bring it on home to me, yeah, yeah

You know that I laughed
I laughed when you left
But oh, oh, baby, I know I only hurt myself, yes I did
Oh, oh, bring it to me
Bring your sweet lovin'
Bring it on home to me, on home to me

I'll give you every dollar, yeah
And a whole lot of money, too
But you blew it, baby, you didn't know
That ain't all I'll do for you, yeah
You oughta bring it to me
Get yourself together, come on home, baby
Come on give your lovin' to me, yeah, yeah
Come on home to me, yeah
Come on, come on home now
Yeah, come on home, home, baby

You, you, you, you, you, you, you, you don't know
That I'll always be your slave
Until they lay me down, and I'm buried in my grave, oh baby
You know you oughta come on home
You oughta come on home and bring
Bring it on back now, bring it on home to me
Mmm, bring it on home to me, yeah, I got it

You know I tried
I really tried to treat you right
But you thought more of your partners
You stayed out with and playing with all day and night
But I've got it
You know you oughta come on home, think about it
Come on home, bring it on home
They ain't got nothin' to give ya
Bring it on home to me, yeah
And bring it on home to me
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh yeah
And bring it on home to me
They can't help you, baby
You know you oughta bring it
Oh, oh, oh, home to me
Oh, yeah, you oughta bring it on home
Bring it on home to meEmbed
