2 ContributorsThe Game Lyrics
Frontin', that's how we're doin' it
Comin', best we believe when ain't it
Funny, got no integrity
Still, you wanna get with me? God bless celebrity
Frontin', that's how we're doin' it
Money, don't give a fuck and if ya
Love it, put your hands on the ceilin'
So damn appealing, let me know that you're feelin'

Call me another mothafucka with nothing to say
Proceeding with the mic, just in spite of the game
Figuring, I could string a couple words in a row
Throw a fuck or two in just to sure up the flow
So I got myself a pad like the one the rappers use
Wrote "rhyme book" on the cover, after that I got confused
Tech was really lame, lyrics outta time
'Nother thing that sucks about the game is all the rhymes
For inspiration called a copper friend of mine
Got myself a ki, did a couple a lines
All of a sudden I was murderin' the mic
Wouldn't know I'd never seen the ghetto in my life
Shit was illicit, I was pissin' in the rain
High and in the booth, born to play the game
But when you play the game you gotta play it for life
It's why strife needs fame, like fame needs strife
You might also like
Frontin', that's how we're doin' it
Comin', best we believe when ain't it
Funny, got no integrity
Still, you wanna get with me? God bless celebrity
Frontin', that's how we're doin' it
Money, don't give a fuck and if ya
Love it, put your hands on the ceilin'
So damn appealing, let me know that you're feelin'

So the sound was sewn up, just the image left to spark
Last time I checked the specs were well off the mark
The easy life had left me hanging, flabby and soft
Had to find the inner killer at whatever the cost
So I guinea-pigged experimental medical drugs
That sent me psycho 'nough to act like a thug
But the thug without the muscle ain't the means to the end
Phenomenal abdominals are like a thug's best friend
I hit the gym, said I was lookin' for tone
Trainer knew his shit and got the vet on the phone
Slipped me the script and then he showed me the crunch
He said "do a couple million 'fore the end of the month"
So I did just what he said but I got jack on the plan
'Sides the 'roids were doin' shit to my glands
Instead I sought the surgeon for a palpable fix
Saline solution in a packet of six
Despite the swelling they were gellin' for real
Spent a week in the solarium to sweeten the deal
I had the canvas, now I needed the art
"Thug a day" across the abs and you can make me a star, right?
Frontin', that's how we're doin' it
Comin', best we believe when ain't it
Funny, got no integrity
Still, you wanna get with me? God bless celebrity
Frontin', that's how we're doin' it
Money, don't give a fuck and if ya
Love it, put your hands on the ceilin'
So damn appealing, let me know that you're feelin'

The fame reigned down, 40 days, 40 nights
Like a ticker-tape parade, the paper fell from the sky
I watched it fall in a squall, completely mesmerised
It was fine, I was high, snowin' in July
Everything begins with paper, just like Missy used to say
Paper turns to rocks, rocks pave the way
But then the rocks get bigger and the rocks weigh you down
Had to cry myself a river, woulda drowned

But instead I used the ice to counter-weight while my ego expanded
Branded all the merch and praised god like he planned it
Had to hand it to me, mandatory life in the bling
I was real, I was down and gettin' paid like a pimp
Therefore, I was more than just the sum of my parts
Had to hire help to keep the lips away from my ass
Just like 'philis caught the Wilde, me I caught the fame
Now all you motherfuckers know my name, how's it go again?
Frontin', that's how we're doin' it
Comin', best we believe when ain't it
Funny, got no integrity
Still, you wanna get with me? God bless celebrity
Frontin', that's how we're doin' it
Money, don't give a fuck and if ya
Love it, put your hands on the ceilin'
So damn appealing, let me know that you're feelin'

Frontin', that's how we're doin' it
Comin', best we believe when ain't it
Funny, got no integrity
Still, you wanna get with me? God bless celebrity
Frontin', that's how we're doin' it
Money, don't give a fuck and if ya
Love it, put your hands on the ceilin'
So damn appealing, let me know that you're feelin'

Goin' fuck the rap game, rap game don't need me
You see this mic? This mic feeds me
Don't be afraid, have no fear
Truths come calling when I'm near
I said fuck the rap game, rap game don't need me
You see this mic? This mic feeds me
Don't be afraid, have no fear
Truths come calling when I'm nearEmbed
