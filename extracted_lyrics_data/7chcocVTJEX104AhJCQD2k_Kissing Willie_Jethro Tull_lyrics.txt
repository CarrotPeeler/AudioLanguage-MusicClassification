Breaking hearts in a market town
She eats filet of sole and washes it down with sparkling wine (Yeah)
Nice girl, but a bad girl's better
Qualifies in both ways to my mind
But now she's kissing Willie (Ooh-ooh!)
She shows a leg shows it damn well
Knows how to drive a man right back to being a child (Yeah)
Well, she's a nice girl, but her bad girl's better
I can read it in her cheating eyes and know that in a while
Well, she'll be kissing Willie
My best friend, Willie


Willie stands and Willie falls (Ooh!)
Willie hangs his head behind grey factory walls
Well, she's a nice girl, but her bad girl's better
Me and Willie just can't help come, when she calls (Ah-ah!)
Now she's kissing Willie
My best friend, Willie
