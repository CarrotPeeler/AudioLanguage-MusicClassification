11 ContributorsContinuum Lyrics
We set a drift in search of fact
It seems indeed, life is abstract
Several years with one faint sign
This last deft that holds no line

Making our way through time and space
Exploring all three to infinity
Suitcase is packed, flyin' free
Watching the stars align, you came over time
All the while sippin' on some hibiscus tea

In dark of night a hope would shine
For us to find when we arrive
A radiant light, the river's kind
Can get them now, but perhaps one time

Making our way through time and space
Exploring all three to infinity
Suitcase is packed, flyin' free
Watching the stars align, you came over time
All the while..
You might also likeMaking our way through time and space
Exploring all three to infinity
Suitcase is packed, flyin' free
Watching the stars align, you came over time
All the while..
Making our way through time and space
Exploring all three to infinity
Suitcase is packed, flyin' free
Watching the stars align, you came over time
All the while, sippin' on some hibiscus tea1Embed
