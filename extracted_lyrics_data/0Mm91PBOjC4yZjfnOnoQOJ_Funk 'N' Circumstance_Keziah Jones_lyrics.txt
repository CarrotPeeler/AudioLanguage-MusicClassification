1 ContributorFunk ‘n’ Circumstance LyricsOh, check me over
Get this feeling pulling me under
How can a country ask for more?
But I can't refuse
Everybody knows I got this hunger
Everybody goes along with the flake
Nobody knows why there's thunder
Nobody knows the rest of the cake
Oh brother
The skin you're in has got a new friend
Got a new language got a new trend
Oh brother
Now your hero's sitting in vogue
Got a new a language got a new logo
You just got to say :
Funk 'N' Circumstance
When the money talks the skin will dance
Any kind of funk will do
Play your circumstancial blues
Now let me get this straight
Is it the pot calling the kettle black?
Or the black calling the pot a what
A "nigga"? A "nigga"!

I got to realize another
She got this feeling for y'all to see
She started squeezing my history
Oh brother, sister
If you open your eyes you'll never see her
She took my flag and kissed my woe
She gave birth to all my sorrow
Oh brother
The skin you're in has got a new friend
Got a new language got a new trend
Oh mother
Now your son is sitting in jail
Got a new a language got a new logo
You just got to say :
Funk 'N' Circumstance
When the money talks the skin will dance
Any kind of funk will do
Play your circumstancial blues
"My country 'tis of thee..."
Brother, sisterEmbed
