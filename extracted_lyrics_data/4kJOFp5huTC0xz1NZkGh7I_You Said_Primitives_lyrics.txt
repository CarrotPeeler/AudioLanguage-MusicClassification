1 ContributorYou Said LyricsYou said you loved me
All the while
You said our love would always
Be in style
Thought I was dreaming
I was wrong
I love you baby
But your love's not strong
'Cause I love you baby
You drive me crazy
I love you baby but you ain't no use to me
You said you loved me
All the while
You said our love would
Be in style
Thought I was dreaming
I was wrong
I love you baby
But your love's not strong
'Cause I love you baby
Well you drive me crazy
Well I love you baby but you ain't no use to me
You said you loved me
All the while
You said our love would always
Be in style
Thought I was dreaming
I was wrong
I love you child
But your love's not strong
'Cause I love you baby
Well you drive me crazy
Well I love you baby but you ain't no use to me
I love you baby
Well you drive me crazy
Well I love you baby but you ain't no use to meYou might also likeEmbed
