3 ContributorsBloody Lip LyricsMiss too much, to come back now
Too much now, I let you down
I was here before, didn't know how
Waited too long, now it's gone
Maybe I'm not ready for anything else
Maybe you were ready before you had left here
Old arms swinging for me now
What you had you broke
There has never been
And there, there will never be
There will never be
There has never been
And there, there will never be
There will never be
Too much now, moved around
Was it here before? I didn't know how
Waited too long, now it's gone
Maybe I know, maybe I don't
Maybe I'm not ready for anything else
Maybe you were ready before you had left here
Old arms swinging for me now
What you had you broke
There has never been
And there, there will never be
There will never be
There has never been
And there, there will never be
There will never beYou might also likeEmbed
