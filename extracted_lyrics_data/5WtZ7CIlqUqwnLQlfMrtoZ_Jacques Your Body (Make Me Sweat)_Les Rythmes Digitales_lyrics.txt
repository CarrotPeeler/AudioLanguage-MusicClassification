3 ContributorsJacques Your Body (Make Me Sweat) LyricsA friend in need is a friend indeed
A friend with weed is better
A friend with breasts and all the rest
A friend who is dressed in leather
A friend in need is a friend indeed
A friend who'll tease is better
Our thoughts compressed which makes us blessed
And makes for stormy weather
A friend in need is a friend indeed
My Japanese is better
And when she is pressed she will undress
And then she is boxing clever
A friend in need is a friend indeed
A friend who bleeds is better
My friend confessed, she passed the test
And we will never sever
Day is dawning, skin's crawling
Day is dawning, skin's crawling
Day is dawning, skin's crawling
Day is dawning, skin's crawling
Pure morning, pure morning
Pure morning, pure morning
A friend in need is a friend indeed
A friend who'll tease is better
Our thoughts compressed which makes us blessed
And makes for stormy weather
A friend in need is a friend indeed
A friend who bleeds is better
My friend confessed she passed the test
And we will never sever
Day is dawning, skin's crawling
Day is dawning, skin's crawling
Day is dawning, skin's crawling
Day is dawning, skin's crawling
Pure morning, pure morning
Pure morning, pure morning
Pure morning, pure morning
Pure morning, pure morning
A friend in need is a friend indeed
My Japanese is better
And when she is pressed she will undress
And then she is boxing clever
A friend in need is a friend indeed
A friend with weed is better
A friend with breasts and all the rest
A friend who is dressed in leatherYou might also likeEmbed
