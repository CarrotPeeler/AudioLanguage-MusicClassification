7 ContributorsI Tamper With the Evidence at the Murder Site of Odin Lyrics
You investigate the murders
At the gates of gods
I tamper with the evidence
At Odin's murder site
I can swim through time
I can't be killed, I have no way to die
You will hunt through life
The physics of this world can't stop my crime

Draw your sword
I'll meet you at the battle rock

Space will see me through
I can't be killed, I have no way to die
Spheres within this range will be my path
My energy ignites

Parasite
Ultra-violent porthole
Fasten straps
Helmet frigid wormhole
You might also likeDeth in you, deja vu
Mammoth view, time will twist your soul
You spin, your blood goes thin
Your marrow burns, your veins begin to burst
The speed, it hurts and hurts
And strains your brain as you spin forth, through time
You meet yourself for one, brief moment
In an eclipse and watch you die
Your guts explode as your erode
You broke the code, the riddle's solved
You made the trip, you have evolved
You're the eclipse, you are a godEmbed
