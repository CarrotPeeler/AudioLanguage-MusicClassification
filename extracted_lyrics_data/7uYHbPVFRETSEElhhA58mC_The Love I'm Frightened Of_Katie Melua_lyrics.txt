3 ContributorsThe Love I’m Frightened Of LyricsIf I wait
Don’t move a muscle
Maybe somehow a spark will strike
It’s been a long night
So sincere
But the message is still a struggle
Knives with which we juggle
While we jump through fire
So maybe I’ll move on and make a mistake
And see if my earth-quakes

This is the love I’m frightened of
Doesn’t come with a leaflet that says how to keep it
This is the love that can’t be seen
No detailed instructions or Japanese symbols
Like you find on a washing machine
Slow me down
Apply some gentile pressure
And maybe somehow a spark will strike
I hope it might
One is best
But lacking in conversation
Safe but no relation
To the warmth you give

And see if my earth-quakes

This is the love I’m frightened of
Doesn’t come with a leaflet that says how to keep it
This is the love that can’t be seen
No detailed instructions or Japanese symbols
Like you find on a washing machine
This is the love I’m frightened of
Doesn’t come with a leaflet that says how to keep it
This is the love that can’t be seen
No detailed instructions…
This is the love I’m frightened of
This is the love I’m frightened ofEmbed
