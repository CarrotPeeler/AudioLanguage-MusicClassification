3 ContributorsHeat Night LyricsStop!
Damn, reverse the wires, switch the ground!
Something's crazy here, we're twisted around
What got into us anyway?
Who threw the rules away?
Who tore the boundaries down?
Suddenly I- shy girl is seamless smooth
Laugh with the she-bitch at this grand cartoon
Everything's inside out and turned around
Bite that bad Bourbon down
What spirits healed these wounds up?
Heat night, make it a heat night
Heat night, height of the rut, heat night!
Heat lightning, no cut
Pure rabid mutiny
The enemy is
I rule this thunderhouse of rouge and ruin
Are all my sister's secret fevermoons (She thinks)
We'll make it easy for them tonight
We'll make it easy tonight
What planet rules these tides?
You might also likeRiding a longshot night in overdrive
Novels flashing, advertising eyes
Got nothing to say after the jukebox stops?
Who cares we're all on top?
Why waste your breath on lies? Don't lie!
Heat night, make it a heat night
Heat night, height of the rut, heat night!
Heat lightning, no cut
Pure rabid mutiny
The enemy is
Heat night!
Heat night! (Heat night)
Heat night! (Heat night! Heat night!)Embed
