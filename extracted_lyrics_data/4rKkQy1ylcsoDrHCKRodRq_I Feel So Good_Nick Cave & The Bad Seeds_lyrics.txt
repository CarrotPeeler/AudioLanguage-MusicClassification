Well I feel so good I don't know what to do
Yeah I feel so good I don't know what to do
Well I feel so good I feel like I wanna play with you

I feel so good I feel like banging my box
I feel so good I feel like banging my box
Well if I had me one more shot I believe I'd blow my natural top
Oh yeah!

Oh yeah!
Oh yeah!
Oh yeah!
Oh yeah!
Oh yeah!
Well I feel so good

I'm so glad I know what's on your mind
I'm so glad I know what's on your mind
I'm so glad I know what's on your mind
I'm so glad I know what's on your mind
I'm so glad, glad, glad, glad, glad I know what's on your mind
