Hop out the coupe with the Audemar Skelly
I told that bitch, "Eat me up like a deli"
She off the drugs, yeah, she love psychedelics
I'm in the AMG speedin' with  (Huh)
We're ready, I told that bitch, "Bounce like a Betty" (Huh, huh)
And I'm gettin' three hoes at the telly (Huh, huh)
And that bitch wanna blow out my celly (Huh, huh)
She take off her clothes like I'm playin' some Nelly
I'm mixin' Chanelly, I put on 
I top off with new Helmut Lang (Lang)
Niggas, they askin' for hand
I swear they really be weird, they really be lame (Lame)
You can go ask all my brothers, and they finna tell you that I never change (Change)
I just might get big body Urus, I might get Durango, I might get the Range (Range)

I pop a X, and I won't feel the same (Same)
Nike check backed up, I feel like I'm Bane (Bane)
I'm finna make me some hunnids
I'm breadin' my chicken, I'm feelin' like I'm eatin' at KFC (C)
Like go get your money up (Money up)
You're bussin', you tryna be funny, huh (Funny, huh)
Bitch, I'm on my grind like I'm Tony Hawk (Tony Hawk)
Yeah, shawty she eat me like Benihana (Benihana)
