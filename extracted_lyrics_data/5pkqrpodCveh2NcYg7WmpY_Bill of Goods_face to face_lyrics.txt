2 ContributorsBill of Goods Lyrics
Try to convince you that you can't live without one (whoa)
Hey, look around man, everybody's got one (whoa)
So hurry up, get your dollar bills together (whoa)
They're going to try and get you something even better (whoa)

You're not so sure, but you heard it's great (you heard it's great)
You get there first so you won't be late (you won't be late)
Everybody else will have to wait in line

I overestimated you
You knew that I probably would
We're so predictable
And we've been sold a bill of goods, a bill of goods

You want a choice, want to make your own decisions (whoa)
You want to make up the rules and the provisions (whoa)

And everything is going to be so great (be so great)
When you're the latest keeper at the gate (at the gate)
Everybody else will have to wait in line
You might also like
I overestimated you
You knew that I probably would
We're so predictable
And we've been sold a bill of goods, a bill of goods

I overestimated you
You knew that I probably would
We're so predictable
And we've been sold a bill of goods
I overestimated you
You knew that I probably would
We're so predictable
And we've been sold a bill of goods, a bill of goods

Try to convince you that you can't live without one (whoa)
Hey, look around man, everybody's got one (whoa)
So hurry up, get your dollar bills together (whoa)
They're going to try and get you something even better (whoa)Embed
