Back again with a quickness
Pick it up, pick it up
Master arithmetic-ness
Light it up, light it up
I got the heat in both feets
Snake handler's hands
Come back with slickness
And do it all again, yeah

My subtle hustle
Smooth as mother's butter
I let it ride on
I let it ride on
My subtle hustle
Smooth as mother's butter
I let it ride on
I let it ride on

Now I'm the media darling
Pick it up, pick it up
An international phenomenon
Light it up, light it up
(Sing it again) I cause eclipses
(One more time) With a wave of the hand
(Sing it again) Let 'em hang in ellipses
(One more time) And do it all again, yeah

Smooth as mother's butter
I let it ride on
I let it ride on
My subtle hustle
Smooth as mother's butter
I let it ride on
I let it ride on


I got your number
I steal your thunder
I got your mother's maiden name
Tattooed on my arm
I got your number
I steal your thunder
I got your mother's maiden name
Tattooed on my arm

I drive out demons
Can I hear an amen?
Lay hands on screaming heathens
And do it all again, yeah
My subtle hustle
Smooth as mother's butter
I let it ride on
I let it ride on
My subtle hustle
Smooth as mother's butter
I let it ride on
I let it ride on

Let it ride on
Let it ride on
Let it ride on
Let it ride onEmbed
