2 ContributorsMaking of ‘Cry for the Moon’ LyricsThis is the pre-production for "Cry for the Moon", as we recorded it at my place before entering the Excess Studio to record it as a demo track
As you can hear, it contains drums (which I then played on my synthesizer), guitars and synthesizer, and this last one has a funny story to it
Since we only had two days in the studio, we wanted to use all the time we had as efficient as possible, so we came up with the idea of recording all the synthesizer tracks as MIDI tracks on my computer before entering the studio, so we would only have to transfer that to the recording computer at the studio
Okay now, here's the funny thing. Due to some exams, I wasn't able to be present during the mixing process, so when transferring these tracks to the studio recording computer, Coen and Mark, they thought it would be better if they used Mark's synthesizer for that, probably because it had more keys, but this means that all the work I had with editing, programming and finding the right sounds was just useless, because all the tracks were edited specifically to the sounds on my synthesizer and, well, not to Mark's. I do have to admit that back then, I wasn't too pleased with this, but looking back at it now, I can have a laugh out of it as wellSee Epica LiveGet tickets as low as $49You might also likeEmbed
