8 Contributors’Bout It Lyrics
Nothing's easy when it comes to life
But that's how it goes, everything that you want comes with a price
Silver and gold

Said, now I am gonna wait for you
It's the right time to run away with you

You and I can talk about it every night
But no one's gonna know unless you're doin' it right
Cause it really doesn't matter if it's black or it's white
No one's gonna know unless you're doin' it right
You and I can talk about it every night
But no one's gonna know unless you're doin' it right
Cause it really doesn't matter if it's black or it's white
No one's gonna know unless you're doin' it right

I'm 'bout it, you're 'bout it
Say I'm 'bout it, you're 'bout it
Say I'm 'bout it, you're 'bout it
I'm 'bout it, you're 'bout it

People change if you just give them time
Everyone grows, there's some things you won't know until you die

Said, now I am gonna wait for you
It's the right time to run away with you

You and I can talk about it every night
But no one's gonna know unless you're doin' it right
Cause it really doesn't matter if it's black or it's white
No one's gonna know unless you're doin' it right
You and I can talk about it every night
But no one's gonna know unless you're doin' it right
Cause it really doesn't matter if it's black or it's white
No one's gonna know unless you're doin' it right

I'm 'bout it, you're 'bout it
Say I'm 'bout it, you're 'bout it
Say I'm 'bout it, you're 'bout it
I'm 'bout it, you're 'bout it

Non, ça ne corrige pas le mal, malgré ce que tu penses
On se rapproche de la lumière, mais elle est toujours si loin
Ma solitude m'entoure, si serrée, j'espère que ça changera mon monde
Le bonheur est froid, la nuit, mais c'est si bon3Embed
