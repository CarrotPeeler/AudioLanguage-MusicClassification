3 ContributorsLove Games LyricsAfter knowing you so long
I can't believe what's going on
It's kinda strange to hear you say
How much you love me
'Cause when you were only nine
And I was ten
We had such fun, babe, playing lovers
You were never more than just
The kid next door
And now you've grown
I wanna play some moreâ€¦
Love games
But no more kiss-and-run games, this time
You used to be a shy girl
But my girl, look what a year or two has done for you
We'll play love games
Forever kind of love games, this time
From now on, when I hold you
You can't go to Mama 'til Mama calls
When I take you out on a Friday night
I know my friends won't recognise you
Who would ever dream that you'd
Turn out this way?
