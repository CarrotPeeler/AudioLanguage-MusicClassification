Down from the mountain so high
I'm driving my blue car baby
Down from the mountain so high
I'm driving my blue car baby
Coming down gonna say goodbye
The sunrise is a miracle
But it can't hold a candle to you
Uh huh the sunrise is a miracle
But it can't hold a candle to you
Do you remember them rides in my blue car
Back when it was brand new
Well it's a good old car
But the clutch is a little loose
And the brakes are screaming
A song called 'what's the use'
But it's good for one more trip
One more trip to you
You know the lightning's meant to strike
The tall pine trees
And the birds are meant to cry
And wheel in the breeze
But some things baby
I guess they just ain't meant to be
When I get back up on the mountain
I'll close my door against the wind
When I get back up on the mountain
I'll close my door against the wind
I'll park my old blue car
I might fall down the mountain
But I will never fall in love again
I'm driving my blue car baby
Down from the mountain so high
I'm driving my blue car baby
Down from the mountain so high
I'm driving my blue car baby
Coming down gonna say goodbye
Gonna say goodbyeYou might also likeEmbed
