3 ContributorsStreaks of Blood LyricsChrist
The suffering and misery that I endure
To harbor thoughts so bizarre
Beyond impure
Mother, I'm here
To do all the things
That you long for me to do
I love when we're in our reside
Alone late at night
And you embrace me
Now you found another
To do all the things
That we used to do at night
In our room
Now I experience sexual neglect
At ten years old
Now your life means nothing to me
After all the pain you caused me
Just to see you with another guy
I guess I'm the "only one" was just a lie
See Dying Fetus LiveGet tickets as low as $48You might also likeI confront you with sexual frustration
Built up inside of me
But you deny the pleasure
You'll now die in vain
The suffering and misery that I endure
To see your streaks of blood
Still run down the wall
You can now not leave me
But your death was not in vain
Even though your body's cold
I can still enjoy you in death
