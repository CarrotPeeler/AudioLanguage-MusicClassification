2 ContributorsExplain Myself? Lyrics
Like a watchdog standin' at the fence
Beggin' for the next person to pass and test his patience
Hammer back, cocked, and ready to go off
Lookin' for any volunteers that wanna crawl and cough
Stands up front when it's time to take
A maybe situation to a definite shake-it-up
Battle me, you're gonna see everything go red
You bother me with your Grand Inquisition

I won't, and I shouldn't have to
Why should I (Explain myself to you?)
I won't, and I shouldn't have to
Why should I (Explain myself?)

Ooh, you're gettin' too close to the animal
The one you're gonna turn into a cannibal
I'm not holdin' anything back
So you better be holdin' if I start to attack
Rack a body all scarred from the battles before
But, I call 'em my "monetary marks of war."
You see, battle started with or without any kinda warnin'
I knew that it was comin', did nothin' about it

I won't, and I shouldn't have to
Why should I (Explain myself to you?)
I won't, and I shouldn't have to
Why should I (Explain myself to you?)
I won't, and I shouldn't have to
Why should I (Explain myself to you?)
I won't, and I shouldn't have to
Why should I (Explain myself to you?)

Oh, to you
To you, to you, to you…


Take it easy, you're goin' too far
Don't wanna keep this car in the red
You don't wanna start what you just can't end
By just pretendin' that you ain't gonna bend
Instead, you're lookin' right into the eyes of a savage
Ready to pillage, loot, and ravage
You never seen anything act like this
Or react the second you end up on the list
You end up on the list
You end up on the list
You end up on the list
You end up on the list
I won't, and I shouldn't have to
Why should I (Explain myself to you?)
I won't, and I shouldn't have to
Why should I (Explain myself to you?)
I won't, and I shouldn't have to
Why should I (Explain myself to you?)
I won't, and I shouldn't have to
Why should I (Explain myself to you?)

Oh, to you…
To you, to you…
Oh, to you
To you
To you
To you
To you
To you
To you
To youEmbed
