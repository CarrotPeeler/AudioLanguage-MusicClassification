5 ContributorsTough Enough LyricsBaby only the strong will survive
All the mysteries of life
Only fantasy keeps you away
In the lonely fields of those broken shields
So keep on kicking
The bomb is ticking
Don't stop, don't be a runaway
Go for the fire
Baby are you tough enough
Just keep on living
And don't start giving
The devil good reason
To get you in the seasons of heartbreak
Baby are you tough enough
Baby are you tough enough
Yeah my skin is a dangerous place
Never trust my smiling face
With a touch I can change all your dreams
And my kiss can wake
Feelings you can't take
Baby are you tough enough
Baby are you tough enough
You might also likeI will meet you there
Coz I need you there
Oh tonight
Baby are you tough enough
Baby are you tough enoughEmbed
