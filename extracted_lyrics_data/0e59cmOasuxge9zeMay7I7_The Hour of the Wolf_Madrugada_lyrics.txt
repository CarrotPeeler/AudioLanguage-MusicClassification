Twenty thousand knives at the gates
The fire has come to you and it won't wait

When the wolf arrives
From a mountain pass
On a night of shattered glass
Can you break him down?
Can you shake him down?
Will you leave him lying cold?

You gotta run to the ones that made you
Fall so deep into the valley below
You gotta pray they will never betray you
Never let you go
Never let you go
Never let you go
Never let you go

You look like a man undone by all that fire in your soul
I can see you, I can hear you, I can't speak to you at all

When the wolf arrives
From a mountain pass
On a night of shattered glass
Can you shake him down?
Can you break him down?
Will you leave him lying cold?
You might also like
You gotta run to the ones that made you
Fall so deep into the valley below
You gotta pray they will never betray you
Never let you go
Never let you go
Never let you go
Never let you go


You gotta run to the ones that made you
Fall so deep into the valley below
You gotta pray they will never betray you
Never let you go, Never let you go
Never let you go, Never let you go
You gotta run to the ones that made you
Fall so deep into the valley below
You gotta pray they will never betray you
Never let you go, Never let you go
Never let you go, Never let you go
You gotta run to the ones that made you
Fall so deep into the valley below
You gotta pray they will never betray you
Never let you go
Never let you goEmbed
