1 ContributorYellow Wood LyricsShow me back to the path
Where the ground has split in half
Like the claws of a cloven hoof
Where the shelves have shifted fast
Raising highways for the lost
Explorers, searching for truth
Fault lines disappear
Now the hanging wall is here
Imposing it's varved clay beak
A wishbone pulled apart
By a child in the dark
Who's hoping for the larger tusk
Take my hand, lead me south
To the maw, that gaping mouth
From where the dumb mud drips
These dreams may be too late
But return me to the wake
And into the stream, I'll slip
But greed for greener grass
Lures me cruelly to the past
Like a siren calling from the rock
Left stranded in a vale
It's lonely in the shade
That wicked memory makes
You might also likeSo come find me, in a yellow wood
I'll be waiting, in a yellow wood
You and I, in a yellow wood
All alone, in a yellow wood
(If you ride to the right, you will lose you head)
(If you ride to the left, you will lose your horse)Embed
