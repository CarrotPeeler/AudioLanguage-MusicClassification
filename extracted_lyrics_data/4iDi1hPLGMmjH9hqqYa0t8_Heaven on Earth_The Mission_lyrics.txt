3 ContributorsHeaven On Earth LyricsEver
There's oceans between us
Take to the sea, take to the sea
There's heaven before us
Float on the waves, float on the waves
Pale moon lay belief on me
Mother come give me birth
You give me heaven
And I'll promise you the earth
Heaven
Lays on your pillow
Sleep in your eyes, sleep in your eyes
Lays in the waiting
Steal every moment, hold every breath
Gentle heart beat as one
Dream for the beauty of birth
You give me heaven
And I'll promise you the earth
I'll die for you, if the time ever came
I'll kill for you and shoulder the blame
I'd cry for you and never feel shame
For the child is within
For the child is within you
You might also likePrecious
I want the earth for you
Precious
I hold out my hands to touch the sky
And only the pure go to heaven
Suffer the child unto you
Forever more
Heaven on earth
Bless me my goddess of love
For all your blessing is worth
You give me heaven and I promise you the earth
I pray for the second coming
Worship you for the first
You give me heaven and I give you the earth
You give me heaven and I give you the earth
You gave me heaven and I give you the earthEmbed
