2 ContributorsThey Bite (Anymore) LyricsIt's not that i feel betrayed
By the things that have been said
It's just that i pick the wrong people
To call my friends
But the one thing i never expected
Was something like this from you
Now i will cut you out of my life
The way you always do
And i will miss your smile
And i will miss your face
And i will miss you around
But things can't be the same
And i have so many questions
That i'd like to ask of you
I would like some answers
I think that's the least you could do
The one thing that i can't understand
Is how you would want to believe
All those vicious rumours
When you know my personalityYou might also likeEmbed
