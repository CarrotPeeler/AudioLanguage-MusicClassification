3 ContributorsEasy Rider Blues Lyrics
Now tell me where my easy rider's gone
Tell me where my easy rider's gone
My  woman always in the wrong

Your easy rider died on the road
Man, your easy rider died on the road
I'm poor boy here and ain't got nowhere to go

"Soon's gonna be the time that a woman don't need no man
Well it soon will be the time a woman don't need no man"
Said "Baby, shut your mouth and don't be raisin' sand"

The train I ride don't burn no coal at all
Train I ride don't burn no coal at all
The coal I'm burning, it won't burn except for Cannonball

I went to the depot
I mean I went to the depot, sat my suitcase down
The blues overtake me and tears come rollin' down

The woman I love, she must be out of town
Woman I love, man, she's out of town
She left me this mornin' with her face in a terrible frown
You might also like
I got a girl 'cross town, she crochets all the time
I got a girl 'cross town, crochet all the time
Sugar, you don't quit crocheting, you gonna lose your mind

Said fair brown, what's the matter now?
Said fair brown, what's the matter now?
You're tryin' your best to quit me, woman, and you don't know howEmbed
