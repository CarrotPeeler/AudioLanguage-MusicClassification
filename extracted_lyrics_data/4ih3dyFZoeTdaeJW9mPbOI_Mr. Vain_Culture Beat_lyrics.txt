17 ContributorsMr. Vain Lyrics
(Yeah)

Call him Mr. Raider, call him Mr. Wrong
Call him Mr. Vain
Call him Mr. Raider, call him Mr. Wrong
Call him insane

He'd say, "I know what I want and I want it now
I want you, 'cause I'm Mr. Vain
I know what I want and I want it now
I want you, 'cause I'm Mr. Vain"

Call me raider, call me wrong
Call me insane, call me Mr. Vain
Call me what you like, as long as you call me time and again
Feel the presence of the aura of the man
None to compare
Loveless dying for a chance just to touch a hand or a moment to share
Can't deny the urge that makes them want to lose themselves to the debonaire one
Hold me back, the simple fact is that I'm all bad and I'm always there
Want sex? You can't perplex me, now you know who's raw
As if you didn't know before
I know what I want and I want it now
I want you and then I want a little more
You might also like
Call him Mr. Raider, call him Mr. Wrong
Call him Mr. Vain
Call him Mr. Raider, call him Mr. Wrong
Call him insane

He'd say, "I know what I want and I want it now
I want you, 'cause I'm Mr. Vain
I know what I want and I want it now
I want you, 'cause I'm Mr. Vain"

Mr. Wrong
Mr. Wrong
Mr. Raider
Wrong

Girls all over the world, they hope and pray and die for men like me
'Cause I'm the one begotten son that breaks the mold, get a look at male epitome
Style has never seen that makes you want to grab and hold and squeeze real tight
Who's gonna be the one to save you from yourself if you wanna take a bite?
Please, oh baby, please, you beg, you want, you say you got to get some
Caught up in the charm that I laid on thick, and now there's nowhere to run
Just another fish that bit the worm on the hook of my line
Yeah, I keep many females longin' for a chance to win my heart with S-E-X and plenty
Call him Mr. Raider, call him Mr. Wrong
Call him Mr. Vain
Call him Mr. Raider, call him Mr. Wrong
Call him insane

He'd say, "I know what I want and I want it now
I want you, 'cause I'm Mr. Vain
I know what I want and I want it now
I want you, 'cause I'm Mr. Vain"


Call him Mr. Raider, call him Mr. Wrong
Call him Mr. Vain
Call him Mr. Raider, call him Mr. Wrong
Call him insane

He'd say, "I know what I want and I want it now
I want you, 'cause I'm Mr. Vain
I know what I want and I want it now
I want you, 'cause I'm Mr. Vain"
Call him Mr. Raider, call him Mr. Wrong
Call him Mr. Vain
Call him Mr. Raider, call him Mr. Wrong
Call him insane

He'd say, "I know what I want and I want it now
I want you, 'cause I'm Mr. Vain
I know what I want and I want it now
I want you, 'cause I'm Mr. Vain
I know what I want and I want it now
I want you, 'cause I'm Mr. Vain
I know what I want and I want it now
I want you, 'cause I'm Mr. Vain"2Embed
