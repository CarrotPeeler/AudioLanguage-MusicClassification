Good practice makes permanent
Good practice makes permanent
Good practice makes permanent
All sons and sisters are on their own
Brothers, blisters, leave when they're done
I win, you win, wherever you've gone
All sons...
I am what you want to be like
They had imagined of me
You are so beautiful to me
You are so wonderful to me
Good practice makes it permanent
Good permanent makes good practice
At living like them, but they're all...
I am what you want to be like
They had imagined of meYou might also likeEmbed
