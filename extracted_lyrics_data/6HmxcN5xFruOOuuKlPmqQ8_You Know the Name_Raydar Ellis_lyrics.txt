37 ContributorsAirplanes (Freestyle) Lyrics
Since '99 I've been dope in this, focusing, unfocusing
Sure as the sun floats, as sure as the sun's smoking
I was the gun-toting-est, my cuz told me
"Don't get demoted, keep it close to your digits
You know you get it, you let yourself get too close to them chickens"
I said, "I disagree," then I let Superhead lick on me
Stroking the kitten of Kat Stacks
'Bout to turn around and write a book about both of them bitches
Next stop, to the top, I done went from A to X-Y
Almost at Z, chilling at a rest stop
My new bitch, call her my PS3â€”you?
Your bitch pussy, call it my Xbox
Me, I'm the rhyme ruler
Me and Denaun together deadly as Nas in his prime
You 'bout deadly as a benign tumor
Since '92, been a highly touted, retarded truth
Prolly 'bout to Eli Porter-potty somebody booth
Never sellin' my soul, I'm sellin' my skills
I'm on rap's radar now, Elliott Wilson
Painter of the underground canvas
Even though I can't freelance no more, the underground's famished
Before I settle for less than average, I'll swallow a watermelon
Follow it with a Double-Down sandwich
I swear that God told me
Slaughterhouse would be the second time around for me
All eyes on me! I know I'm not the greatest, I go hard
Your boombox is now invaded, Bogart, haha!
Look at me today, eight years ago
I was popular for being hated, Solar!
Nickel Nine's the ruler, God combined with Buddha
Gifted oblongata, prized medulla
Each line's like a computer bomb designed by MacGyver
That only can be detonated by MacGruber
I'm thinking if I ain't binge-drinking, then I ain't living
Somebody told me I'm prolly dying, but I ain't listen
By the time it could harm me, I'll prolly die by a trigger
So I'm only going cold turkey right after Thanksgiving
I paint pictures between blank scriptures
Now, just how contradictory is it that I pray?
The name's Royce and I be poppin' so much pussy
Dwight Howard look at me sideways
And while the bitches try to grab all on my dick
I can't even get my own nigga to rap on my shit
You form a clique, it should be sacred, I shouldn't say shit
'Cause the truth hurts, like the bitch that Dre ditched
Nobody loves my niggas like me
Sober or wasted, for you, there's no replacement
I swear that God told me
Slaughterhouse would be the second time around for me
All eyes on me!You might also like4Embed
