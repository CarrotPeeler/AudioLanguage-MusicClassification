We like a nigga straight outta jail, give me the money nigga
I'll smack you stupid, ain't nuttin' funny nigga
I'll lay a nigga out and use they ass to shoot like a marble black floor
Bloody somethin' like a hacksaw
And then we stash a couple gats in the bag because we at war
And pistol whip some of these niggas, leavin' 'em wit' cracked jaws
Battlin' like we in Kosovo, niggas see you supposed to know
We extremely serious niggas
You see it's so marvelous how we just stack more, pack more
No chichi niggas allowed, just throw 'em out the back door
This new menace got a wicked flow like pro tennis
Y'all niggas soft like limp dick and need progenes
Blessin' the younger thug with shit to look forward to
The god is back, so niggas is quicker to fast forward you
Yo, this shit be straight energy
You ain't fuckin' wit' Flipmode, nigga
While I'm refreshin' your memory (Come on!)

Now, see it's hectic, respect it
Blow up your deck until my cassette is ejected
How I will beat you just like your father, don't even bother
However nigga, whatever nigga, who wanna follow?
It gets coarse like the callous of a strugglin' black foot under privilege
I'm quick to stick you for your whole bank book
Bitches follow my bounce and follow my flow
Follow me now, follow me later, follow my glow, ayo
Follow instructions and follow the pro
And to follow my magic, bitches wanna follow my dough
Keepin' ya bouncin', got all my people singin' the hook
Got bitches buggin' like how niggas be wild in the Brook'
Look, we street niggas, while you live by the book
Funny nigga, ain't no need to shoot yourself in the foot
Fuck wit' bitches that's gettin' dough and they know how to cook
In every struggle, I always did whatever it took!
So all my niggas!
