And that's harder to face over the deep end
It gets harder to sense - she wanted to go home
Game over she said, "Are you receiving?"
The time that we spent has been deceiving
So we're parting our ways with no regrets tonight
Because I've been doing fine
So please don't leave me
I've been ill advised
So stop wasting all your time
Don't deceive me
I've been telling lies
Because I've been doing fine
And if you don't believe me I've been feeling fine
So stop wasting all your time
So please don't leave me all night

Continuing lives and continuing tries
Will surely resolve the situation
So "game over" she said the level needed
For the time and the place has been defeated
So don't blame me - it's hard to believe it was love we had
Because I've been doing fineYou might also likeEmbed
