Ah!
Oh, yeah

It's all in motion, no stoppin' it now
I got nothing to lose and only one way up
I'm burnin' bridges, I destroy the mirage
All visions of collisions, fuckin' bon voyage

It's all smooth sailin' from here on out, yeah

I got bruises and hickeys, stitches and scars
Got my own theme music, plays wherever I are
Fear is the hand that pulls your strings
A useless toy, pitiful plaything
I'm in flagrante
In every way, everyday

It's all smooth sailin' from here on out
I'm gon' do the damage that needs getting done, yeah

Well, God only knows one long vacation
If reason is priceless, there's no reason to pay for it
(It's so easy to see) yet so hard to find
Make a mountain of a molehill, if, if the molehill is mine
See Queens of the Stone Age LiveGet tickets as low as $24You might also like
I hypnotize you, ignore, then defy you
I blow my load over the status quo, here we go
I'm a little bit nonchalant when I dance
I'm riskin' it all-ways, no second chance

It's gonna be smooth sailin' from here on out, yeah
I'm gon' do the damage 'til the damage is done, yeah

Well, God only knows, so mind your behavior
Follow prescriptions of your loaded savior
(Every temple needs gold) Every hook needs to shine
Headaches at the temple of the closed mind
Closed mind
Closed mind
Closed blinds

(Ah, shut up, shut up)
It's all smooth sailin' from here on out
Oh, shut up
Oh, ooh
