2 ContributorsWeekend Lyrics
Lights out, boys sleepwalking on the weekend
Black out, tonights killing off the best friend
Fall out, like soldiers walking off the deep end
Hands out, don't stop marching 'til the hearts rend

The time goes by and sets the stage
They play their parts and act their age
They never forget the lines that they say
Speaking slowly...

I promise you one day
I promise you always
We'll make it out one day
I promise you always

Nights out, girls keep walking on the east end
White out, two lights shining on a dead end
Drawn out like circles trailing off the pavement
Stand out, don't stop marching 'til the hearts mend

This time goes by, reset the stage
We play the parts and act our age
We'll never forget the words that they'd say
Talking slowly...

I promise you one day
I promise you always
We'll make it out one day
I promise you always

Ahh-ahh
Ahh-ahhhh

I promise you one day
I promise you always
We'll make it out one day
I promise you alwaysEmbed
