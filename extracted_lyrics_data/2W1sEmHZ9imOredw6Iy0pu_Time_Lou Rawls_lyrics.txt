And a time to die
There's a time to know love
And a time to cry
There's a time to be young
And fill the world with laughter
A time to grow old
Wondering what comes after
A time for love
A time for tears
Oh well, all things in their time
There's a time to be hurt
There's a time to heal
There's a time to be hard
And then to realize
That time is just a word
That measures the changes
In the way that we feel
When life turns the pages
To a time for love
A time for tears
Oh well, all things in their timeYou might also likeEmbed
