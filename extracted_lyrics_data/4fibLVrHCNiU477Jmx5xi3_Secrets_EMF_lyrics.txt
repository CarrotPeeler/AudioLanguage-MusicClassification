2 ContributorsSecrets Lyrics
The children say, "run away
On the streets no one plays"
Going down to the bargain basement
See what you find, if you have the patience
Down so low, your nerves were raw
You find them all beneath the floor
Pass it by friends to meet
You find them all beneath the street

Too many secrets
Reasons defeat us
Precious, little reasons
To while away the days

Behind you, beneath you
Above you, all around you
It could have been you
Yeah, it could have been you

Too many secrets
Reasons defeat us
Precious little reasons
To while away the years
You might also like
Behind you, beneath you
Above you, all around you
All around you


It's so complicated
Your problems, were related
Crawling, long and lowly
It's dawning on us, slowly

Too many secrets
Reasons defeat us
Precious little reasons
To while away the days

Behind you, beneath you
Above you, all around you
All around you

What happened in there did you lose your mind? (Behind you)
When they knocked at the door did you make it in time?
Did you talk to god to see a sign? (Beneath you)
Was the devil next door was your soul on the line
Did it just appear did you ever chase it (Above you, all around you)
Did you really fall down can you ever face it
Do you always remember what you do
'Cause it could have been you
It could have been you
It could have been you
Yeah, it could have been youEmbed
