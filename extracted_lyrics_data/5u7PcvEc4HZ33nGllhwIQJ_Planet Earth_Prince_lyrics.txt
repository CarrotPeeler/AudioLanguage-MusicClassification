Imagine holding Planet Earth
In the palm of your hand
With no regard for your place of birth
Or claim to any land
The only thing between us now
Is the truth we understand
If Planet Earth was in the palm of your hand

Fifty years from now
What will they say about us here?
Did we care for the water and
The fragile atmosphere?
There are only two kind of folk
And the difference they make
The ones that give and the ones that take

Just like the countless bodies
That revolve around the sun
Planet Earth must now come into balance with the one
That caused it all to be
Then we'll see His kingdom come
So shall it be written, shall be sung
You might also like
Imagine you could rid the Earth
Of anyone you choose
Which ones would you need the most
And which ones would you lose?
Do we want to judge another
Lest we be judged too?
Careful now, the next one might be you

Just like the countless bodies
That revolve around the sun
Planet Earth must now (right now) come into balance with the one
That caused it all to be
And then we'll see His kingdom come
So shall it be written, shall be sung

Imagine sending your first born
Off to fight a war
With no good reason how it started
Or what they are fighting for
And if they're blessed to make it home
Will they still be poor?
Pray for peace right now and forever more
Just like the countless bodies
That revolve around the sun
Planet Earth must now come into balance with the one
That caused it all to be
Then we'll see His kingdom come
So shall it be written, shall be sung
Say it one more time
Just like the countless bodies
That revolve around the sun
Planet Earth must now come into balance with the one
That caused it all to be
Then we'll see His kingdom come (see His kingdom come)
So shall it be written, shall be sung (shall be sung)
Oh yeah, yeah
So shall it be written, shall be sung1Embed
