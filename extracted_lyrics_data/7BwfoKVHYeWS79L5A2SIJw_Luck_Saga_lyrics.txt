1 ContributorLuck LyricsSeems to me a crime
To waste what little time we're given
Searching for something of a fortunate kind
And we spend our days
Inventing ways to feel more driven
Just a little bit more
To buy us just a but more time
I know what you need
You're not hard to read
You know what you need...
Luck - Celebrate your fate
Black cat - We'll make something outta nothing. So let's go
Luck - Take a leap of faith
Black cat - Nothin' ventured where'd that get ya? So let's go
So each time we try
To push with even more persistence
Chances are we're really only playing for time
So we try at last
Our daily path of least resistance
Only to find another at the head of the line
I know what you need
You're not hard to read
You know what you need...
