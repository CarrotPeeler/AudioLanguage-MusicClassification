1 ContributorSteel Of The Dagger LyricsOut of the twilight and into the black the words gas been spoken there's
No turning back time's running out there's no future for you the moment
Will come at the time of doom
Listen to choirs of the ritual killing behold all the servants of death
You'll feel alone at your honor of pain feel the power rushing through
Your veins now
Now join my ritual, se the candles, burns at the altar of human sarifice
Listen to the the evil chant , see the blood run red the steel of dagger
Cuts deep
Into the cult of dmnation and fear preachers of blasphemy always is near
Victims of blood has been banished to hell
Listen to choirs of the ritual killing behold all the servants of death
You'll feel alone at your honor of pain feel the power rushing through
Your veins now
