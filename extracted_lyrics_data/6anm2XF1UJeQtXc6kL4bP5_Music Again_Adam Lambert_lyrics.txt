3 ContributorsMusic Again Lyrics
I want your body, mind, soul, et cetera
And one day you'll see (You should give it to me)
And I don't want anyone instead of you
Oh babe, I'm going crazy (Come on and give it to me)
And I ain't never met nobody better-er
You're someone else, baby

I'm so sick of living for other people
Took meeting you to realize
I don't wanna lose ya, I wanna keep ya
Put your little hand in mine and look into my eyes, baby, eyes

Oh, you make me wanna listen to music again
Yeah, you make me wanna listen to music again

There had been many moons before I met ya
And I don't know when (When I last put paper to pen)
And now you give me back my raison d'Ãªtre
And I'm inspired again

And I know in some ways, we're kinda evil
Got my roots and you've got ties
But my heart's no stranger to upheaval
Put your little hand in mine and look into my eyes, baby, eyes
You might also like
Oh, you make me wanna listen to music again (Yeah)
Yeah, you make me wanna listen to music again

Ah, music again
Look into my eyes, baby, eyes
I just wanna listen to music again
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Woo
Oh-oh
Hey

I'm so sick of living for other people
Took meeting you to realize
I don't wanna lose ya, I wanna keep ya
Put your little hand in mine and look into my eyes, baby, eyes

Whoa, oh, you make me wanna listen to music again
Whoa, oh, yeah, you make me wanna listen to music again
Whoa, oh, you make me wanna listen to music again
Whoa, oh, yeah, you make me wanna listen to music again1Embed
