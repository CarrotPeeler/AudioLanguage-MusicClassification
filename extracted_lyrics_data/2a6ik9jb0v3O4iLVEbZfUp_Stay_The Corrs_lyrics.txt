2 ContributorsStay LyricsPrayers float as coloured letters to the Gods
Make mine a land without compassion
A melting pot of pain stirred slowly to the boil
We had a radar now it's gone
This is a cruel cruel love
I stood on the dark side of love
This is a cruel cruel love
I stood on the dark side alone
Let love light your way
Forever always with me stay
I'll live while I'm alive
Forever always with me stay
With me stay
I'm still reeling though I knew you'd one day go
There's no softening this shock
Write me a song, throw me back upon your knee
Help me move forward now I've lost where I began
This is a cruel cruel love
I stood on the dark side of love
This is a cruel cruel love
I stood on the dark side alone

This is a cruel cruel love
I stood on the dark side of love
This is a cruel cruel love
