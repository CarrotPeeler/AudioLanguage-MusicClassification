1 ContributorChance Of A Lifetime LyricsSometimes the heart can lead you where few have ever been
Can take you to the limit time and time again
Something moves the spirit like something moves the wind
I felt it and I followed, now the roads about to end
This is the chance of a lifetime, can't let it slip away
This is the moment I've dreamed of, it all comes down today
Whatever it takes I'm willing to give
I know I was born to live for the chance, chance of a lifetime
Born to live for the chance, for the chance of a lifetime
We find our own direction, we make our own mistakes
Some take the road that's easy, some play for higher stake
It's been a long time coming but it's been worth the wait
'Cause now I know I'm ready to touch the hand of fate
This is the chance of a lifetime, can't let it slip away
This is the moment I've dreamed of, it all comes down today
Whatever it takes I'm willing to give
I know I was born to live for the chance, chance of a lifetime
This is the chance of a lifetime, can't let it slip away
This is the moment I've dreamed of, it all comes down today
Whatever it takes I'm willing to give
I know I was born to live for the chance, for the chance
For the chance, for the chance of a lifetime
