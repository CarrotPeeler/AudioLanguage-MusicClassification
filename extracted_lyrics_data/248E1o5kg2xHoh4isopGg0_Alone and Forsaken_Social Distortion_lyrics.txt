3 ContributorsAlone and Forsaken Lyrics
We met in the springtime when blossoms unfold
The pastures were green and the meadows were gold
Our love was in flower as summer grew on
Our love, like the leaves, now have withered and gone

The roses have faded, there's frost at my door
The birds in the morning don't sing anymore
The grass in the valley is starting to die
And out in the darkness the whippoorwills cry

Alone and forsaken by fate and by man
Oh Lord, if you hear me, please hold to my hand
Oh, please understand

Oh where has she gone to, oh where can she be?
She may have forsaken some other like me
She promised to honor, to love and obey
Each vow was a plaything that she threw away

Alone and forsaken by fate and by man
Oh Lord, if you hear me, please hold to my hand
Oh, please understand

The darkness has fallen, the sky has turned gray
The hound in the distance is starting to bay
I wonder, I wonder what she's thinking of
Forsaken, forgotten, without any love

Alone and forsaken by fate and by man
Oh Lord, if you hear me, please hold to my hand
Oh, please understand

Alone and forsaken by fate and by man
Oh Lord, if you hear me, please hold to my hand
Oh, please understand

Oh, please understand
Oh, please understandEmbed
