3 ContributorsFar Side of Nowhere Lyrics
I wake up, drink my coffee
Put on my pants and comb my hair
Today’s the day, I ain’t got nothing
I ain’t got nothing, I ain’t got a care

The sun is out, it’s shining bright
The birds are singing and the skies are blue
My motor runs a lover’s heartbeat
It’s just me and you

Put the pedal to the metal
Baby, turn the radio on
We can run to the far side of nowhere
We can run ‘til our days are gone

And ignorance, they say is bliss
So today I’m king of these hills
We’re gonna drive, drive to nowhere
Ain’t gonna stop until

We put the pedal to the metal
Baby, turn the radio on
We can run to the far side of nowhere
We can run ‘til our days are gone

Put the pedal to the metal
Baby, turn the radio on
We can run to the far side of nowhere
We can run ‘til our days are gone

Put the pedal to the metal
Baby, turn the radio on
We can run to the far side of nowhere
We’re gonna run ‘til our days are goneEmbed
