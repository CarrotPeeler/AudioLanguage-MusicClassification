1 ContributorAmong the Pines LyricsShe lost her way among the pines
They haven't found her to this day
The sheriff says they have no leads
I wake up sweating every night
I heard her scream, I heard to beg
But I didn't get up from my bed
What would they think?
If they knew
I was a coward like they said?
I'll never tell
I saw the man
It was my cousin Billy Greenburg
And I know the spot
Where her body lies
But it will remain there
