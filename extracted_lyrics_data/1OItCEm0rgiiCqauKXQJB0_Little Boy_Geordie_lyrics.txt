1 ContributorLittle Boy LyricsHey come here, let me look at you
Your virgin eyes they are so blue
Doesn't anyone take care of you little boy?
Where's your mommy, is she out again?
No doubt she's got a pen
Crossing numbers of a card
This world has got no heroes
Where it's going nobody knows
This world is such a cruel place
And your Daddy's workin' down a mine
He never seems to have the time
For a little boy like you, little boy
Shouldn't you, you be at school
Teacher finds out, you'll get the rule
But it's your mommy who is the fool
She is a fool
This world has got no heroes
Where it's going nobody knows
This world is such a cruel place
You'll leave home one day, it's true
Then their gonna want you
But it's too late, you've gone
You might also likeThis world has got no heroes
Where it's going nobody knows
This world is such a cruel place
La-la-la la-la-la-la
La-la-la la-la-la-la
La-la-la la-la-la-la...Embed
