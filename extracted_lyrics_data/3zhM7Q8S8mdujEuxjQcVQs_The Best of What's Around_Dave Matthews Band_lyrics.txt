10 ContributorsThe Best Of Whatâ€™s Around Lyrics
Hey, my friend
It seems your eyes are troubled
Care to share your time with me?
Would you say you're feeling low and so
A good idea would be to get it off your mind?

See, you and me
Have a better time than most can dream
Have it better than the best
So can pull on through
Whatever tears at us
Whatever holds us down
And if nothing can be done
We'll make the best of what's around

Turns out not where, but who you're with
That really matters
And hurts not much when you're around
When you're around

And if you hold on tight
To what you think is your thing
You may find you're missing all the rest
Well she ran up into the light surprised
Her arms are open
Her mind's eye is
You might also like
Seeing things from a
Better side than most can dream
On a better road I feel
Oh, you could say she's safe
Whatever tears at her
Whatever holds her down
And if nothing can be done
She'll make the best of what's around

Turns out not where, but what you think
That really matters
That really matters
That really matters
That really matters, yeah

See, you and me
Have a better time than most can dream
Have it better than the best
So can pull on through
Whatever tears at us
Whatever holds us down
And if nothing can be done
We'll make the best of what's around
Turns out not where, but who you're with
That really matters
And hurts not much when you're around
When you're around
We'll make the best of what's aroundEmbed
