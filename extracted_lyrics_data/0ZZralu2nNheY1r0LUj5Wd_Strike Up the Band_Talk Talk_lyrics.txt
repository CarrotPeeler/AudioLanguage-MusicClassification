Driving in the back seat around the town
Listen to the lights, I want to see the sound
Of music playing in my head
I never heard a word you said

Oh, oh-uh-oh, oh-uh-oh
The beats are kicking in
Oh, oh-uh-oh, oh-uh-oh
Your ears don't hear a thing
Strike up the band

Looking for reaction without the crowd
Looking in the doors I get the run around
You never heard a word I said
I've seen this music in my head

Oh, oh-uh-oh, oh-uh-oh
The beats are kicking in
Oh, oh-uh-oh, oh-uh-oh
Your ears don't hear a thing
Strike up the band
You might also like
You never heard a word I said
I've seen this music in my head

Oh, oh-uh-oh, oh-uh-oh
The beats are kicking in
Oh, oh-uh-oh, oh-uh-oh
Your ears don't hear a thing
Strike up the band
Strike up the band
Strike up the bandEmbed
