3 Contributorsâ€™Til I Whisper U Something LyricsSure hate to see you looking so sad
Delicate man it needn't be that bad
You sit with me and I will listen
You'll feel much better when you open
You said all you wanted was a good time
Like a big hill you have to climb
And you got to be willing
You stand tall and you be strong
You have ruthless compassion
For yourself and for everyone
Yeah it's hard but it can be done
I know you've every right to feel grief
You've not had anything that you need
But you put your head on my shoulder
'Til I whisper you something
'Til I whisper you something
It don't take much to have a good time
A lot of lovemaking and a little wind
And u got to be willing
You stand tall and you stand strong
You try ruthless compassion
For yourself and for everyone
Yeah it's hard but it can be done
You might also likeBut you put your head on my shoulder
'Til I whisper you something
'Til I whisper you something
It's a long walk towards a good time
It's a big hill you have to climb
And you got to be willing
It don't take much to have a good time
A lot of lovemaking and a little wind
And you got to be willing
If you've never seen a good time
If you've never seen a good time
If you've never seen a good time
How would you recognise one
How would you recognise one, how would you?
How would you even find one?
How would you, if you've never seen a good time?
If you've never seen a good time
If you've never seen a good time
How would you recognise one?Embed
