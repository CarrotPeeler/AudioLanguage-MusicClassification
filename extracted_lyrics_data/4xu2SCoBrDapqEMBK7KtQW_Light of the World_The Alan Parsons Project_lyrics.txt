5 ContributorsLight of the World LyricsI am just a stranger in a promised land
I am only learning a game with rules I don't understand
Going round in circles, I've been round before
I am lost in so many ways
I can walk no more
I can walk no more
I am just a drifter, in an open sea
But no matter how much I try, the tide will not turn for me
Going round in circles, till I reach the shore
I am blown by so many winds
I can take no more
I can take no more
Light of the world, I stand alone
Cause I could not see the light of the world
Show me the fire, in a true believer's eye
I am just a dreamer, when I close my eyes
I can fly so close to the sun, that I can not see it rise
Going round in circles, in a silent sky
I am lost for so many words
I can not say why
I can not say why
Light of the world, I stand alone
Cause I could not see the light of the world
Show me the fire, in a true believer's eye

But no matter which way I turn, I journey into the night
Going round in circles, till the mountains fall
To believe in so many truths
It makes no sense at all
Makes no sense at all
Light of the world, I stand alone
Cause I could not see the light of the world
I was afraid, cause I could not see the light of the world
Show me the fire, in a true believer's eyeEmbed
