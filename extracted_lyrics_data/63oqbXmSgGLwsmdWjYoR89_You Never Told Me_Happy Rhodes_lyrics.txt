14 ContributorsYears to Go Lyrics
It feels like I spent a lifetime here alone
Since we ended, our time's been moving slow
I heard 'em say it takes twice as long
To forget someone, as it does to get to know
Now I'm three days in, got three more years to go
Yeah, uh

Remember when the first night we kicked it, we talked all night
Smokin' weed in my room talkin' about life
What's crazy I ain't even smash the first night
I kinda feel like I met you inside a past life
Remember, got arrested in Texas together
On a roadtrip to Cali, they found the weed in my sweater
You never told me shit or to quit or go and do better
But I promise this time, I'm gettin' my shit together
Front row at my first shows, went into reverse roles
Put myself first before her goals
We supposed to be here havin' weddin' rehearsals
You know things about me no-one on this earth knows
I knew you were the one ever since day one
She said, "You know we're meant to be so why you play dumb?
I gave you too many hints, I wish you'd take one"
I'm feelin' like Robin Williams, when dreams may come
See G-Eazy LiveGet tickets as low as $45You might also like
It feels like I spent a lifetime here alone (I spent a lifetime)
Since we ended, our time's been moving slow (It's been moving slow)
I heard 'em say it takes twice as long
To forget someone, as it does to get to know (You know)
Now I'm twelve weeks in, two years, nine months to go

Ooh
Yeah
Ooh
Uh

Remember when the first time we got back together, talked all night
I said, "I'd like to do right by you, if that's all right"
On tour, missin' you, textin' you on a long flight
But somewhere down the road, I guess I lost sight
Scrollin' deep through your 'Gram, lookin' at old pics
I should double-tap something, but that's a bold risk
Fuck, I stay on your page, you're still my top search
You sang my hooks and you sold all of my first merch
And your mom still texts me Merry Christmases
And Happy Birthdays, I'm missin' you in the worst ways
"All Apologies" feelin' when Kurt plays
Your birthdays and anniversaries are all my worst days
Her best friend wrote a letter and then she pressed send
After we broke up the last time, made it all end
She said, "Please for the love of God, let this sink in
No matter what stone you turn, never call her again"
It feels like I spent a lifetime here alone (Leave her the fuck the alone)
Since we ended, our time's been moving slow (Slow as fuck)
I heard 'em say it takes twice as long
To forget someone, as it does to get to know (The world stops spinnin' when you walked out of mine)
So I'm three years in and I'm not even close (I'm not even close, yeah)

Ooh
Ooh
Yeah, uh
Ooh
In my feelings, I hit you thinkin' I meant that
Read the text next day, why did I send that?
Ooh
Yeah, I just want my best friend back
Uh, I just want my best friend back

It feels like I spent a lifetime here alone
Since we ended, our time's been moving slow
I heard 'em say it takes twice as long
To forget someone, as it does to get to know
I just don't think I'll ever let it go1Embed
