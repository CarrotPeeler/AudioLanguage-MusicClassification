8 ContributorsHaunted When the Minutes Drag LyricsThe word that would
Best describe this feeling would be, 'haunted'
I touch the clothes you left behind
That still retain your shape and lines, still haunted
I trace the outline of your eyes
Blue in the mirror, hypnotized and haunted
I find a solitary hair gone
And still I reminisce, I'm haunted
Haunted by your soul
Haunted by your hair
Haunted by your clothes
Haunted by your eyes
By your soul, by your hair
By your clothes, by your eyes
By your voice, by your smile
By your mouth, by your soul
By your hair, by your clothes
By your eyes, by your voice
By your smile, by your mouth
By your soul, haunted (haunted)
So this is for when you feel happy
And this is for when you feel sad
And this is for when you feel...
Nothing

Ohh, when the minutes drag
And this is for the tears that won't dry
And this is for a bright blue sky
And this is for when you feel...
Lucky
And this is for when you feel...

Ohh, when the minutes drag
Ohh, when the minutes drag
So this is for when you're feeling happy again
And this is for when you're feeling sad
And this is for when you feel...
Something
Ohh, when the minutes drag
Ohh, when the minutes drag
Haunted (haunted)
When the minutes drag
Haunted (haunted)
When the minutes drag
Ohh
