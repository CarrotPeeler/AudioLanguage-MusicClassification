7 ContributorsAnything New Lyrics
Everything, is anything new?
The future is a thing that's a danger to you
Even though minimum is maximum
Gold never will become platinum

I don't get what's up with you
Is it the way that you don't move?
Got to get your ass out of the way
That, the others can copy too
The future isn't part of your identity
Never will it be fine
Rather will it be a personality
That you have to really define


Everything, is anything new?
Everything, is anything new?

Anything new, is anything new?
Is anything new, is anything new?
Is anything new, is anything new?
Is anything new, is anything new?
Is anything new, is anything new?
Is anything new, is anything new?
Is anything new, is anything new?
Is anything new, is anythingYou might also likeEmbed
