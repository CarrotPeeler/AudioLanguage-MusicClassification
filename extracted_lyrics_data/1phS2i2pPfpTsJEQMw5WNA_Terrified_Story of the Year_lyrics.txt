5 ContributorsTerrified LyricsHere in this town, safe and guarded
We call it home, a feeling that we share
Now leave this place, clinging to hope
In this midnight prayer
If we hold our breath, float beyond this
We'll be reborn, I will carry us home
Are you still alive? Are you scared inside?
Providence is blind when you're terrified
Are you still alive? Are you scared inside?
When we've reached the end of the road
I will carry us home
Oh no, if all our sin was only a hope
And meaningless and true
Now will I expire holding the world
In safety for you
If we make it through and I can save you
With this heart I know, I will carry us home
Are you still alive? Are you scared inside?
Providence is blind when you're terrified
Are you still alive? Are you scared inside?
When we've reached the end of the road
(Reached the end of the road)
I will carry us home
You might also likeAnd now I'm so far away from you
Will I be making any difference
After leaving you all alone?
And now I'm so far away from home
Can I justify my actions
After leaving you here in this town?
Safe and guarded, we call it home
A feeling that we shared
Are you still alive? Are you scared inside?
Providence is blind when you're terrified
Are you still alive? If you're scared inside
(I will carry you home)
I will carry us home
Are you still alive? Are you scared inside?
Providence is blind when you're terrified
Are you still alive? Are you scared inside?
When we've reached the end of the road
(Reached the end of the road)
When we've reached the end of the road
(Reached the end of the road)
I will carry us home, carry us homeEmbed
