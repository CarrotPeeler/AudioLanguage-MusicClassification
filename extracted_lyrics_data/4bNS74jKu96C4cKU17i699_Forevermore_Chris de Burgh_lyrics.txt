3 ContributorsForevermore LyricsI wake with the dawn, something is wrong, then I hear you
Breathing softly by my side
And I know that I was dreaming of a time that may come when
You would be no longer in my life
I slip out of bed, I go downstairs
Still troubled by the power of the dream
And I know that I don't say it quite as much as I should the
Way I feel and what you mean to me
You are my lover, you are my friend, you are my life to the
Very end
You bring me comfort, you keep me warm, you give me hope
You make me strong, you take me away to a distant shore
And it's with you that I want to stay forevermore
You go out at night, you're looking so good, people turning
As you walk into the room
When I stand beside you I can feel the pride in my heart to
Know that you are here with me tonight
You are my lover, you are my friend, you are my life to the
Very end
You bring me comfort, you keep me warm, you give me hope
You make me strong, you take me away to a distant shore
And it's with you that I'm going to stay forevermore
Yes, it's with you that I'm going to stay forevermore
Yes, it's with you that I'm going to stay forevermore
