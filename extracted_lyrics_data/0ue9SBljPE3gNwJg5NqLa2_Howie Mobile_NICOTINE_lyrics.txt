1 ContributorHowie Mobile LyricsI'm sitting in my car
Everything just feels alright
All the stars are shining bright
And my worries disappear
When I turn my face away
And you look into my eyes
All the time we're having fight
We stay in my car
Even though I lose my sight
I should never lose my pride
Just like my favorite car go the yellow car
Oh year, running fast
Go mobile to the bar Go mobile to the bar
Hit the road! We are having a good time
Go mobile to the bar for the future we will be
Drive me crazy (so) I can dance in a hallway
Not to get back the chance
From the past time oh yeahYou might also likeEmbed
