1 ContributorSwan Song LyricsI don't want to talk about it
I feel burned all over
I don't want to talk to you at all
I don't want to think about it
'Cause it hurts me the same way every time
I run through the detail in my mind
Don't you wish that we could do this one over
Maybe get it right, maybe just hold on
Feels like the end of summer
Feels like our last goodbye
Feels like we're letting go
And this is our swan song
If you know you don't ask
If you ask you don't know what is up with me
If you cared I think that I would know
I turn a corner slowly, here I am
Still the same, nothing's changed
The difference is I didn't stay
And we won't ever know
'Cause this one won't blow overYou might also likeEmbed
