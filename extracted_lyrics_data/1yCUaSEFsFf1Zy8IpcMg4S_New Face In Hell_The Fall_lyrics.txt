Wireless enthusiast intercepts
Government secret radio band
And uncovers secrets and scandals
Of deceitful type proportions

Aghast goes next door to his neighbor
Secretly excited, as aforementioned
Was a hunter whom radio enthusiast
Wanted friendship and favor of

A new face in hell!
Nearly a new face in hell!

A muscular, thick-skinned
Slit-eyed neighbor is at the table
Poisoned just thirty seconds before
By parties who knew of wireless operator's
Forthcoming revelation

A new face in hell!
You might also like
A prickly line of sweat
Covers enthusiast's forehead
As the realization hits him that
The same government him and
His now dead neighbor voted for
And backed and talked of on cream porches
Have tricked him into their war
Against the people who enthusiast
And dead hunter would have wished torture on
A servant of government walks in
And arrests wireless fan in kitchen
For murder of his neighbor

A new face in hell!
A new face in hell!
A new face in hell!
A new face in hell!
A new face in hell!
A new face in hell!
A new face in hell!
A new face in hell!
The dead cannot contradict
Sometimes the living cannot
A new face in hell!
A new face in hell!
A new face in hell!
A new face in hell!Embed
