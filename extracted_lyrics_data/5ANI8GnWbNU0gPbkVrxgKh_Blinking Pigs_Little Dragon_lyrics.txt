Phantom legs and blinking pigs haunting me
My long lost love and the memories of you

These nights are haunting me
I don’t want to run, I don’t want to leave
Now that you're standing closer
I don’t want to run, I don’t want to leave

Was a distant moan and a smell of home haunting me
From the clouds above and a memory of you

Oh, these nights are haunting me
I don’t want to run, I don’t want to leave
Now that you're standing closer
I don’t want to run, I don’t want to leave
Oh, these nights are haunting me
I don’t want to run, I don’t want to leave
Now that you're standing closer
I don’t want to run, I don’t want to leaveYou might also like2Embed
