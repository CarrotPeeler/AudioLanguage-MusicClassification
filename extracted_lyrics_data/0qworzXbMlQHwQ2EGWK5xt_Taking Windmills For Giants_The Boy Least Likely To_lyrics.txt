Sleeping against someone, dreaming of somebody else
I might believe in you, but I believe in you happy
Glancing back at the sun setting over a house that was our home
Love, love will always know
When it is time to let someone go
But loneliness will always hold on for too long
Knowing it was ending, but still pretending it had just begun, 'gun, 'gun, 'gun
Love can be such a mess
Produces just the mess I'm in
I guess there can't always be rainbows after a rain
I made us miserable by taking windmills for giants
I don't take windmills for anything other than windmills anymore
Love, love will always know
When it is time to let someone go
But loneliness will always hold on for too long
Knowing I was leaving, but not believing it 'til I'm gone, gone, gone, gone
I've taken windmills for, I've taken windmills for giants
I've taken windmills for, I've taken windmills for giants
I've taken windmills for, I've taken windmills for giants
I've taken windmills for, I've taken windmills for giants

When it is time to let someone go
But loneliness will always hold on 'til the end
Knowing it was over, but always hoping it could start again, 'gain, 'gain, 'gainEmbed
