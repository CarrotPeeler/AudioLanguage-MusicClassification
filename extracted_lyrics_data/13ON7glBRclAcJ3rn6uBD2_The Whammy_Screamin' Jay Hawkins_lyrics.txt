2 Contributors(She Put the) Whammee (On Me) Lyrics
I met a big woman with eyes of fury
Had a voice as hard as stone
Vowed she'd get me, couldn't live without me
Said she'd use her mojo bone

Oh, she put the whammee, oh, she put the whammee
Oh, she put the whammee on poor, poor, poor me
Oh, I'm walking sideways, oh, my mind's in neutral
Oh, she put the evil eyeball, evil eyeball on me

I bought a shotgun, a great, big, long shotgun
I put the barrel upside her head
I said release me, I ain't lyin', woman, release me
Or I'll blow the moonlight clean through your bald head

Oh, she put the whammee, oh, she put the whammee
Oh, she put the whammee on poor, poor, poor me
Lord, I'm walking sideways, oh, my mind's in neutral
Oh, she put the evil eyeball on me

Well, they taught me about the evils
About love and its mystery
They didn't teach me about the women
Who deal in fools like meYou might also likeEmbed
