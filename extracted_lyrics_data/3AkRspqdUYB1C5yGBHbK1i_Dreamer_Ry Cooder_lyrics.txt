1 ContributorDreamer Lyrics
I wonder would you like to meet a dreamer
Will you share a glass or two
Of red, red wine and you might find
I'm a simple one like you

What do you drive? I like Chevrolet
They don't make them like they used to do
If it's Japanese, please don't feel ashamed
Come sit here with me, there's just room for two

Can you remember trolleys passing by?
Quiet streets leafy trees at twilight time
Vernon Green used to sing "The Letter"
He lived down on the corner, he was a friend of mine

My brother passed, it's been two years
He's resting now in Glendale town
We're all together in this picture here
Trenta y Ocho boys in his '39

Yes I've lapsed I must confess
Missed communion since he's gone
I'm drinking more, here's another glass
Please don't go when the night is young
You might also like
I wonder would you like to meet a dreamer
Would you share a thought or two
Of a vanished time and you might find
That you' re a dreamer tooEmbed
