1 ContributorThe Great Reward LyricsNow it’s time to make a choice
Sing alone or with one voice
In a choir of rescued souls, you don’t have to be alone anymore
Throw off the ties that bind
See through the eyes once blind
Break down the barriers, no need for chains anymore
Maybe the time has come to set things right
To take a chance, and trust the maker
Stop listening to fools and you might plainly see
That some things are built to last forever
Now that you’ve seen the signs
Now you’ve endured the trials
A purpose redefined
You’ve found the part of yourself…that’s been missing?
Now your destiny awaits
As all the past mistakes
Fade like flowers in the sun, flowers in the sun
And all that’s left to do
Is embrace the sweet perfume
And take your place as son, take your place as son
And the artificial thoughts
Give place to all that’s true
They’re dropped into the sea and remembered no more
And the stains are washed away
As you start a brand new day
And receive the great reward for the sacrifice adoredYou might also likeEmbed
