Die for Allah
Die for Jerusalem
Die for Torah
Father and son marching in rhythm
Firing bullets through the skulls of the children
Holy war
Mortars and martyrs
Holy war
Unholy followers
Holy war
Brainwashed with death
Holy war
Unholy mess
I reject the laws of the misguided
False prophets imprison nations
Fueling self annihilation
I reject pocket lined political demons
Who arm the ignorant for election season
Empires buried in sand
A history of the failures in man
Armies of guardians, servants of bibles
Reciting verses as they stand before rifles
Millions of lives erased
Hatred marked as madness
Violence in leaves of scripture
A world aflame with malice
We will all die for nothing
See Thy Art Is Murder LiveGet tickets as low as $77You might also likeThere is silence in the house of God
There is only the cry of hell
There is silence in the house of God
There is only the cry of hell
Holy war
Mortars and martyrs
Holy war
Unholy followers
Holy war
Brainwashed with death
Holy war
Unholy mess
