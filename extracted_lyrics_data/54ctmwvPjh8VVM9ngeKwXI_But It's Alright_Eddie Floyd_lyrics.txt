3 ContributorsBut Itâ€™s Alright LyricsYou don't know how I feel
You never know just how I feel
When I needed you to come around
You always tried to put me down
Oh but I'm tellin' you, girl
Believe what I say
That you surely, surely gonna pay
But it's alright, alright, girl
You hurt me but it's alright
Oh but one day you will see
You'll never find a guy like me
Who'll treat you right both day and night
You'll never have to worry 'cause it's alright
Oh but I'm tellin' you, girl
And I guess you know it's true
That I was made to love only you
But it's alright, alright, girl
It's alright, alright, girl, oh yeah
My my my baby, my my my baby, yeah
It's alright, alright, girl
Hey it's alright, alright, girl
Now there's one thing I wanna say
You'll find a guy, he'll make you pay
He'll treat you bad, he'll made you sad
And you will lose the love you had
But I'm sorry to say I told you so
That baby, you got to reap just what you sow
But it's alright, alright, girl
Hey it's alright, alright, girl
It's alright, alright, girl
He'll treat you bad, he'll mad you sad
But it's alright, alright, girl....You might also likeEmbed
