2 ContributorsNot like you Lyrics(Intro chorus Charlie Sloth)
You’re not like me I ain’t got a deal but I still got heat
I’m not like you – you’re not like me
You’re known in the hood I’m known overseas
I’m not like you…
(Verse 1 Charlie Sloth)
I am a new breed of rapper I was built to last
I don’t lie to my fans or fabricate my past
I don’t lie to myself, I don’t wear a mask
I don’t say I sell drugs, I’m not a grass
I don’t wear jeans so tight that they crush my balls
I don’t take advantage dating girls still in school
I don’t buy car for around 100 grand
And then sit around because I can’t afford the fuel
I don’t swagger jack, I don’t follow trends
I don’t borrow jewelry from my friends
I don’t borrow lines, don’t borrow rhymes
I just speak my mind
I know the truth of things
I don’t sign a deal to put myself in debt
Say I’m working on an album that’s ain’t ready yet
I just keep it moving
It’s fresh and new
I know I am many things but I am not like you
You might also like(Chorus)
You’re not like me I ain’t got a deal but I still got heat
I’m not like you – you’re not like me
You’re known in the hood I’m known overseas
I’m not like you – you’re not like me
I ain’t got a deal but I still got heat
I’m not like you - you’re not like me
You’re known in the hood, I’m known overseas
I’m not like you
(Verse 2 - Farma G)
Yo check it listen
Charlie hooked me up with a beat and it’s a gem
He asked me if I could spit 16 – but not like them
Coz I’m not like you, I don’t glamorise swagger that’s what young kids do
I just speak the truth
I don’t perpetrate a lifestyle I never lived
I don’t shoot guns, just shoot the gift
I ain’t a poser who is scared of what the people think
I ain’t a dick and I never been the weakest link
I could say I really care but I never lie
I ain’t heard your track and I ain’t seen you live
I ain’t a rapper who is hell bent on making dough
I am just a rapper who is concerned about the flow
I never liked Rick Ross, or the Game
I am not a fan of Akon or T-Pain
I just keep it real it’s the way I do
I know I am many things, but I’m not like you
(Chorus)
You’re not like me I ain’t got a deal but I still got heat
I’m not like you – you’re not like me
You’re known in the hood I’m known overseas
I’m not like you – you’re not like me
I ain’t got a deal but I still got heat
I’m not like you - you’re not like me
You’re known in the hood I’m known overseas
I’m not like you
(Verse 3 - Black the Ripper)
Alright so fuck it, I don’t sell my arse for a deal, I ain't a puppet
The streets know I am keeping it real, that’s why they bump it
Sloth said hop on this track, I’m like, I’ve got it
Charlie, Farma G and Sampson, they’ll love it
Anyway let’s get to the subject, I don’t act like a celeb
When I’ve nowhere near bust yet
I don’t show emotions when I’m upset
Poker face style you don’t know about them ones yet
And I never waste money on a dumb sket
Never pay a cabbie run down the alley like fuck them
I wear Gucci shoes you wear one-tens, spend £999 and flick you 1 pence
Always late, I’m as black as it gets
You all save the last dance I am above the rim
I don’t sit in the barber shop waiting for a trim
I get it plaited by a bitch while I’m packing out a spliff
You don’t know
(Chorus)
You’re not like me I ain’t got a deal but I still got heat
I’m not like you – you’re not like me
You’re known in the hood I’m known overseas
I’m not like you – you’re not like me
I ain’t got a deal but I still got heat
I’m not like you - you’re not like me
You’re known in the hood I’m known overseas
I’m not like youEmbed
