Title: "Unsung Heroine of Britain", position to attain (convenient fiction)
Housewife heroines, addicts to their homes
It's her factory (It's her factory!)
It's her duty (It's her factory!)
It's her factory (It's her factory!)
Paternalist journalist
He gives them sympathy, because they're not men (His sympathy!)
Scrubbing floors, they're close to the earth (They're close to the earth!)
In a man's world, they're not men
In a man's world, because they're not men
In a man's world, because they're not men
In a man's world, because they're not men
In a man's world, because they're not men
In a man's world, in a man's world
A little of a lot, keeps them happy
Avoid the answers, but keep them snappy
