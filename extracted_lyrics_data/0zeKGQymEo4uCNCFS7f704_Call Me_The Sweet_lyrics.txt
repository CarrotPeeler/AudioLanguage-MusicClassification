1 ContributorHalf-Baked (A Stoner Anthem) Lyrics
Lets go, Mike, second track
Bitch I'm real high
But I can't compete with this beat
Stoners anthem here I come and go
Woo-Ha

I'm half-baked, bitch, I’m half-baked
Smoke a lot of weed, bitch, I’m feeling great
So half-baked, bitch, I’m always late
Are you smoking weed? No, bitch, I’m really straight
I'm half-baked, bitch, I’m half-baked
Smoke a lot of weed, bitch, I’m feeling great
So half-baked, bitch, I’m always late
Are you smoking weed? No, bitch, I’m really straight

Mike Oxlong’s here and for a real reason
Hey mami, do you wanna get high off drugs this season
I’m like the fucking Michael Colins of this weed shit, Liam Neeson
Run as fast as I can to avoid somebody good-will-hunting me
Oh shit, apologize for Half-baked confronting
One thing you're gonna know about me, I like running
If you smile, it should set a positive tone
Funny thing, Mike used to be the boy you would never leave alone
Now when I see them, to me, there just some unknowns
Dr. Mike Oxlong, medical marijuana
What the fuck, kids, who’s parents have the closet drama
Beat a motherfucka so bad, he's gon' be asking for his momma
That Gucci, that Fendi, that fucking Prada
Bad trip to hell, now you probably have that trauma
Originally outta Chicago, now I’m moving to Tijuana
You might also like
I'm half-baked, bitch, I’m half-baked
Smoke a lot of weed, bitch, I’m feeling great
So half-baked, bitch, I’m always late
Are you smoking weed? No, bitch, I’m really straight
I'm half-baked, bitch, I’m half-baked
Smoke a lot of weed, bitch, I’m feeling great
So half-baked, bitch, I’m always late
Are you smoking weed? No, bitch, I’m really straight

I love pussy, keep in mind, I’m swallowing mines
I got my high’s, I got my lows, hunch-backing my spine
That alien was a little over the influence, from the movie Signs
Man I just fucking space out, I need a mind refresher
I’m young and high, I’m a stoner but like forever
Dave Chappelle, that show is my pleasure
I’m not Top 10 or 13, but I’m top for not being clean
Nah wait, I mean when I’m buying me a new bag of Green
I mean I know weeds bad but the worst is that caffeine
Sauntering to and outta work, I work at the Dry Clean
So obvious that could smell the goods outta the pockets of my jeans
Mike Oxlong, but call me the sweetest and meanest motherfuckin' machine
The word is, smoke that weed by all means
Whatchu mean "what do you mean", bitch please
I'm half-baked, bitch, I’m half-baked
Smoke a lot of weed, bitch, I’m feeling great
So half-baked, bitch, I’m always late
Are you smoking weed? No, bitch, I’m really straight
I'm half-baked, bitch, I’m half-baked
Smoke a lot of weed, bitch, I’m feeling great
So half-baked, bitch, I’m always late
Are you smoking weed? No, bitch, I’m really straight

Smoke too damn much, I’m starting to lose the sight of my eyes
Can’t blow up? Well at least you tried
Cause’ nobody ever seems to fucking care
Giving my ego the best of me and not a blowjob
I’ll have Michael out and send Mike out to rob
Rap has the new Mike Oxlong while Rock still has Lynch Mob
How I squash beef, pull out the weed, lets puff-puff it
Few minutes later, we already buried the hatchet
Easy to spot, the one with a bucket hat and black leather jacket
There's 9 planets, and I’m smoking peacefully on Earth
Would say I’ve been smoking since birth
Ya heard?

I'm half-baked, bitch, I’m half-baked
Smoke a lot of weed, bitch, I’m feeling great
So half-baked, bitch, I’m always late
Are you smoking weed? No, bitch, I’m really straight
I'm half-baked, bitch, I’m half-baked
Smoke a lot of weed, bitch, I’m feeling great
So half-baked, bitch, I’m always late
Are you smoking weed? No, bitch, I’m really straight
Man, I’m off, I’m going to, you know
Puff puff give
Enjoy the next track, MOEmbed
