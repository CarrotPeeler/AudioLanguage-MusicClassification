1 ContributorToo Many Balls LyricsThe cops showed up just the other day
Just to turn it down
There's nothing to do - nothing to say
Too many balls just gettin in the way
And they're not my friends and I blame them all
And they're not my friends and I blame them all
And they're all tough as nails
And they're all hard as a rock
And they're all tough as nails
And they're all hard as a rock
There's too many balls all around this place
Too many can-i-balls
Brainwashed ammo high on rape
So much cum that I never feel safe
And they're not my friends and I blame them all
And they're not my friends and I blame them all
And they're all hard as a rock
And they're all tough as nails
And they're all hard as a rock
And they're all tough as nails
Too many balls gonna kill us all (x9)
And we're all choking on nuts
Too many balls gonna kill us all
And we're all choking on nuts
