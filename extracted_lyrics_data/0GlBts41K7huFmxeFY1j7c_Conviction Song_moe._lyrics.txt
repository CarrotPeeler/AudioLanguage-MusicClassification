1 ContributorConviction Song LyricsOh, tell my mother, tell my son
Won't you remember about me and the things I've done?
Don't tell my brother, father too
Not till December when I'm dead and gone
And I will remain ever to blame
Won't you tell them about me?
I was once a man of conviction
Now I'm a wanted man, twice convicted
Sometimes a man will do anything that it takes to be free
One time was all that it took, take a look, they threw the book at me
And I will remain ever to blame
Won't you tell them about me?You might also likeEmbed
