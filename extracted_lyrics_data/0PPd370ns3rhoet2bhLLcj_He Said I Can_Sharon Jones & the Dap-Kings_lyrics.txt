2 ContributorsHe Said I Can Lyrics
There ain't nobody
Can take away the pain
I said nobody
There ain't nobody
Can take away the pain
I said nobody
Can take away the pain
After where I've been
I'll never love again
And then I found me a man
Mmm, he took me by the hand
He looked into my heart
And yes he said I can
Yes, he said

He said I can
He said I can
He said I can
He said I can

He said he could love me
Like nobody will
Said he'd take me out of the valley
Up to the top of the hill
He said he'd lift my burdens
And make my load a little lighter
And then I wanted to know
If he could take me even higher
You might also like
Oh, he said I can
He said I can
He said I can
He said I can, oh


Then I found me a man
He took me by my hand
He looked into my heart
And he said I can
Yes, he did

He said I can
He said I can
He said I can
He said I can

He said I can
He said I can
He said I can
He said I can
He said I can, I can, I can, I can, oh yeah
He said I canEmbed
