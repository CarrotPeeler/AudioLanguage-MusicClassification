Break outside
Break outside
Break outside
Tunnel vision, for a hundred thousand miles
Indecision, focused as a tiny child
Dilation, light escaping from your eyes
Keeping station, time lapses in the world outside
Palpitation, thumping like a hummingbird
Concentration, missing every single word
No admission, all the money in the world
On a mission, spinning like a little girl
Feel confined
Soul replies
Break outside of your cathedral
Heart is beating, inside out of you 
Inch by inch and step by step
Is the best that you can do
Your eyes on the horizon
And you don't look down
Temperature keeps rising
And your head keeps spinning 'round and 'round
You might also likeFeel confined
Soul replies
Break outside of your cathedral
Break outside of your cathedral
Of your cathedral
Break outside of your cathedral
Break outside
Break outside
Break outside
Break outside
Break outside
Break outside
Break outside
Break outside
Break outside
Break outside
Break outside of your cathedral
Break outside of your cathedral
Of your cathedral
Break outside of your cathedralEmbed
