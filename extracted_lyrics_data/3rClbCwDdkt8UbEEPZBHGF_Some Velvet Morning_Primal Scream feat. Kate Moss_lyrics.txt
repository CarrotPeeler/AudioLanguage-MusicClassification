Some velvet morning when I'm straight
I'm gonna open up your gates
Some velvet morning when I'm straight
I'm gonna open up your gates

Flowers growing on a hill
Dragonflies on daffodils
Learn from us very much
Look at us, but do not touch

Phaedra is my name

Some velvet morning when I'm straight
I'm gonna open up your gates
Some velvet morning when I'm straight
I'm gonna open up your gates

Flowers are the things we grow
Secrets are the things we know
Learn from us very much
Look at us, but do not touch
You might also like
Phaedra is my name

Some velvet morning when I'm straight
I'm gonna open up your gates

Flowers are the things we grow
Some velvet morning when I'm straight
Secrets are the things we know
Learn from us very much
I'm gonna open up your gates
Look at us, but do not touch
Look at us, but do not touch
Look at us, but do not touchEmbed
