If you wanna feel
Really happily
Just come over here
Listen what I say

Take a ride on the black dragon
Room enough for everyone

If you have the time
Be it night or day
Just to feel alive
Without any pain

Take a ride on the black dragon
Room enough for everyone
Take a ride on the black dragon
If you're down and need some fun

Black dragon
Black dragon

Take a ride on the black dragon
Room enough for everyone
Take a ride on the black dragon
If you're down and need some fun

Take a ride on the black dragon
Take a ride on the black dragon
Take a ride on the black dragon
Take a ride on the black dragonEmbed
