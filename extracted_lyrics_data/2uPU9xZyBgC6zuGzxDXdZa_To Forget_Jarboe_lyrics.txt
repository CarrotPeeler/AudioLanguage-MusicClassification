1 ContributorTo Forget LyricsI'm with you to forget my loneliness
I love you to love my loneliness
I love you to love my loneliness
And there’s no time
There’s no time for loving life
There’s no time
There’s no time for hating death
There’s only time
There’s only time to believe
To believe me
I'm with you to forget my loneliness
I love you to love my loneliness
And there’s no time
There’s no time for loving life
There’s no time
There’s no time for hating death
There’s only time
There’s only time to believe
To believe me
I love you to love my loneliness
I love youYou might also likeEmbed
