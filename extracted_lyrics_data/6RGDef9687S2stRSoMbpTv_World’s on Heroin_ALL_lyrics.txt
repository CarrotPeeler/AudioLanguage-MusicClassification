6 ContributorsWorldâ€™s on Heroin Lyrics
The world's on heroin
I'm on strike against all this laziness
I try to go for all
Despite all the underachievers

From the government to the drive-thru guy
The delayed results with no reasons why
My only guess, they must be high

I wanna put an end to all of them
But I don't know where to begin
'Cause I'm pretty sure the world's on heroin

The world's on heroin
Everybody is standin' in my way
I try to use my brain
Stupidity is thrown in my face

I'm a coffee guy in a stoner place
And the world keeps turnin' at a turtle's pace
Get it over with, and check into NA
You might also like
I wanna put an end to all of them
But I don't know where to begin
'Cause I'm pretty sure the world's on heroin

If I had my way
I'd prefer if everyone was on speed
I'm so sick of the "no-can-do"
And the failures you concede
At any rate, from the looks of things
Everyone's nodding out but me

The world's on heroin
Too many lazy morons in my face
The world's on heroin
Everybody acts like a zombie

I'm not sayin' I'm better than them
I don't have the kind of time to spend
With slacker types tryin' to be my friend

I wanna put an end to all of them
But I don't know where to begin
'Cause I'm pretty sure the world's on heroin
Yeah, I'm pretty sure the world's on heroin
Heroin!Embed
