1 ContributorTrans Am LyricsSo you just graduated from high school
And Daddy bought you a brand new Trans Am
It's the really cool black one with the big bird painted on the hood
And the fancy wheel with the tires with the letters on the
And those things in the back, you don't even know what they're called
Don't worry, no one'll notice, just buy a Playboy bunny air-freshener
A few stuffed animals, fuzzy dice, a stick-on rainbow for the back window
And everyone'll love your brand new car
But why do you take up three parking spaces?
Driving the car don't make you cool
Guy behind the wheel is still a fool
I hate Trans Ams they look like shit
I hate T.A.'s the driver's a prick
It's your last summer in town until you go off to college
Might as well have as much fun now as you can, bummer, man
You had to buy your own personalized license plates
But Mom is paying for your insurance, so you don't have a worry in the world
Except maybe gas money, and I bet you can pick up lots of really sweet babes
In your brand new Trans Am, maybe even the entire cheerleading squad
And they'll just love your brand new car. But you ain't goin' nowhereYou might also likeEmbed
