3 ContributorsWhen My Love Comes Down LyricsIt can be sun down
Or just before day
Can be in December
Or even in May
Oh, you don’t have to be around, daddy
The very thought of you
That’s all my love
All my love come down
Maybe I’m shopping
Going to the store
Molding my hair
Or listening to the radio
You know you don’t have to be around, daddy
All you got to do is cross my mind
And all my love
All my love come down
He done so much
To satisfy me
I’m chained to your love
I don’t ever, no, no, never
I don’t ever want to be free
You might also likeI say go get your papers, daddy
I’ll sign you my life
I’m going to leave everything behind
Just to be your wife
Then you can be found
I won’t have to worry, no
When all my love, all my love
Come… Oh!... downEmbed
