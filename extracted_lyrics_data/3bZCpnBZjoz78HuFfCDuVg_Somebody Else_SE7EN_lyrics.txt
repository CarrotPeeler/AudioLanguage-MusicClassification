4 ContributorsSomebody Else Lyrics
I can’t bear to hug you, who is in front of me
I can’t say a single word so every day
I am only looking at you like this
Right now, in your two eyes, already since a long time ago
A different person other than me
Is standing before you, smiling at you

Your back getting farther away is holding onto me
With the pointless hope that you might look back
I am always waiting for you

You love somebody else
Though I am standing here
If I can’t have you
Then I want to dance with your memories
Somebody else
Though I am standing here
If everything is a dream
I want to dance with your memories

I can look at you but I can’t approach you
I have no courage because I’m afraid we might grow far apart
So I’m waiting and I’m waiting
Though I don’t know where the end is
Everyone tells me that I’m such a fool but
No one knows my heart
My heart that only beats toward you cannot be stopped
You might also like
Your back getting farther away is holding onto me
With the pointless hope that you might look back
I am always waiting for you

You love somebody else
Though I am standing here
If I can’t have you
Then I want to dance with your memories
Somebody else
Though I am standing here
If everything is a dream
I want to dance with your memories

Will you just let me stay by your side?
I am happy the way things are right now
Behind you, for you
I will wait until that day

You love
You love somebody else
Though I am standing here
If I can’t have you
Then I want to dance with your memories
Somebody else
Though I am standing here
If everything is a dream
I want to dance with your memories
Somebody elseEmbed
