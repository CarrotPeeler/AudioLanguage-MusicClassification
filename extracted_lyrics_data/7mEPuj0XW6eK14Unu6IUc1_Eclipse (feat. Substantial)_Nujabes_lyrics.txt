This is for the things I don't say enough
Waitin' for the day we touch
Your lips to mine, eclipse solar lunar
I'll see you soon but I'll talk to you sooner
This is for the things I don't say enough
Waitin' for the day we touch
Your lips to mine, eclipse solar lunar
I'll see you soon but I'll talk to you sooner

Do you honestly believe I'd turn my back on you
And leave my true love all alone in this cruel world?
When every single solitary day I do my best
To secure a future for me and you, girl?
'Cause it is all about you, it's been all about you
Seconds feel like millenniums when I'm without you
But my momma said there'd be days like this
And ain't jack we can do, that's the way life is
But it's been weeks since I felt your lips
And I'm a fiend for my queen so I need a fix
Only for now, I'll settle for these talks on the phone
But I cut my arm off for a moment alone
With the one that I cherish whether in Rome or Paris
Amsterdam or Japan, please note that I am
Thinkin' bout my baby as much as humanly possible
And I know you're frustrated cos life has too many obstacles
You might also like
This is for the things I don't say enough
Waitin' for the day we touch
Your lips to mine, eclipse solar lunar
I'll see you soon but I'll talk to you sooner
This is for the things I don't say enough
Waitin' for the day we touch
Your lips to mine, eclipse solar lunar
I'll see you soon but I'll talk to you sooner

My dear, my dear, my dear, I know you're lonely
And I know very well that it's hard
And it hurts but there's no need to cry
'Cause I will be home soon
And there ain't no limit to the things that we gonna do
Whatever you want, name it and I'll make it reality
To see my baby's face nothin' means more than that for me
This is far from flattery, I ain't trying to impress you
Truth is, I miss you and I'm hurtin' internally
Sometimes, these long trips feel like eternity
But they say distance makes the heart grow fonder
And in this case it's proven to be fact
So I'll be back like a T100
From blocks away, you will see me comin'
With the biggest smile you ever seen on my face
'Cause even the toughest man on the planet needs lovin'
There's nothin' tame the wild like a woman's embrace, so um
This is for the things I don't say enough
Waitin' for the day we touch
Your lips to mine, eclipse solar lunar
I'll see you soon but I'll talk to you sooner
This is for the things I don't say enough
Waitin' for the day we touch
Your lips to mine, eclipse solar lunar
I'll see you soon but I'll talk to you sooner

Feels like it's been forever and I can't wait to see ya
It's like wit' Bonnie and Clyde, Tony and Maria
Romeo and Juliet, Akeem and Lisa
Basically inseparable and it's more than sexual
Withstand every shell, tell me, don't you like the sound of that?
Got my heart racin' and about to have a heart attack
Wantin' to be loved by you, just you
There's nobody loves you like I do
And I ain't scared to show it, but these feelings are hard to put into words
And I'm a poet slash MC, so give me credit for expressing them
Becos writin' this was more nervous than I ever been
I had to get it out for when I'm unable to sit with you
You have a little song that I wrote for you to listen to
So you know the way that you're missin' me, I'm missin' you
I wanna give you the world but for now, I hope this'll do14Embed
