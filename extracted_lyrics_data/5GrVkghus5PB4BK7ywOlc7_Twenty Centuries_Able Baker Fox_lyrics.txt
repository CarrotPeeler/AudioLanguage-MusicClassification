1 ContributorTwenty Centuries LyricsTwenty centuries
We're repeating all of history
Twenty centuries spent removing any mystery
Lift your head, take a look
Open your eyes, open a book
All this energy wasted on false security
We don't know shit
We're full of it and apathy
Lift your head, take a look
Open your eyes, open a book
Open your hearts, open your heads
Open your hands for what's understood
Hurry up
Someday things will change
Hurry up before it's too lateYou might also likeEmbed
