1 ContributorDeep in the Mud LyricsBlack dreams and crippled thoughts
They haunt me
Bet you're glad to meet me ain't you gal?
Now and then and if we can forever
Stickin' broken needles in our arms
Deep down, baby deep down
Deep in the mud
Somethin' down there's
Tuggin' at my leg
The barbed wire fence
Is hard to climb through
Try not to tear
Your pretty yellow dress
Police sirens they howl in the distance
Let’s go find a hole to crawl in to
I know what I've seen
I know, I've seen
Dead folks walkin' round
I bet you're glad to meet me
Ain't you gal?
Let's go cut our hands
And bleed together
Just like those drunk old
Indians always do
Then lets go get some tires
And start 'em burnin'
And warm ourselves within
Their angry glow

Deep in the mud
Somethin' down there’s
Tuggin' at my leg
I know what I've seen
I know, I’ve seen
Dead folks walkin' round
I bet you're glad to meet me
Ain't you gal?
Come on over here and sit beside me
I got some things to say
You'll like to hear
Yes I do
Deep down baby deep down
Deep in the mudEmbed
