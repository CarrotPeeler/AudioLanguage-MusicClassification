1 ContributorAnyone LyricsLight my cigarette
It's gettin' hot here
We're goin' faster
Don't hit the red light
You can't stop me
I keep movin'
We're goin' faster
I don't wanna be
Just like anyone
I don't wanna be
Just like you
I don't wanna be
Just like everyone
I don't wanna be
I don't wanna be like you
Can you tell me what you're going through?
Can you tell me reasons why?
Yeah I'm a motor
A heavy roller
The head controller
I don't wanna be
Just like anyone
I don't wanna be
Just like you
I don't wanna be
Just like everyone
I don't wanna be
I don't wanna be like you
Can you tell me what you're going through?
Can you tell me reasons why?
Can you tell me that there's something new?
You might also likeCan you look me in the eye?Embed
