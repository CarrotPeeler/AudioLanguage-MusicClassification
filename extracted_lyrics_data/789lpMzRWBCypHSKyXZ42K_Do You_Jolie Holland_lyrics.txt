4 ContributorsDo You? LyricsDo you have to go crazy?
Is that the best thing that you can think to do?
I know I'm lost without a place to go crazy
I know there's a sunrise on the other side to pull me through
What did you do when I called?
Did you hear me at all?
It's a long night that seems to have no end
There's big stars falling down, down and twinkling as they fall
Do you have to go crazy?
Is that the best thing that you can think to do?
I know I'm lost without a place to go crazy
I know there's a sunrise on the other side to pull me through
What did you do when I called?
Did you hear me at all?
You motherfucker
I wanted youYou might also likeEmbed
