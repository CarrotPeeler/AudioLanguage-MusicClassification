6 ContributorsFlashback Lyrics

We're startin' up, now we're on our way
Leaving all our yesterdays behind
Something special that we wanna say
Happiness is just a state of mind

(Flashback) To the days when the nights were young
(Flashback) When we could do no wrong
(Flashback) We used to dance 'til the light of dawn
(Flashback) When our hearts were so strong, yeah


(Flashback) To the days when the nights were young
(Flashback) When we could do no wrong
(Flashback) We used to dance 'til the light of dawn
(Flashback) To when our hearts were strong

Living in the shadow of our yesterday
Memories of children in the sun
Everybody's looking back, but that don't pay
Can't you see we've only just begun?

(Flashback) When we could do no wrong
(Flashback) We used to dance 'til the light of dawn
(Flashback) When our hearts were so strong
