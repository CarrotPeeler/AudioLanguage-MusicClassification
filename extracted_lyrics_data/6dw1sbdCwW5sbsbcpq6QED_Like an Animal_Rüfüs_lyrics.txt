How long have I been on the hunt for you?
No sign of anything that I can do
But I don't mind, I don't mind
'Cause there's nothing left to lose
And for the first time, the first time
I'm calling out for you

Like an animal, I've still got love for you
And I'm coming home, I'm coming home for you
Like an animal, I've still got love for you
Hear me calling, love, I'm calling out for you
Like an animal, I've still got love for you
And I'm coming, home, I'm coming home for you

First light, washing up against the shore
Sweet love, you're the one that I adore
And I don't mind, I don't mind
If I'm running after you
It's been a long time, a long time
But know I've got the love for you

Like an animal, I've still got love for you
And I'm coming home, I'm coming home for you
Like an animal, I've still got love for you
Hear me calling, love, I'm calling out for you
Like an animal, I've still got love for you
And I'm coming home, I'm coming home for youYou might also like1Embed
