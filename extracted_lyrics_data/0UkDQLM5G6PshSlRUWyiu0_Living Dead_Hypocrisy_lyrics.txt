5 ContributorsLiving Dead Lyrics
Buried alive, I see death closing in
This is the moment of truth
Trapped in a coffin, there's nowhere to hide
Six feet under ground

I'm being punished for all my sins
But the stripes of the tiger will never go away

I crawl back to surface
You can't lock me down again
By evil I'm chosen
I am the living dead!

I've been buried alive at least a thousand times
Nothing can hold me down
There is no cure for me, I have no enemies
You're all beneath my kind

I've been punished for all my sins
But the stripes won't go away
You might also like
I crawl back to surface
You can't lock me down again
By evil I'm chosen
I am the living dead

Resurrected from the grave
I'm crawling through the dirt
Feel my wrath
Feel my hate
Resurrected from the grave!
I'm crawling through the dirt!

I crawl back to surface
You can't lock me down again
By evil I'm chosen
I am the living dead

I am the living dead!
I am the living dead!Embed
