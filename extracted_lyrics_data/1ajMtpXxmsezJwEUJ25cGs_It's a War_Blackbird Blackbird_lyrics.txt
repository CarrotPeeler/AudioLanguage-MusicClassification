What are you waiting, waiting for?
Where are you waiting?
What are you waiting, waiting for?
You were only the summer,
But you're everyone's world, everyone's world
It's a war, it's a war, it's a war
The﻿ sun coming clear
It's a war, it's a war, it's a war
It's a war, it's a war, it's a war
Where do you go?
Where nobody knows
It's a war, it's a war, it's a war
It's a war, it's a war, it's a war
It's a war, it's a war, it's a war
It's a war, it's a war, it's a war
It's a war, it's a war, it's a war
It's a war, it's a war, it's a war
Where are you waiting?
What are you waiting, waiting for?
Where are you waiting?
What are you waiting, waiting for?
Good lord, are you waiting?
What are you waiting for?
You were only the summer,
But you're everyone's world, everyone's world
It's a war, it's a war, it's a war
The﻿ sun coming clear
It's a war, it's a war, it's a war
It's a war, it's a war, it's a war
Where do you go?
Where nobody knows
It's a war, it's a war, it's a war
It's a war, it's a war, it's a war
It's a war, it's a war, it's a war
It's a war, it's a war, it's a war
It's a war, it's a war, it's a war
It's a war, it's a war, it's a warEmbed
