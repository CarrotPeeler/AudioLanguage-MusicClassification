I just want to see your face
Doing this was a big mistake
I was told we would live forever
Now I wish I could just escape
I just want to see your face
Doing this was a big mistake
I was told we would live forever
Now I wish I could just escape
I just want to see your face
Doing this was a big mistake
I was told we would live forever
Now I wish I could just escape
I came back as a hungry ghost
And my body's what I miss the most
I don't wanna live forever
I just wish I could decompose
I came back as a hungry ghost
And my body's what I miss the most
I don't wanna live forever
I just wish I could decompose

Walk in
Give him my name
Looks up and down
Takes a good look at my pecs
Puts down the clipboard
Opens the rope for my 'stache
Walk in with my duffle hanging
Hat is tilted, I'm inside
My eyes dream of bedroom surprise
They call it climbing, and i call it visibility
They call it coolness, and i call it visibility
They call it way too rowdy, and i call it finally free
Theres a girl
Her lips have never seen
She comes up
Dances on me
I look into her eyes
I say "Hey, you're not a dyke..."
She says
"I call it climbing, and you call it visibility
I call it coolness, and you call it visibility
I call it way too rowdy, and you call it finally free"
There's a slap on my back
I find another butch, hat cocked, and we
We put our hands in the crowd
And over and over
We jump up and down
They call it climbing, and we call it visibility
They call it coolness, and we call it visibility
They call it way too rowdy, and we call it finally free
(1, 2, 3, 4!)
They call it climbing, and we call it visibility
They call it coolness, and we call it visibility...

You ain't artsier than me
Cuz you got sideburns and a vintage tee
I said you ain't artiser than me
Cuz you pluck a guitar, that ain't fuckin bizarre
You ain't artsier than me
Cuz you live in Los Feliz, bitch you ain't Jesus
You ain't artsier than me
I got a colorful vocab, watch the low jab
So what you're vegan?
It shows in your presence, you be geekin'
And you been seekin' the same light
Speakin' of game like the enemy, hang tight
I got a tail about 6 foot 1 by infinity
Full of sun, rain & potential energy
All you saw were the K-Swiss
Clean, crisp, creased jeans means this
So you thought and dipped
My walks hip, thoughts; hipper
Unzip the zipper
No I don't wear hemp or drink liquor
And that don't make me the man, just a little bit sicker
Spit kicker with an eye for the big dipper
From an island cliff emerges a loud whisper
And I'm proud of this, it's my art
You doin' yoga just to look the part
You ain't artsier than me
Cuz you chop up breaks and you dig in the crates
You ain't artsier than me
You just a trendy lesbian, dreadlock thespian
You ain't artsier than me
Cuz you make weed brownies and knit wool hats
You ain't artsier than me
You pseudo-elitist old-school sap
Don't let an 808 scare ya
Shake stripes off your shirt and clear the whole area
I'm a humanoid too
And if you're cool with me then I'll look past the void in you
Instead of through
I'm down with VW's and flossed-out caddys on 22's too
I bang for good
Fools, kill for nothin'
I build for somethin'
Family and peace
Hand me the piece
I'll hit it, I'm social
Hear my opinion
I'm proud, I'm vocal
Local in a foreign place
More digital than dusty
But trust me, I be tourin' space
You be whorin' at a comfortable pace
You be skippin a chore to jump in a race
I be bumpin my bass like you collect comics
I'm not weird, I'm honest
You ain't artsier than me
Cuz you only read books, don't watch T.V
You ain't artsier than me
Cuz you shop at Whole Foods in open-toed shoes
You ain't artsier than me
Cuz you speak real soft and drink Chai tea
You ain't artsier than me
I recycle too, I'm kinda like you
I just look cleaner, grown demeanor
Wear deodorant, registered voter
And a tree hugger too
Not in these clothes
Me lova you but it's gotta be both ways
Most days I'm earthy, stay grounded
Often it's a paper chase, I'm well-rounded
Straight to face, townish
It's all boundless
I make it sound universally dope
Overcome adversity, reshape the worst of me
Do it for the love and release it commercially
Like a blockbuster started at Sundance
Can't stop man you only get one chance
Presentation is key, hesitation ain't see
Innovation is my A-R-T
Dedication is free, occupation is me
Innovation is my A-R-T...

Shake the ground
Shake the ground
Shake the ground
Shake the ground
I've been waiting
While you've been living
How do I get through to you?
Well my body's shaking
Anticipating
Trying to figure your next move
Baby, I've got to move
'Cause I'm tired of watching you
And I can't slow down
Or keep my feet on shaky ground
Slow down (Slow down)
'Cause I can't take the heat, slow down
(Ooh, slow down, baby)
Slow down (Can't stop for you)
'Cause I can't take the heat, slow down
(Slow down...ooh ooh)
Is this the part you take my heart to wipe your feet on?
(Is this the part? Oh no)
Is this the part you take my heart to wipe your feet on?
(Oh, is this-)Embed
