1 ContributorEraser Making Its Way Its Only Job LyricsStuck in the overhead
There is no exit
Wandering around
I am only living lost and found
Uncomfortable in my skin
This is how it's always been
I can't seem to make things right
I can't seem to ease my mind
More nothing than negative space
Never in solace
Only ill-at ease
I've disappearedSee Ceremony LiveGet tickets as low as $38You might also likeEmbed
