4 ContributorsI Think Itâ€™s Going to Rain Today LyricsBroken windows and empty hallways, a pale dead moon in a sky streaked with grey
Human kindness is overflowing and I think it's gonna rain today
Scarecrows dressed in the latest styles, the frozen smiles to chase love away
Human kindness is overflowing and I think it's gonna rain today
Lonely, lonely tin can at my feet
I think I'll kick it down the street
That's the way to treat a friend
Bright before me, the signs implore me, help the needy and show them the way
Human kindness is overflowing and I think it's gonna rain today
Lonely, so lonely tin can at my feet
I think I'll kick it down the street
That's the way to treat a friend
Bright before me, the signs implore me, help the needy and show them the way
Human kindness is overflowing and I think it's gonna rain todayYou might also likeEmbed
