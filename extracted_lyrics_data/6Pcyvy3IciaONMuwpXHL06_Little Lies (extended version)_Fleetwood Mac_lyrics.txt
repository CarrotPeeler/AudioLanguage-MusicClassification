2 ContributorsLittle Lies (Extended Version) Lyrics
Tell me lies

If I could turn the page
In time then I'd rearrange
Just a day or two
(Close my, close my, close my eyes)
But I couldn't find a way
So I'll settle for one day
To believe in you
(Tell me, tell me, tell me lies)

Tell me lies
Tell me sweet little lies
(Tell me lies, tell me, tell me lies)
Oh, no, no, you can't disguise
(You can't disguise, no, you can't disguise)
Tell me lies
Tell me sweet little lies

Although I'm not making plans
I hope that you understand
There's a reason why
(Close your, close your, close your eyes)
No more broken hearts
We're better off apart
Let's give it a try
(Tell me, tell me, tell me lies)
You might also like
Tell me lies
Tell me sweet little lies
(Tell me lies, tell me, tell me lies)
Oh, no, no, you can't disguise
(You can't disguise, no, you can't disguise)
Tell me lies
Tell me sweet little lies

Lie, lie, lie, lie, lies
Tell me lies

Tell me lies
Tell me sweet little lies
(Tell me lies, tell me, tell me lies)
Oh, no, no, you can't disguise
(You can't disguise, no, you can't disguise)
Tell me lies
Tell me sweet little lies

If I could turn the page
In time then I'd rearrange
Just a day or two
(Close my, close my, close my eyes)
But I couldn't find a way
So I'll settle for one day
To believe in you
(Tell me, tell me, tell me lies)
Tell me lies
Tell me sweet little lies
(Tell me lies, tell me, tell me lies)
Oh, no, no, you can't disguise
(You can't disguise, no, you can't disguise)
Tell me lies
Tell me sweet little lies
(Tell me lies, tell me, tell me lies)
Oh, no, no you can't disguise
(You can't disguise)

Tell me lies
Oh, sweet little lies
Tell me lies
Oh no, well, you can't disguise
Woah-oh
Mmm, tell me lies
Mmm, tell me lies
Mmm, little liesEmbed
