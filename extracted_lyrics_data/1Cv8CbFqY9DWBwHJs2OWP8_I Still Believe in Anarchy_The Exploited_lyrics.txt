2 ContributorsWhat if Punk Never Happened pt. II LyricsOn a warm Tuesday morning, I was walking in a town
I found one of them places where a flat whack costs 6 pound
I got a weird feeling that I been here before
Ain't that the street where the police threw Jeff to the floor?
And the Offy on the corner where we used to buy our cider
Is now a little Waitrose where one can is a fiver
And oh damn, this coffee shop is my old squat in Clapham
Let's go upstairs 'cause down here it's like punk never happened
If you can imagine, everything was still the same
Black mold on the ceiling, the floors, and ashtray
I went to take a seat at my old puke-stained mattress
Someone screamed out "What the fuck? I'm trying to nap here"
He said "I'm Paul Fox from the ruts" I said "I'm Johnny Fox"
He said
"Welcome to punk rock purgatory
See we weren't allowed into Heaven we were too high of a Hell
This is the only place we're allowed to be
So come on then, I love a good gore story
How did you die? Go on, tell me  what happened"
I said "I have a habit of stepping into alternative realities when I'm in Clapham
See we lost the class war and now squatting is outlawed
The young bands can only play if they've been asked for
There were always fifty drunk punks passed out on this floor
Now no-one can afford to live in London no more
Remember when we used to take to the streets?
We drowned out Tony Blair by blasting our beats and the
Parties afterwards we'd been thrown in the cell
We were heroes for those without the strength to yell
He said "If this is true then I have to get the bus
You ain't gonna like it you know"
You might also likeI couldn't believe who it was that walked in
I said Mister Strummer? He said call me Joe
I told him "Everyone's fighting over whos the most hardcore
That they've forgotten what it is  they'reeven  fighting for
It's become something else a century of self
It's like kids are so sadistic
Their music is shit as well
It's pathetic and elitist, it's time to facetious
They cry wolf and leave the scene over any little grievance
Watered down, diluted, no thinking we're spoon-fed
Music is the soundtrack to why we're in this excuses
Why do we never do shit? It's like we're fucking useless
The people who creating them are fucking stupid
It was punk rock that raised me, It was punk rock that saved me and
If you think I'm buying that shit then you're fucking crazy"
Joe said "Look mate, it's just how it is
Every ten years you gonna get older, complain about the kids
You talk a big talk, you got a big mouth
But what is it you're using that mouth now to talk about?"
They say don't meet your heroes 'cause now he's calling me out
I got hot and sweaty and filled with self-doubt
I fumbled for words but in the end I had to admit
Yes the scene was sanitized but I was a big part of it
I mean I let that whiskers eyes got  album
For a moment became the face of corporate punk
Center of attention, drug, booze, and women
But everything is but everything is never enough
I was fucked up for weeks it was never enough
I went weeks without sleep it was never enough
It was never about the fame, it was never about the money
I wanted everyone to look at me so fucking look at me!
Fucking look at me!
I was feeding my ego and starving my soul
I became the rockstar that I was trying to destroy and it's so gradual
You don't even realize you're losing the battle
I lost sight of my mission, I lost sight of myself
Couldn't see people around me were just trying to help
Joe just laughed and said
"Don't be so dramatic
I thought you were telling me how punk rock never happened
We've all had this crisis. Oy GG Allin, bring Sid Vicious here, and bring Paul Fox back in"
I said "Ol' Sid and GG, you'd be cancelled nowadays"
He said "What the fuck is cancelled? Grow up in the shit in his face"
I said "Sid, what about your mum who turned you into a junkie?
Didn't anyone ever suggest maybe getting some therapy?
It's easier now, you can even get it on an app
Maybe even they saved GG with thinking there was Jesus in that"
He said "Bitch what the fuck? These boy scouts are punk rockers? And if you're all thats left then well God help us"
And it dawned on me
They weren't gonna be any help and
If I wanted change I got to make it myself
I knew then that I was still on my own
My misson was clear; To build a new home
A place for the disenfranchised and the rejected
The outcasts, the weirdos, the freaks, and the dejected
So I listened to Minor Threat and I went to AA
And now I don't get fucked up nowadays
And after that I went and listened to Against Me!
And I realized I could be the person I was always meant to be
I saw an Operation Ivy, inspired by the Unity
I knew we had to get Rejects to build a new community
I listened to The Blitz, The Clash, Disorder, Propaghandi, The Exploited, NOFX
At least one of them now can't stand me
But these heroes before me, they gave me a home
And now I don't know what that home has become
But I know I'm not alone, and there are many like me
Who still believe in peace, who still believe in unity
Who still believe that those who don't fit in don't fit in fucking beautifully
Who believe that human beings are not there to be liked
Who still believe in basic human fucking rights
Who still believe in fighting for progress and change
And this punk inside yourself might be a better way
Because punk rock still has the power to change the world
It's inside every single punk rock boy and girl
Your arms through me, and your arms through you
So let's go out we got fuck all else to lose
So once again, throw your fist in the air in solidarity
And shout "Viva la punk, just one life, anarchy!"Embed
