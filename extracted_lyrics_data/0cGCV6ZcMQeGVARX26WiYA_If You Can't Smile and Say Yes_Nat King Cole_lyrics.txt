3 ContributorsIf You Canâ€™t Smile and Say Yes Lyrics(Louis Jordan, Timmie Rodgers)
Knock me a kiss, you'll never miss
When I'm ready to go
But if you can't smile and say yes
Please don't cry and say no!
Squeeze me a squoze in these fine clothes
Mmmm...I love you so
But if you can't smile and say yes
Please don't cry and say no!
When I ask for a date, the answer is no
You don't know what you're saying
Don't you know the war's on
Everything is rationed
How 'bout that jive, keep me alive?
Baby, let bygones be bygones
'Cause men are scarce as nylons
And if you can't smile and say yes
Please don't cry and say no!
Baby, let bygones be bygones
'Cause men are scarce as nylons
And if you can't smile and say yes
Please don't cry and say no, no, no, baby
Please don't cry and say noYou might also likeEmbed
