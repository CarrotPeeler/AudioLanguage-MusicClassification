Music for the masses
I’m out classed here mate
Inbetween the tashes
And splash out on shit
I’d better get a penny farthing
And Marvelous Marvin
Slam dunk with a concrete record deal
It’s bound to sink
Under the blue rule
Where the cuts make people stink
You smell

People look like emails
Wide smiles
Shut down shops couldn’t walk the paper trails
And in-house fighting
Gets the Tom, Dick and Harry smiling
Boris Johnson and the Cheeky Girls
Shut down the underground
So it’s back to orgies on the buses
Drop us a fiver mate
No worries
One pound 29 on shag all
You might also like

McFlurries

I’m gonna wee in a basin
Unleash a horrible looking vampire like James Mason
Clip the ticket
The clip-it-tick-tick
Now let me through the fucking gate you boring tit
What’s wrong with this
It’s all too much

Wobble wobble wobble
Ah get out of it
Wobble wobble wobble
Ah get out of it
Wobble wobble wobble
Ah get out of it
McFlurry

I got a Brit Award
I got a Brit Award
I got a Brit Award
I got a Brit Award
No surrender
No surrender
