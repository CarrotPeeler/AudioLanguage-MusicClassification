8 ContributorsSculpting the Throne ov Seth LyricsCome forth!
From the void beyond the stars
From the blackened shores
Thee arrive
Thou art ov gods
Yet supreme above them all
Thou art mocked and blessed
Speak ov me not as one
Speak ov me not as none
Speak ov me not at all
For I am continual
Speak ov me not as one
Speak ov me not as none
Speak ov me not at all
For I am continual
Crowned and conquering child
Cast aside the prophets
And false gods ov Thy ways
From the outer space
When TONUAL cross NAGUAL
Beyond becoming, Thou hast become
Speak ov me not as one
Speak ov me not as none
Speak ov me not at all
For I am continual
Speak ov me not as one
Speak ov me not as none
Speak ov me not at all
For I am continual

Spirit clad in gold
Seraphs incarnate
Shake loose the shackles ov a million years
Children ov Seth
Blast wide the portals
Unveil the raptures
Ov Thy kingdom
Speak ov me not as one
Speak ov me not as none
Speak ov me not at all
For I am continual
Speak ov me not as one
Speak ov me not as none
Speak ov me not at all
For I am continual
Let me reign as a God among slaves!

Io Khepesh!
Io Nubti!
Io Akhakh!
