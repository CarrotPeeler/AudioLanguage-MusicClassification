Mmm, maybe I'm a fool
For loving you so
And maybe, maybe I'm a fool
I don't, I don't really know
Mmm, but I can't
I can't stop loving you, darling, oh yes
Though I tried, oh yes
And maybe, maybe your goodbye was so mean
So mean and unfair
Though you made me cry
My love's still there
Mhm, and I know
I know that I'll long for your kisses, oh
Until I die
Oh yes, until I die

Well, I said all of my friends
All of my friends have told me
They said
"Aretha, why don't you find
You really need to find somebody new"
Yeah, oh yeah
But what they don't know
What they just don't know is in my heart
I'd missing, oh
That that someone was you
So, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
You might also like
So if you should decide
If you should decide to try me once more
All you got to do
All you got to do is knock on my door
And I'll say
I'll say that I've taken you back
If taking you back would be foolish
Then maybe, oh, maybe I'm a fool
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeahEmbed
