3 ContributorsSolid Sender LyricsYou's a solid sender, babe
Baby, you send my soul
You's a solid sender, babe
Baby, you send my soul
I lay my hands on your body, baby
You chill me, you chill me through and through
You don't wear no fine clothes, baby
And you don't, you don't, you don't look too bad
You don't wear no lipstick and powder, baby
But you send my soul, send my soul on fire
You's a natural born sender, baby
You's a natural born sender, baby
A sender, a sender
I declare you a natural born sender, baby
You send my soul, send my soul
You please me
Gave away
Mmm Mmm
You's a natural born sender, babe
Sender, sender babeYou might also likeEmbed
