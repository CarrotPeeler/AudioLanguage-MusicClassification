It's not time for us to say
Our farewell
Not to deny ourselves
From ourselves
And with the time
The season passes
Once again
Memories that hang
In autumn's wind
Memories that hang
Once again
You are
The drug in my veins
And I'm waiting
To feel it again
And I'm waiting
To feel it again, again...
Through the years
Love radiates throughout
Life's charade
Shines through everything
That remains unsaid
Shines through everything
That remains unsaid

You are the drug in my veins
And I'm waiting to feel it again, again...
You are the drug in my veins
And I'm waiting to feel it again1Embed
