1 ContributorIf You Donâ€™t Love Me Lyrics
So let's put the past behind us
Focus on what's next
When you write me off for good
Make sure that it sticks
For a while I've been under your spell
It blinded my inhibitions
So I'm keeping it from happening this time

Not just your body and your soul
It's in me to want it all
But I can't beg you to love me anymore


Not just your body and your soul
It's in me to want it all
But I can't beg you to love me anymore

Oh, the secrets you keep
All the secrets you keep

So can I ask you about the sleepless nights
The cold shoulders, never returning phone calls?
Constantly questioning our chemistry
The look I'm used to you having
You hold back all you feel
And I expect this to come back to me
