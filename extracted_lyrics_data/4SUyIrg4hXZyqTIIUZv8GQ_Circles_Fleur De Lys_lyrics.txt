3 ContributorsCircles LyricsCircles, my head is going round in circles
My mind is caught up in a whirlpool, draggin' me down
Time will tell if I'll take the homeward track
The dizziness will make my feet walk back
Walk on back to you
Everything I do, I think of you
No matter how I try, I can't get by
Circles, leading me back to you
Round and round and round
And round and round
And round and round
And round and round......
Just one thing could kill the pain, of losin' you
It gets me so dizzy that I walk right back again
Back to you
Time will tell if I'll take the homeward track
The dizziness will make my feet walk back
Walk on back to you
Down, and down and down like a pool I go
Round and round like a fool I go
Draggin' me downYou might also likeEmbed
