3 ContributorsEverywhere Lyrics
There's a place I want to go
Where the milk and honey flow
Without God, it wasn't there
Now I feel it everywhere

Feel it, feel it
Can't you feel it?

When I was lost and couldn't see my way
I used to follow what everybody say
Now I know that it's written in the heart
Now I'm ready, I'm ready to start

Without God, it wasn't there
Now I feel it everywhere

We were always meant to be
In paradise eternally
Before the truth, I did not care
Now I feel it everywhere
You might also like
Feel it
Feel it
Feel it everywhere
Feel it
Feel it

Can you feel it, feel it?
This mighty good feeling everywhere
We've got so much work to do everywhereEmbed
