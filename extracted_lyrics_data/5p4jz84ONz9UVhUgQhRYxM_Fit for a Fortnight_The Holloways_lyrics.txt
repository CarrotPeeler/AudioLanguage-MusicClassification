1 ContributorFit for a Fortnight Lyrics
Another night out
Another girl on the scene
A tart with a heart
You know the kind I mean
Tell me why it is they all study art
Underage and overdressed
I can't tell them apart

But this one other here's got a little something else
All of daddy's money and she fancies herself
Says she's 21, she's probably 16
Got a dirty mouth
At least her teeth are clean
Jack from Tennessee
Makes me think that every girl I see
Is my cup of tea

Fit for a fortnight
She ain't no good for me
Fit for a fortnight
It's such a shallow scene

Well I can't sing praise
For any of the boys
Who line up girls
Like multiple choice
Come to the club girl, I'll get you on the list
I'll get myself on you when I get you on the piss
Think we stand out from the clique
Think we're oh so unique
But the clothes that we wear
Are getting mirrored everywhere
In the morning light
She will realise
That I'm not the kind of boy that she needs
You might also like
Fit for a fortnight
That's what she said to me
Fit for a fortnight
It's such a shallow scene

Turns out that I'm not to her taste
Her fickleness was thrown back in my face

14 days since we first met
She's stopped replying to my texts
Only fools fall in love
She served my heart up on a plate
She said I passed my sell-by-date
Guess it serves me right
For all my reckless nights
Karma's come to take me out on a date

Fit for a fortnight
That's what she said to me
Fit for a fortnight
It's such a shallow scene
Turns out that I'm not to her taste
Her fickleness was thrown back in my face

Fit for a fortnight
Fit for a fortnight
Fit for a fortnight
Fit for a fortnight
Fit for a fortnightEmbed
