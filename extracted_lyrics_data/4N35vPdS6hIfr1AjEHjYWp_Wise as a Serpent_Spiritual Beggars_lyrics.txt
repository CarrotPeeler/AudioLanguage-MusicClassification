2 ContributorsWise as a Serpent LyricsWhen you think I'm going out
I will rise up again
Gonna rain on your parade
Steal your thunder, make you pray
Wise as a serpent
Hungry like a wolf
All this time I've been away
You'll be joyed, what is mine
Here I am by hand of fate
You damned fool, I pity you
Wise as a serpent
Hungry like a wolf
Wise as a serpent
Hungry like a wolf
Wise as a serpent
Hungry like a wolfYou might also likeEmbed
