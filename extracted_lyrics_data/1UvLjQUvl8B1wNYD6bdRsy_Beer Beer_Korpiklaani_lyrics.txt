2 ContributorsBeer Beer Lyrics
From evening to morning
And morning to evening
I wanna drink something stronger than a man
From evening to morning
And morning to evening
I wanna drink 'cause that's what I am

Beer beer
I want beer
From beer I get really drunk
Beer beer
I need more beer
So much I pass out

For beer I'm working
For beer I'm fighting
For beer I'll do whatever I have to
When drunk I'm talking
When drunk I'm joking
When drunk I can be as I've always wanted to be
