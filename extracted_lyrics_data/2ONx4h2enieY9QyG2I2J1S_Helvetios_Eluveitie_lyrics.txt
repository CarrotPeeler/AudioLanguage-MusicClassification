From Antumnos the life-giving winds
Fanned the flames into a blaze
The awen of the mighty
By the force of Sucellus' sledge
By every impact of Ogmios' club
With Bricta's invincible epiphany
A tribe arose
A tribe broke forth
Cause we're born free
Cause we're born wild
Cause we are indomitable and bold
Cause we are fire (brave)
Cause we are wave (strong)
Cause we are rock (tribe)
We are one - we are helvetios
The ears tethered to the divine tongue
Following the ancient wise
As laughter fills antumnos

The well that's never running dry
We wandered into the light of day
Again Taranis' enthean wheel revolved
From Antumnos life was upheaved
By the force of Succellus sledge
By every impact of Ogmios' club
With Bricta's invincible epiphany
A tribe arose
A tribe broke forth
A tribe Helvetios
A tribe Bodiacos
Cause we're born free
Cause we're born wild
Cause we are indomitable and bold
Cause we are fire
Cause we are wave
Cause we are rock
We're one - we are Helvetios
Cause we're born free
Cause we're born wild
Cause we are indomitable and bold
Cause we are brave
Cause we are strong
Cause we are tribe
We're one - we are Helvetios1Embed
