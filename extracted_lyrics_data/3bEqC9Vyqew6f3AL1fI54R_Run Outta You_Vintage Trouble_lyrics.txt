3 ContributorsRun Outta You LyricsLook what the wind
Just blew in Again
Whistling through the cracks in my door
I should’ve known, you would show up
When the cuts were not hurtin’ no more
Welcome back baby
Sit on Down
Sit on Down
Have a cup of what I have found
Since your love ain’t been around
Baby, you’ve been gone
This time too long
I’ve run outta you
Last candlelight
Flickered and died
Shining on time without you
Tell me how long, how long
Can I go on?
When you’re just gonna do what you’re gonna do
Welcome back baby
Sit on Down
Sit on Down
Have a Cup of what I have found
Since your love ain’t been around
Baby, you’ve been gone this time too long
I’ve run outta of you
You might also likeI don’t need it
It’s no good for me
I can’t bleed it
Veins gone empty
I’ll repeat it
It’s no good for me
It’s no good
No good
No good
Baby, you’ve been gone this time too long
I’ve run outta of you
Out of you
Baby, you’ve been gone this time too long
I’ve run outta of you
Hey
I’ve run outta you
I’ve run outta you
I’ve run outta you
I’ve run. out you
Oh Oh. I’ve run outta you
Out of you
I can’t take no more
I can’t break no more
Over You
