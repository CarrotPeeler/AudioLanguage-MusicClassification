Wouldn't you be mine
Wouldn't I always want the things you are
Every day or year
It's got to be a dream, yes it is, yes it is
It's got to be a dream, yes it is
Wouldn't I need yours
Wouldn't you need mine
Wouldn't I always want the things you are
Every day or year
It's got to be a dream, yes it is, yes it is
It's got to be a dream, yes it is
Wouldn't I always think about you
Wouldn't I every day
Wouldn't always think about you
Joey's in a dream
Joey's in a dream
Joey's in a dream I had today
Wouldn't I be yours
Wouldn't you be mine
Wouldn't I always want the things you are
Every day or year
It's got to be a dream, yes it is, yes it is
It's got to be a dream, yes it is
