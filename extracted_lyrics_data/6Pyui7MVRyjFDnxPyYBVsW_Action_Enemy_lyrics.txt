It happens everyday
You better watch what you say
You're gonna have to back it up somehow
Everyday, what you say
I'm not gonna let you bring this whole thing
Down

You finally found your way
You make your power play
I'm gonna have to come and take you out
Everyday, what you say
Is gonna put you to the test
Right now

I can’t believe a word that you say
I want action
I can't believe the word that you say
Without passion
Passion
That's what I want

You fought someone that wouldn’t, now there’s nothing to say
You’re sick and polluted and still be left to the stay
You sit and wonder why nothing was said
The shadows of which run through your head
So typical you need someone to hold your hand
With no-one tonight
Oh man
A murder of dumb
A matter of place
A matter of patience and that’s in your face
You might also like
I can’t believe a word that you say
I want action
Action, that’s what I want
I can’t believe a word that you say without
Passion
Passion

That’s what I want x7

Action
I want action
Action, that's what I want
Passion
I want passion
Passion, that's what I want

That's what I want x6Embed
