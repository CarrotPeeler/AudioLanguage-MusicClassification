2 ContributorsOne Said To The Other Lyrics
One said to the other
You'll never find another
Now that you're on your own
To discover, you're livin' undercover
Now that you're on your own
She's not really bothered
By a riot in Milan
Only gets excited by the cheap shot brands
Dressed up in a number
That she got from Japan
Powdered up, confident with solarium tan
You know that she won't leave here alone
She ain't ever gonna leave here alone

She's not really in touch
With the government plan
Much too busy looking
For a one night stand
You don't have to show her
Before you get to know her
She's the type who plays the fool
I don't understand
You might also likeYou know that she won't leave here alone
She ain't ever gonna leave here alone

She ain't ever gonna leave here alone
She ain't ever gonna leave here alone
She's not really bothered
By a riot in Milan
Only gets excited by the cheap shot brands
Dressed up in a number
That she got from Japan
Powdered up, confident with solarium tan
You know that she won't leave here alone
She ain't ever gonna leave here alone
Oh, you know that she won't leave here alone
She ain't ever gonna leave here alone
