3 ContributorsThem Lyrics
They're hiding in my bed
I can see 'em at the window ledge

And I can hear from across the room
But I can't get what you're doing there

And they're crawling over me
They're inside my TV

And I can hear from across the room
But I can't get what you're doing here

They're inside my TV
And crawling over me

And I can hear from across the room
But I can't get what you're doing hereYou might also likeEmbed
