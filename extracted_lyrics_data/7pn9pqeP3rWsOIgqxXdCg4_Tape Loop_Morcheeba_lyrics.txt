4 ContributorsTape Loop Lyrics
Tape loop, keeps on turnin' 'round, forever
Patience, love is comin' 'round for your pleasure
Wait now, no use tryin' to push, there's no need
People, go against the grain with their greed

I've been here before
It ain't gonna work no more
I've been here before
It ain't gonna work no more

Focus, your mind will be strong, no distractions
Soak up wisdom all year long, and then take action

I've been here before
It ain't gonna work no more
I've been here before
It ain't gonna work no more

I've been here before
It ain't gonna work no more
I've been here before
It ain't gonna work no more
I've been here before
It ain't gonna work no more
I've been here before
It ain't gonna work no moreYou might also likeEmbed
