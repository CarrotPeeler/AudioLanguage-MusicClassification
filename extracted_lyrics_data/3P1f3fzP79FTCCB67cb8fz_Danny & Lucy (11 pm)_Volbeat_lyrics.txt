8 ContributorsDanny and Lucy (11pm) Lyrics
Little Lucy out to cruise
On the road with pills and booze
Only sixteen years of age
She got her motherfucking life destroyed that day
Danny's twenty-eight
The motherfucker doing drugs and just don't care
Falling down the line, slowly losing grip of life

Dear mother, listen father
Little sister, baby brother
Read this letter, cause I'm never coming home
I'm out with Danny
'Cause I'm tired of hearing
All the broken words of a better day
I'm fine with Danny
You broke your word

Dear Mr. and Mrs. Ness
I'm so sorry to bring you this
We believe we found your girl
In an old burning car way up the hill

Dear mother, listen father
Little sister, baby brother
Read this letter, 'cause I'm never coming home
I'm out with Danny
You might also like
Dear mother, listen father
Little sister, baby brother
Read this letter, cause I'm never coming home
I'm out with Danny
'Cause I'm tired of hearing
All the broken words of a better day
I'm fine with Danny
You broke your word

I'm fine with Danny
You broke your wordEmbed
