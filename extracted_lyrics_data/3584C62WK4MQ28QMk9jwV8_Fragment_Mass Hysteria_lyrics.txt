1 ContributorIra LyricsDeconstructing all desires
By drowning them alive
AinÂ´t the world too vague a place
Amere daze within to thrive ...
Images of wrath and ire
Mankind set the world on fire
Blooms of thoughtfulness
Forgotten on the floor
Too much to set out for
But liittle to give you, too much less
Images of wrath and ire
Screams and mayherm, mass hysteria
Astray in fragments of nocturnal area
Mankind set the world on fire!
