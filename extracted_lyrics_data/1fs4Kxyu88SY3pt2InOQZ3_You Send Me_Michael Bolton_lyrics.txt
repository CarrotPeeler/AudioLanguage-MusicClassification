Darling, you send me
I know you send me
Darling, you send me
Honest you do, honest you do
Lover, you thrill me
I know you thrill me
Darling you thrill me
Honest you do, honest you do
At first I thought it was just infatuation
But oh, it's lasted for so long
Now I find myself wanting
To marry you
And take you home, wo

Darling, you send me
I know you send me
Ooh, you send me
Honest you do, honest you do

And now I find myself wanting
And take you home
