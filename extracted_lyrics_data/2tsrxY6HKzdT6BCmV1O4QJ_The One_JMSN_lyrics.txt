8 ContributorsThe One Lyrics
Christian?
Are you awake?
Can you hear me?
I gotta tell you something

Crossing a line that don’t exist
Feel like the drugs are sinking in
And I don’t wanna sail against the wind
But I feel like your tide is pulling me in

And I’m trying to make sense of it all

Something tells me that this is right
Of all the things I could take away from this
Someone tell me, if this is life
How could I have ever been so oblivious?
(All the time, you’re on my mind)
How could I have ever been so oblivious?

Say, could you be the one
That God would save my life with
Say, could you be the one
My one and only, come here
Could you be the one?

Do you love me?
Really, tell me?
Do you love me?

Trying to make sense of it all

Something tells me that this is right
Of all the things I could take away from this
Someone tell me, if this is life
How could I have ever been so oblivious?
All the time, you’re on my mind
How could I have ever been so oblivious?

Say, could you be the one
That God would save my life with
Say, could you be the one
My one and only, come here
Could you be the one?14Embed
