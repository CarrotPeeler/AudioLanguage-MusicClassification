2 ContributorsBaby Jane (Mo-Mo Jane) Lyrics
My eyes were on the sparrow, my feet were on the ground
I used to walk the straight and narrow, never fly around
'Til one night at a party I met you, Baby Jane
I was a fool to lose my cool but you drive me insane
I ain't masochistic but why do I dig the pain?

I don't know
I don't know
Mo-mo-mo Jane
You mess me up


Don't know why I'm attracted to you, I can never tell
It must be your perfume that fills the room I love to smell
You are my ruination, you knock me off my feet
I can't resist temptation thinking of your love so sweet

I don't know
I don't know
Mo-mo-mo Jane
You mess me up
You might also like
Survival of the fittеst in the forest like a tree
I might as wеll be hemlock, oh, the way you're chokin' me
The sky's getting cloudy, there's a veil over my life
Somebody help me through the fog, go cut it with a knife

I don't know
I don't know
Mo-mo-mo Jane
You mess me up


I promise we'll go places so take me for awhile
But I know that your face is wearing automatic smiles
The dream I painted on you should have been indelible ink
But it just washes off much faster than my eye can blink

I don't know
I don't know
Mo-mo-mo Jane
You mess me up

Uhh, I see you're just a baby, a human in drag
Without a heart you wander in your own private bag
And when I told you I loved you and to you I was a slave
You said you speak of things not real, so kindly do behave

I don't know
I don't know
Mo-mo-mo Jane
You mess me up

I don't know
I don't know
Mo-mo-mo Jane
You mess me upEmbed
