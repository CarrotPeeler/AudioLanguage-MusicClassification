1 ContributorThy Kingdom Gone LyricsPandemonium
For the pain that's yet to come
Fear will lead you
To the outside of the storm
Sanctimonium
For the flood is yet to come
Pain will guard you
When the water's overrun
Black horizon
For the night will bring new rain
Pale disorder
For the souls impure and sane
In the order
Of annihilation's game
Greed will lead you
And unhallowed by thy name
Dance to the beat of a broken heart
Paint with the colors of a dying art
Sing to the tunes of a fallen song
Thy kingdom gone!
Master and slave to the sun upon
Crawl on your knees when the fallout comes
Shine in the light of a fading sun
Thy kingdom gone!
You might also likeBlasphemy
Inside us all
For the end comes closer...
You walked the path of light
For all these years
So paralyzed your god
Beneath your fears
Dance to the beat of a broken heart
Paint with the colors of a dying art
Sing to the tunes of a fallen song
Thy kingdom gone!
Master and slave to the sun upon
Crawl on your knees when the fallout comes
Shine in the light of a fading sun
Thy kingdom gone!
Come sail the seas on a sinking boat
Dive to the ground in perdition mode
Thine is the earth but the loss my son
Thy kingdom gone!
Trust in the speech of a twisted tongue
Pay for a life that you don't belong
All that remains in the end is none
Thy kingdom gone!Embed
