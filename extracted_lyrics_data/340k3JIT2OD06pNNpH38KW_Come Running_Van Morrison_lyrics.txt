By the side of the tracks where the train goes by
The wind and rain will catch you, you will sigh
Deep in your heart
Then you'll come runnin' to me, mm-mm-mm
You'll come a-runnin' to me, yeah, yeah

Well you watch the train go 'round the bend
Play in dust and dream that it will never end
Deep in your heart
You'll come runnin' to me, yeah, yeah
You'll come a-runnin' to me, alright

I said, hey, come runnin' to me
Oh, come a-runnin' to me
Hey, yeah, come a-runnin' to me
Said, hey, come runnin' to me
Oh, come a-runnin' to me
Hey, yeah, come a-runnin' to me

With your hound dog by your side
And your arms stretched out open wide
I wanna keep you satisfied in the morning sun
By my side, come on, come on run
All right, hey, in the country
You might also like
You kick the sand up with your heels
Think to yourself how good it feels
Put away all your walking shoes
Then you come runnin' to me, hey, yeah
Now you come runnin' to me, mm, mm-mm

I said, hey, come runnin' to me
Oh, come a-runnin' to me
Hey, yeah, come a-runnin' to me
Hey, come runnin' to me
Oh, come a-runnin' to me
Hey, yeah, come a-runnin' to me

Oh, come on, come on run (Hey, come a-running to me)
Wanna run, come on run (Oh, come a-running to me)
Oh, come on run (Hey, yeah come a-running to me)
(Hey, yeah come a-running to me)
Come on, run to me
You gotta rainbow if you run to meEmbed
