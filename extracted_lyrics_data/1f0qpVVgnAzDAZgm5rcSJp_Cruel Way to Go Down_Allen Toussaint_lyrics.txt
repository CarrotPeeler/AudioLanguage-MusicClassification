4 ContributorsCruel Way to Go Down LyricsLoneliness makes its way around
And loneliness
Must be a cruel way to be found
Lost and found in the sea of love
And tossed around
Must be a cruel way to go down, down
Loneliness makes its way around
And loneliness
Must be a cruel way to go down
Down, down, down
Must be a cruel way to go downYou might also likeEmbed
