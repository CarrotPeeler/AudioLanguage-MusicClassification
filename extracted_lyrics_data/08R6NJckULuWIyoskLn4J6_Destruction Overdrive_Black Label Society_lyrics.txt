3 ContributorsDestruction Overdrive LyricsForever rolling on, the wars we wage unknown
Eternal is the blessed end...
Destruction overdrive, disregard of life
Obsessed throughout the end of time, oh yeah
Throughout the end of time!
Throughout the end of time (repeat)
The masses gather 'round
The drug of choice is found
The hate machine keeps moving on, oh yeah
It keeps rolling on... It keeps moving on (x2)
It keeps moving (x4) It keeps moving on, oh yeah
Oh yeah...
-Destruction overdrive!
-Destruction overdrive (- repeat x3)
Destruction overdrive!
Destruction over...You might also likeEmbed
