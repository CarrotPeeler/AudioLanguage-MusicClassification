It won't take long
And if we use our hearts
We can't go wrong
Let's make our love song
Make it out of sight
Turn up the volume
And let's dance all night
Let's make our love song
Don't be late
You take the keyboard
And the 808
I'll do the buggles
And the 909
And in the end
It will work out fine
It'll be our song
Ba bum bum bum
And our love will grow
Grow
Grow
Oh oh oh
You might also likeWe can clap our hands
To set the pace
You control the treble
And I'll take the bass
Let's make our love song
Let's not delay
We'll work all night
And sleep all day
But when we wake
The sun will set
We'll then lean over
And play the cassette
It'll be our song
Bum bum bum bum
And our love will grow
Grow
Grow
Oh oh oh
Let's make our love song
And when we're done
Send it round the world
For everyoneEmbed
