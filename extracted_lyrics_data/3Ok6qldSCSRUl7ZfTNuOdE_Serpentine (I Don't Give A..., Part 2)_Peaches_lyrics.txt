4 ContributorsSerpentine (I Don’t Give A..., Pt. 2) Lyrics
Uh-uh
Uh-uh
Uh-uh
Uh-uh
Uh-uh
Uh-uh
Uh-uh
Uh-uh

I dined and dashed on electroclash
I bat my lash and outlast the backlash
Fuck that past that passed so fast
I snatch that gas and rise from the ash
Some call me trash, some call me nasty
Call me crass but you can't match me
I'm a smash on me like a parrot
Staring at my ass and my beard and my mustache
Uh-uh
Uh-uh
Uh-uh
Uh-uh

Hair in a mullet
You know you gotta love it
So sexual and so conceptual
Figure me out trying to catch a bout
Contagious, outrageous, courageous crank 'em
I'm on your big feet like airport security
Looking complete then I'm in obscurity
Fuck maturity, got a big bad brain
And my champagne stain as I yank your chain
You might also like
I don't give a fuck if you're calling me
I don't give a fuck if you're mauling me
I don't give a fuck if you fall for me
I don't give a fuck if you're following me
Serpentine serpentine
Never a straight line serpentine
Serpentine serpentine
Never a straight line serpentine
Uh-uh
Uh-uh
Uh-uh
Uh-uh
Uh-uh
Uh-uh
Uh-uh
Uh-uh

Corazón de Melocotón
J'ai la Pêche or call me Pfirsich
Perzik, Afarseqim
Momo with a side of cream
Pêssego 'cause I say so
Touch me and I'll give you impetigo
Pesca, Breskva, Peachy's so worldwide
Pesca fresca, Peachy's so worldwide
I don't give a fuck if you're calling me
I don't give a fuck if you're mauling me
I don't give a fuck if you fall for me
I don't give a fuck if you're following me
Serpentine serpentine
Never a straight line serpentine
Serpentine serpentine
Never a straight line serpentine
Uh-uh
Uh-uh
Uh-uh
Uh-uh
Uh-uh
Uh-uh
Uh-uh
Uh-uh

I don't give a fuck if you're calling me
I don't give a fuck if you're mauling me
I don't give a fuck if you fall for me
I don't give a fuck if you're following me
I don't give a fuck if you're calling me
I don't give a fuck if you're mauling me
I don't give a fuck if you fall for me
I don't give a fuck if you're calling me
I don't give a fuck if you're calling me
I don't give a fuck if you're mauling me
I don't give a fuck if you fall for me
I don't give a fuck if you're following me
Serpentine serpentine
Never a straight line serpentine
Serpentine serpentine
Never a straight line serpentineEmbed
