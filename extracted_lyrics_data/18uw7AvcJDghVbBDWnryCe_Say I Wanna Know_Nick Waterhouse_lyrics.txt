1 ContributorSay I Wanna Know LyricsHave you ever
Made the best of a bad situation
Maybe, gone and takin'
Somethin' yours for the takin'
Have you ever... Felt trapped
Like you... wanted to stop
Like you... not even gonna make it
Past the corner of the block
Say, I wanna know
Say, I wanna know
Say, I wanna know
Say, I wanna know
Oh there'll be times
That this ol' world can be so demanding
It get hard to find
A little truth 'n understanding
Have you ever... Felt trapped
Like you wanted to stop
Like you...
Not even gonna make
Past the next city cop
Say, I wanna know
Say, I wanna know
Say, I wanna know
Say, I wanna know

He trying and he wanna know
She's trying and she wanna know
We trying and we wanna know
We trying and we wanna know
We trying and we wanna know
Say, I wanna know
Say, I wanna know
Say, I wanna know
Say, I wanna knowEmbed
