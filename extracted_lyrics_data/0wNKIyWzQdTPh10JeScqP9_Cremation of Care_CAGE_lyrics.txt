2 ContributorsCremation Of Care LyricsIt took me way too long
2 fkn find myselff
“where did she go?”
Im crying all by myselfff
& nobody knows
Of how i sold my soul
Im bleeding out in, designer clothes
I must ask u a question
Who is it that uu worship?
Ik ur heart is hurting
My pineal crystalss burning
& my teeth heart from gurning
Ik one things for certain
Gaf abt the cost
Im sick of feeling worthless
I dnt wnna hurt myself anymore
All that self hate shits so tired & so bored
Blood & guts spilled on checkered floors
Babylon on my hands coz i h8 whores
My fingertips reach out just like branches
Bloody tears falling off my lashes
I need a fkn baptist like it’s my last wish
All my regrets i can leave in the past tense
Lеave em in the past tеnse

Hopeless romantic
Owls keep silent
Vanish just like magick
Phantom of the opera
Sweety im th holy ghost
Offer up my cares at Bohemian Grove
Hide my face in my furr coat
Heart burried in the snow
Jesus won't u touch me?
I need to feel u so close
& when the moon kisses the sun
Tell me what uu running from
I need my bible & a gun
Fuck my brain until it cums
Im eating frm the qulippoth
Even if it makes me rot
Im crying in the bathtub
Im cutting crosses in my arms
I took it way too far
& theres no turning back
My traumatic past
Watch me throw it all in the trash
Purify me, burn me
Like an effigy
Im so sick of rotting
Chalice empty
Fill me
Theres nothing left inside me
Nail my wrists to the sephirot tree
All my sins keep onn haunting me
Blood of Christ wash over me
I need sweet lobotomy
Lovely angels eclipse meEmbed
