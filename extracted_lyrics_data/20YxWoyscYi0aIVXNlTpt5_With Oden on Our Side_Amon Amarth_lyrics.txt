9 ContributorsWith Oden on Our Side LyricsFinally the storm arrives
Our wait is at an end
Under dark winter skies
We make our final stand
For each of us there are four of them
It matters not to us
We won't leave this field in shame
We are here to crush
Futile to resist
You know why we have come
Futile to resist
The battle is already won
Futile to resist
You know why we have come
Futile to resist
The battle is already won
Our hearts are full of pounding rage
Our minds hard as steel
And before the dying day
We will have you kneel
The snow turns red from all the blood
Severed limbs and heads
A sacrifice to one eyed god
He will claim the dead
You might also likeUnder winter skies
We stand glorious
And with Oden on our side
We are victorious
No retreat, no remorse
Victory will be ours
Blood on steel, sacrifice
Victory will be ours
Under winter skies
We stand glorious
And with Oden on our side
We are victorious
Futile to resist
You know why we have come
Futile to resist
The battle is already won
Futile to resist
You know why we have come
Futile to resist
The battle is wonEmbed
