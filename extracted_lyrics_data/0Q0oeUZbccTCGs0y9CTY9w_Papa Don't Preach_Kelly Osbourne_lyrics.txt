Papa, I know you're going to be upset
'Cause I was always your little girl
But you should know by now, I'm not a baby
You always taught me right from wrong
I need your help, daddy, please be strong
I may be young at heart, but I know what I'm saying

The one you warned me all about
The one you said I could do without
We're in an awful mess
And I don't mean maybe
Please

Papa don't preach
I'm in trouble, deep
Papa don't preach
I've been losing sleep
But I made up my mind, I'm keeping my baby
Ooh, I'm gonna keep my baby, oh

He says that he's going to marry me
And we can raise a little family
Maybe we'll be all right, it's a sacrifice
You might also like
But my friends keep telling me to give it up
Saying I'm too young, I oughta live it up
What I need right now is some good advice
Please

Papa don't preach
I'm in trouble, deep
Papa don't preach
I've been losing sleep
But I made up my mind, I'm keeping my baby
Ooh, I'm gonna keep my baby, ooh

Daddy, daddy, if you could only see
Just how good he's been treating me
You'd give us your blessing right now
'Cause we are in love
We are in love, so please

Papa don't preach
I'm in trouble, deep
Papa don't preach
I've been losing sleep
But I made up my mind, I'm keeping my baby
Ooh, I'm gonna keep my baby, oh
Don't stop loving me, daddy
I know, I'm keeping my baby
Don't stop loving me, daddy
I know, I'm keeping my babyEmbed
