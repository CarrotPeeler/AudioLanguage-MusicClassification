2 ContributorsMy Darling Curse LyricsWaiting here I'll prepare and
Try my best not
To be scared
There's no need
To insist
'cause I'm too dumb to even resist
Anymore
And anyhow
Anywhere you go, I will go with you
My darling curse...
It's you and me versus the world
If I don't lose my nerve
Then we'll get
What
We
Deserve
Well all this time I've climbed the walls
I've never gained an inch at all
My broken heart won't restart
Whatever I read in my chart...
So take your time and don't be too late
'Cause my last flare's already in the air
You might also likeMy darling curse...
It's you and me versus the world
If I don't lose my nerve
Then we'll both
Get
What
We
Both
Deserve...
Might be each other...
Could be each other...Embed
