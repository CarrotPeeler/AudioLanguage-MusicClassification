3 ContributorsThis Train Lyrics
Everybody has a price
Everybody has a price
But sometimes the price doesn't always mean money

Tell me who is running this game
Check the roles I wanna know who's riding this train
Tell me who is running this game
Check the roles I wanna know who's riding this train

It feels like each day crawls along
Can only see the wrong in a situation
As the picture's playing
No dedication or conviction in what I'm saying
Weight laying heavy on my soul
Invisible
Manage to keep it moving
But don't know who's in control
Life used to be so beautiful
Could appreciate
How the sun illuminates the smallest thing
And motivates the birds to sing at the crack of dawn
At the crack of dawn
Spread their wings
And take on a new flight before the night falls
Calls them back to sleep
So they retreat under the sheet of indigo
That glows from the harvest moon
I paint a picture with this tune
And connect with everyone in the room
Who wears a smile over their gloom
Trying to sweep it to the corner with a broom
And yet the melancholy looms
Secretly anticipating its finale soon
It has to let up, before I give up

Tell me who is running this game
Check the roles I wanna know who's riding this train
Tell me who is running this game
Check the roles I wanna know who's riding this train

We're supposed to be so strong
Instead of fragile creatures who admit their weakness
Reaching out for help when times are bleakest
We hold it in and pretend
It's the opposite of what we think it is
Instincts, inset for a reason
To avoid is treason
Involution's own means of prevention
Keeping you from tasting the poison
It's natural selection
Yet intelligence is testing boundaries
Why am I chasing "happy" when I have companionship
Success and money
All the things I thought would fill the empty
But now it runs its course so deep inside of me
I silently scream in agony
While my friends and family watch on happily
They can't see the clouds above me
Overcast, blocking sunny
I laugh it off like it's funny
Who wants to be the lone wolf feeling crummy
Forget the front 'cause actually
You and me may not feel so differently
Tell me who is running this game
Check the roles I wanna know who's riding this train
Tell me who is running this game
Check the roles I wanna know who's riding this trainEmbed
