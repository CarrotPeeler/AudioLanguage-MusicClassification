5 ContributorsDown in Mississippi LyricsAs far back as I can remember
I either had a plow or hoe
One of those long olâ€™ nine-foot sacks
Standing at the old turn row

Way down in Mississippi
Down in Mississippi
Down in Mississippi where I was born
Down in Mississippi where I come from
They had a hunting season on the rabbit
If you shoot him you went to jail
Season was always open on me
Nobody needed no bail

I remember, I used to walk down that gravel road, walking with my grandma
Mississippi sun, beaming down
I went to get some water
My grandma said, young un, you can't drink that water
She said you drink from that fountain over there, heha
And that fountain had a sign
Said for colored only
I was so glad I had my grandma and my papa
No, I won't leave you out, Grandpa
My grandpa was so proud of me, y'all
I went down in Forest, Mississippi one time
Didn't know no better, but I integrated
A washateria
He was telling everybody, my grandbaby Mavis
She went up in that washateria, and washed some clothes
And all the black ladies followed her on up in there
I'm proud of my grandbaby
I saw many more of those signs as I lived in Mississippi
I'm so glad I can say that I saw every one of those signs
Dr. King saw that every one of those signs got taken down
Down in Mississippi
