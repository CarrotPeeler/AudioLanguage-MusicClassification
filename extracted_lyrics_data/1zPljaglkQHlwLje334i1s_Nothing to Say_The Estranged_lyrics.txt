Hey, sister
You sound so estranged
Under the small talk
There's nothing to say
Hey, I know what you don't know
What you don't know

Oh, but I'm fine
I feel I'm flying
Please keep me in mind
When I try
You say something demonic but still lighthearted
I say a waste of your time
Everyone's in mind

Well I try
Well I
Please keep me in mind

Hey, sister
I feel so afraid
You say the secret's bloody 
 better days
Hey, you've gotta work now
Feel like  now
You might also like
No, but I'm fine
Hey, I'm fine
Well I try
I feel so inclined
To keep in mind
You spеak in four different accents
And say thе same thing twice

Well I try, oh boy
Well I
Please keep me in mind
When I try, you say
When I
Please keep me in mind

Hey, sister
Did you hear?
Sister, did you?
Hey, sister
Did you hear?
Sister, did you?
Hey, sister, sister, sister, sister
Hey, sister
Yeah, I'm fine
How are you?
Yeah, I'm fine
How 'bout you?
Yeah, I'm fine
How 'bout--
I just can't wait to be-- I just can't wait
I just can't wait to be anywhere but here
Maybe when the family moves 
I just can't wait to be anywhere but here
Yeah, I'm fine, yeah, I'm fine, yeah
Yeah I'm fine, oh boy
Well I
Please keep me in mind
Well I try
You say something demonic and still lighthearted
Well I, well I, well I
Keep me in mind
Please keep me in mind
Please keep me in mindEmbed
