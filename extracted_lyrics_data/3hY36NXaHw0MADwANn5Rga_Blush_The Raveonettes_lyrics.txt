All I want from you is everything
I ever wanted for just one night
And all I care for is for you to leave
Me alone when the morn comes
Take everything we had
Away from you and you away from me

I can't keep you
I can't hold you tight
I can't lull you to sleep
Despite my hurtful ways
I can still make you blush

Tremble lips speak sound screams
Lover's death it's time you leave
And all I want from you is all I took

I can't keep you
I can't hold you tight
I can't lull you to sleep
Despite my hurtful ways
I can still make you blush

I can't keep you
I can't hold you tight
I can't lull you to sleep
Despite my hurtful ways
I can still make you blushEmbed
