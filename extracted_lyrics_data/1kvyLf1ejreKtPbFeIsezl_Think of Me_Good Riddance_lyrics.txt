2 ContributorsThink of Me LyricsI never knew how good i had it
I had to treat you like a habit
It became what I'd guess you call a slight obsession
Now I've had some time to work it out
Way too much time to be without
The one I wanted
You're my right direction
When you're back there
Do you think of me?
When you're alone
Before you sleep
You are the one I'm waiting for
This time's not like before
I'm going to carry you away
Carry you away
Thinking good things now
I know we'll work it out somehow
I try to keep my chin up
But it's so hard to let you go
It never hurt before to be alone
Now your voice is salvation on the phone
I only wish you weren't so far away
When you're back there
Do you think of me?
When you're alone
Before you sleep
You are the one I'm waiting for
This time's not like before
I'm going to carry you away
Carry you awayYou might also likeEmbed
