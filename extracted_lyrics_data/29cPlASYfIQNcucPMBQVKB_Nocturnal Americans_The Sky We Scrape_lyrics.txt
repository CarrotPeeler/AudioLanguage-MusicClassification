1 ContributorNocturnal Americans LyricsIt's hard to talk / tongues between teeth
I lost my way so I'll be brief
I've begun to disagree with this breed of violent peace
Dialogue and the debate / Good things will come along - just wait
System coats you like a shell / What you need nobody sells
Our love for this goes so far back / I missed the train in seconds flat
And the lights of passing cars are still rolling thru the park
Portrait hangs in empty hearts / From the places where they start
In no harmony no matter where we go
Why do your dreams come from the magazine
And you're not to blame / the wasted man
Ripple in a water can
Night birds scatter, last call pleading
Can we make a late night house call?
We don't look so good tonight
We're the kings of midnight runs
Cell phones, guns, and rolled up ones
Desperate but don't despair - make the call and Merv is there
Bloody Mary's on the phone - she never wants to be along
We're gonna bring you back to life again
One by one they always call / High they stand and down the fall
You don't look so bad to me tonight
We will save the night again / Plastic bags for plastic friends
I've got your medicine tonight
Why do your dreams come from this magazine
And you're not to blame / the wasted man
Ripple in a water can
Night birds scatter, last call pleading
Can we make a late night house call?
We don't look so good tonightYou might also likeEmbed
