I dine, strawberry cream
Falling from blue dreams forever
So just sing once more
Falling for  forever
I'll dine, strawberry cream
Heaven-sent, blue  streams to 
So just sing once more
I've been waiting
For more than just a little more
I've been waiting
For more than just a little more
I've been waiting
For more than just a little more
I've been waiting
For more than just a little more
Everything, everything
Evеrything, everything
Everything, еverything
Everything, everything
