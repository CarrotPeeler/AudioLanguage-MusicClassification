2 ContributorsIgnant and Shit LyricsYeah
Come here, sit down at the table
I wanna talk to you
I wanna see if I can not develop some kind of understanding
It is with great enthusiasm that I reenact the ? capabilities that becomes my indignation
And if the collar on my backbone is too high for your understanding
Then you take it out and ? do a gymnastic
I gotta get down to the nitty gritty and I mean I'm talking about those nipples you have, you call them titties
You are ignant and you been out here on the street talking that ignant ass shit
Now here I am about to try to straighten you out and get this mess together so nobody think we a bunch of fools down here throwing a fit
And the first thing I want to lay on you, is don't sit on that porch eatin' watermelon
It's bad enough every time somebody pass the street you're blowin' seeds clear across on the other side of the side walk
You must think yo jaws are some kind of machine gun
If you gotta eat the seeds bring 'em on down, baby
Eat the rind and eat the whole damn thing
I mean, as ignant as you are and as uneducated as you are
When you talk that ignant shit ain't nobody gonna pay it no mind
'cause they think you crazy anyhow
And don't lay no more mess on me about your mother
That's the only woman I know that wears a corset, a girdle, and a chastity belt at the same time
At her age, she should have a muzzle on her mouth
Yes she is a nice woman, she can cook good food
But you gotta wake up baby
Now listen, look at this picture
We took this last week when we stopped by the zoo
And a gorilla fell in love witchu
You thought he looked like Errol Flynn
And you got mad 'cause he couldn't get it in
Why, you uneducated, tall, Empire Building State, baboon, talkin' that uneducated, ignant shit
I can't have no much more of that
You might also likeAnd last night, last night almost took the cake
'cause the police damn near put me in jail
All they wanna do is smell my breath to see if ive been taking drugs or drinking alcohol
But you over there talking that ignant ass shit
Which caused him to take me out, put my hands up in the air and search me, read me my rights
I damn near was in jail and you couldn't come up with the bail
You gotta shut up witcho ignant self
Talkin' dat ignant ass shit with yo un-edu-educated mouth
Now you get together and do it right
And you can't go barbecuing every Sunday using the neighborhoods pets
You know, fry the fellas
You've skinned the damn dog
You skinned the cat
You skinned the pigeons and you skinned the rats
Ain't nobody gonna eat no ribs coming outta sum that looks worse than they do
You understand what I said?
I wantcha to take a shower
Take a bath, take a spoon
And scrape that funk from under yo armpits
Stand up, spread yo toes
And get yourself a fingernail file
And pick the scales out between your toes with all that mustard
The only time in my life I ever seen enough funk that smelt like black mustard, custard
Uneducated, ignant shit, that's what it's all about
See yo teeth? They're green
You got fungus, baby, growin' in your gums
You gotta go to a dentist to get a haircut
I don't want everybody to know our business
You gotta get together
And that dog down the street
You'd think it's somethin' funny
When you comin' back home from the store
And that dog is still wrapped around your ankle humpin' and a-pumpin'
Like he got himself a good piece
Your leg ain't meant to be part of some damn dogs sexual appetite
Gettin' sick of that mess
You uneducated talkin' that ignant shit
I love ya baby, but I just can't take it
You uneducated and you be talkin' that ignant shit
And I be actin' like I'm gon' blow a fit
We gotta get apart 'cause it's breakin' my heart
You be talkin' that ignant ass shit
Goodbye, goodbye
Don't ?, don't lie
I'll leave while my heart's on my sleeve
You talkin' that ignant, ignant shit
I gotta go, I gotta go
You uneducated, ignant shitEmbed
