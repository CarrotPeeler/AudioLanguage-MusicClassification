2 ContributorsWhen We Fall LyricsWhen we fall we will pick up the pieces
We know that we'll never be down for too long
When we fall down we must realize
It's a temporary state we must overcome
With no regrets, there's no defeat
These obstacles mean nothing to me
We won't give up, we won't give in
We'll keep on fighting until the end
Get up, stand tall
You gotta fight for it all
When we fall we will pick up the pieces
We know that we'll never be down for too long
This is your life, don't second guess
Or your future will come to its death
If you moan, bitch or complain
At the bottom is where you'll remain
When we fall we will pick up the pieces
We know that we'll never be down for too long
When we fall
That's right when we fall
Don't count us out
We have the power to stand up again
Just because failure
Preys on the weak
Doesn't mean you gotta stay down
You might also likeStand up, stand tall
Through your defeat
We have the power to stand up again
Our dreams stand above it all
When we fall we will pick up the pieces
We know that we'll never be down for too longEmbed
