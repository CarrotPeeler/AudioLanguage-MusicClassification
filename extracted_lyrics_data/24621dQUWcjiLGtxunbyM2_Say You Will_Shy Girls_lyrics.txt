3 ContributorsSay You Will Lyrics(Verse 1)
Inch by inch, you drift apart
You feel it
Every night we lose our charge
You fear the
(Pre-chorus 1)
Where's the touch?
Nothing left to hit or feel
Lost your pulse
Watching the light disappear
All alone, on a stage screaming
Caged up, screaming
Echoes ain't leaving
(Chorus)
There's no shadow behind you
Empty eyes when you look at me
Always saying you will
If you say you will (say you will)
If you say you will, mean you will
I can't fake it like you do
I can't sing it with a forked tongue
Always saying you will
If you say you will (say you will)
If you say you will, mean you will
(Verse 2)
Lost our spark to the power lines
No feelings
Hiding love in the table wine
No feelings
(Pre-chorus 2)
We stay drunk
Rather drown than keep it real
Just a front
Mimic how we used to feel
All alone, on a stage screaming
Caged up, screaming
Echoes ain't leaving
(Chorus)
There's no shadow behind you
Empty eyes when you look at me
Always saying you will
If you say you will (say you will)
If you say you will, mean you will
I can't fake it like you do
I can't sing it with a forked tongue
Always saying you will
If you say you will (say you will)
If you say you will, mean you will
You might also likeIf you say you will, mean you will
If you say you will, mean you will
(Pre-chorus 2)
We stay drunk
Rather drown than keep it real
Just a front
Mimic how we used to feel
All alone, on a stage screaming
Caged up, screaming
Echoes ain't leaving
(Chorus)
There's no shadow behind you
Empty eyes when you look at me
Always saying you will
If you say you will (say you will)
If you say you will, mean you will
I can't fake it like you do
I can't sing it with a forked tongue
Always saying you will
If you say you will (say you will)
If you say you will, mean you willEmbed
