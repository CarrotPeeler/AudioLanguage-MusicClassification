14 ContributorsPerfume-V Lyrics
Fun for an hour when the hour's gone
Can a one trick night feed 40 days?
And in my bed at the break of dawn
She shivered like a vein slashed bright and new

She's got the radio active
And it makes me feel okay
I don't feel okay
She's got the radio active
And it makes me feel okay
I don't feel okay

Grip force the vials and strip the locks
Smash the set and slash the beds
And when it looks like a wife's ex-plot
We'll cover all the rugs with cheap perfume

She's got the radio active
And it makes me feel okay
I don't feel okay
She's got the radio active
And it makes me feel okay
I don't feel okay
You might also like
Like a docent's lisp
(She's got the radio active)
Like a damsel's spin
Like a dry gin's twist
(And it makes me feel okay)
Of lime
(I don't feel okay)
Like a poor old serf
(She's got the radio active)
Like a poke's old spurs
Like a pastor's flock
(And it makes me feel okay)
No church
(I don't feel okay)2Embed
