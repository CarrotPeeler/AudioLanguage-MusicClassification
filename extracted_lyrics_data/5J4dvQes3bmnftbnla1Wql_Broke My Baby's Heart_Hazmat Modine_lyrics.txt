1 ContributorBroke My Babyâ€™s Heart LyricsI broke my baby's heart
Went off with someone else
Broke my baby's heart
I went off with someone else
Well it's too bad, a shame
I can't blame noboby but myself
My baby won't stop crying
Unless I be her boy
My baby won't stop crying
Ha, huh, unless I be her boy
I will turn those tears of sorrow
Into happy, happy days for you all?
I say there's no love like my love
Fix your heart again
No love like my love
Oh, to fix your heart again
Remove those tears of sorrow
All of your heartache and pain
I broke my baby's heart
Went off with someone else
Broke my baby's heart
I went off with someone else
Well it's too bad, sad
I can't blame nobody but myself

I broke my baby's heart
Went off with someone else
Broke my baby's heart
I went off with someone else
Well it's too bad
Too sad
Well, too bad
(High falsetto wail)
Ain't gonna be free?
Hang on to this bill?
Hang on to this bill now now?
(Man doing a woman's voice)
I'm going to take you to the top
I'm going to take you to the city
With light shining down from?
(High falsetto wail)

This one night I very slowly started to wake up and I was down on my living room floor with all of these wires and stuff and I was down on my hands and knees and I was so excited because I thought aliens had abducted me. So I thought all of these car parts I had down on the floor were part of the space ship. Maybe a minute later I realized I was down the floor with Charlie's car partsEmbed
