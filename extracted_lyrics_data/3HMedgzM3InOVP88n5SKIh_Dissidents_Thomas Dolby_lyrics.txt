6 ContributorsDissidents Lyrics
One more young writer slid away in the night
Over the border he will drown in light

(And the man said)
Hold it (hold it)
(He said)
Wait a minute (wait a minute)
I can't read my writing

My own writing
Like tiny insects (my writing)
In the palm of history (my writing)
A domino effect (my writing)
In a cloud of mystery (my own writing)
Is an iron fist (my writing)
In a glove full of Vaseline (my writing)
Dip the fuse in the kerosene (my own writing)
I too became a dissident
Became a dissident
Became a dissident

Courting disaster we ran in the night
Wings of an angel were torn in flight

(When the man said)
Check it (hold it)
(He said)
Verify it (wait a minute)
It's all here in writing

My own writing
Like tiny insects (my writing)
In the palm of history (my writing)
A domino effect
And an early end to the story (my writing)
Is an iron fist (my writing)
In a glove full of Vaseline (my writing)
Dip the fuse in the kerosene (my own writing)
I too became a dissident
Became a dissident
Became a dissident

Check it
Said, verify it
It's all here in writing

Down in writing
At the hands of the press (my writing)
And in the eyes of the government (my writing)
I fell from grace (my writing)
I too became a dissident
I was a dissident, yeah
Like tiny insects (my writing)
In the palm of history (my writing)
A domino effect
And an early end to the story (my writing)
Is an iron fist
In a glove full of Vaseline
Dip the fuse in the kerosene
I too became a dissident
Became a dissident
A dissi-, a dissi-, a dissi-1Embed
