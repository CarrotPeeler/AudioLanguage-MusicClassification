There are some things
I may not know
There are some places
That I can't go
I know it is
But I am sure
Of His love, He love me so, I know He do

My God is real
For I can feel
Him in my soul

My God is real
Real in my soul, yes He is
For he has a washed and cleansed
And made me whole
Let me say that His love for me
Is like pure gold
I can tell, I can tell

My God is real
For I can feel
Him in my soul

Hey hey, my God is real, yes He is
I can feel it, down in my soul
Every time I think about it, it's so real
I can feel itEmbed
