This magic moment
So different and so new
Was like any other
Until I kissed you
And then it happened
It took me by suprise
I knew that you felt it, too
By the look in your eyes

Sweeter than wine
Softer than a summer night
Everything I want, I have
Whenever I hold you tight

This magic moment
While your lips are close to mine
Will last forever
Forever, 'til the end of time
Whoa, whoa
Forever, 'til the end of time

You might also like
Sweeter than wine (Sweeter than wine)
Softer than a summer night
(Softer than a summer night)
Everything I want, I have
Whenever I hold you tight

This magic moment
While your lips are close to mine
Will last forever
Forever, 'til the end of time
Whoa, whoa, whoa

Magic moment, ooh, hey
Magic moment
Magic moment, whoa
Sweeter than wine
Whoa, whoaEmbed
