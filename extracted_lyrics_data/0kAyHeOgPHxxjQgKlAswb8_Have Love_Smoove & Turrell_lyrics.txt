2 ContributorsHave Love LyricsYou gave your everything
But the truth's still gonna hurt
Ain't talking on futures child
How you act on what you learnt?
And then if you learned your lesson
The pain is what it's worth
Ooh, and it's gonna get rough
That's why we're put down on the earth
So have hope, what we believe in
So have love, still got the feeling
Everything that you worked for
Don't let it slip away
Well this love's a tough game y'all
But I guess we all should play
Ain't no love like the real thing
Ain't no feeling when it's gone
It's a space we've all been in
It's a bridge we gotta cross
So have hope, what we believe in
So have love, still got the feeling
So have hope, what we believe in
So have love, still got the feeling

Get down get down with love?
So you want to get down with love
Get down get down with love?
(Repeat x4)
So have hope, so have love
So have hope, what we believe in
So have love, still got the feeling
So have hope, what we believe in
So have love, still got the feeling
So have hope, what we believe in
So have love, still got the feeling
So have hope, what we believe in
So have love, still got the feeling
So have hope, so have loveEmbed
