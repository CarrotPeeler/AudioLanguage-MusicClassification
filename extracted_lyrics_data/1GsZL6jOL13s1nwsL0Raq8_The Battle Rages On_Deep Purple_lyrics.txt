7 ContributorsThe Battle Rages On Lyrics
Been so many words so much to say
Words are not enough to keep the guns at bay
Some live in fear some do not
Some gamble everything on who gets the final shot

Oh, don't talk to me of love
It's obvious it's not enough

Annihilation, kill them all
Capitulation, watch the mighty fall
The road to glory is lined in red
And though the reason now is gone
The battle rages on

Was it love or hate that got here first
Hate's a habit, it's hard to shake the curse
Kill to live and live to die
Human nature, you let the strong survive

Oh, don't talk to me of love
It's obvious it's not enough
You might also like
Annihilation, kill them all
Capitulation, watch the mighty fall
The road to glory is lined in red
And though the reason now is gone
The battle rages on


Annihilation, kill them all
Capitulation, watch the mighty fall
The road to glory is lined in red
And though the reason now is gone
Annihilation, kill them all
Capitulation, watch the mighty fall
The road to glory is lined in red
And though the reason now is goneEmbed
