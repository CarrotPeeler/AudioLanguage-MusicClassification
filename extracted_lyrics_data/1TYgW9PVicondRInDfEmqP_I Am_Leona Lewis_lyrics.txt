18 ContributorsI Am Lyrics
I thought the moment I was leaving, barely breathing
I'd fall to pieces, couldn't face this
Why would I be leaving?
I was believing it's you and me against the world
Not saying I was afraid of you
Won't put the blame on you
But I won't change for you
Just when you thought you'd drop me
I gotta drop the news, I'm still existing
I'm still here

I am with or without you
I am breathing without you
I am somebody without you
I am, I am
I am free without you
I am stronger without you
Thought I would never rise again
But I am, I am

First steps that I was making on this new planet
Never done it, found all I wanted
The world was so forgiving, open-hearted
Warm and loving, amazing
I never once regretted it
And now brick by brick, I'm rebuilding it
All of the mistakes that I made
Finally led the way to a better place
You might also like
I am with or without you
I am breathing without you
I am somebody without you
I am, I am
I am free without you
I am stronger without you
Thought I would never rise again
But I am, I am

First my remedy, now my poison
Walking out into all my freedom
Oh yeah

I am with or without you
I am stronger without you
Thought I would never rise again
But I am, I am

I am me
Ohhhh1Embed
