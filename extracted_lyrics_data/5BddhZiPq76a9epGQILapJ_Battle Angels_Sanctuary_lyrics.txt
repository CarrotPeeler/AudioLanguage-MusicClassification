5 ContributorsBattle Angels Lyrics
An army of vengeance
Invading from the sky
Hot wings of iron
Pierce into the night
Slaughtering the lost souls
The fruit of evil's womb
Their heathen ways
Have sealed their doom

Echoing across
The distant skies
The shout is heard
Battle angels cry

You'll all fall on your knees
And hail to our dawn
Crawl on your knees
The slaughter is on

The battle is raging
Attack formation set
Hot blood flows through the streets
Their pact is kept
To rape and kill the martyr
Who dwells within this shrine
They did not heed
The warning signs
You might also like
Descending from the clouds
They hunt you still
Battle angels kill
Your force of will

You'll all fall on your knees
And hail to our dawn
Crawl on your knees
The slaughter is on

Slaughter


Fall on your knees
And hail to our dawn
Crawl on your knees
The slaughter is on
Fall on your knees
And hail to our dawn
Crawl on your knees
The slaughter is on
