2 ContributorsFast Life Rider Lyrics
Don't believe a word you say
I can't stand the way you do
Lord, your low-down ways
Comin' home to you
Lord, Fast Life Rider
Steals the life from me
Goin' down

Stayed out last night
All the night before
I done changed that lock
Woman on my door
Lord, Fast Life Rider
Steals the life from me
Goin' down

Done bought me a ticket
The trunk's already gone
Lord, you know by that
I ain't gonna be here long
Lord, Fast Life Rider
Steals the life from me
Goin' downYou might also likeEmbed
