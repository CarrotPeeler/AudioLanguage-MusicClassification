6 Contributors(Notes from the Trial of) La Curandera Lyrics
Did you not grant quarter to the demon
Giving treatment to his wounds?
And would you not consider it unnatural
To be born outside the womb?
We eagerly await your response
And your best defense

La curandera is the young girl
In a linen dress, in a linen dress of white
She dances on black sand in the night
In her linen dress, in her linen dress of white

Let us vote to dunk the witch
In the river Styx and photograph the lye
So, in the shadow of Cerebus
Her spirit will reside

La curandera is the young girl
In a linen dress, in a linen dress of white
She dances on black sand in the night
In her linen dress, in her linen dress of white

Bird in the fire, mouthful of sand
King of the briar, mouthful of sand
The scale and feather, lock and key
Lord of weather, the beast at peace

Shed not a tear for humanity
Go fetch my stars
Shed not a tear for humanity
Go fetch my stars
