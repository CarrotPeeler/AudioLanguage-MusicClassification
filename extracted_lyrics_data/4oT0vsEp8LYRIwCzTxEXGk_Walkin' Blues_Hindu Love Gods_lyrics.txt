2 ContributorsWalkinâ€™ Blues Lyrics
Woke up this mornin'
I was feelin' around for my shoes
I knew I had them
Mean 'ol walkin' blues
But I woke up this mornin'
I was feeling around for my shoes
I know I had them
Mean ol' walkin' blues

Don't ever let her tell you
That the worried blues ain't bad
It's the worst old feeling
That I most ever had
Don't ever let 'em tell you
That the worried blues ain't bad
It's the worst old feeling
I most ever had

Well, I'm leaving Jonesboro
If I have to ride the blind
I've been mistreated
And I don't mind dyin'
Well, I'm leaving Jonesboro
If I have to ride the blind
I've been mistreated
And I don't mind dyin'
Hey!

She's got an Elgin movement
From her head down to her toes
Breakin' on a dollar
Anywhere she goes
She got a Elgin movement
From her head down to her toes
She break in on a dollar
Anywhere she goes

Woke up this mornin'
I was feelin' around for my shoes
I knew I had them
Mean ol' walkin' blues
But I woke up this mornin'
I was feelin' around for my shoes, hey!
I knew I had them
Mean old walkin' blues, yeah
