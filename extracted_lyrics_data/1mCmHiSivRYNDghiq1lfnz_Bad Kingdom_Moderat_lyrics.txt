20 ContributorsBad Kingdom Lyrics
Here it ends
No one’s gonna shed a tear
No need to shout
Just to stand in silence

(A) well spent time
In the early morning’s haze
You sit and wait
Watching full glasses through blank eyes

This is not
What you wanted
Not
What you had in mind
(Oh)
This is not
What you wanted (oh)
Not
What you had in mind

Vacuous winter stare
Worn out version of yourself
Too tough to fall
But not strong enough to turn
But not strong enough to turn
But not strong enough to turn
You might also like
This is not
What you wanted
(Oh)
Not
What you had in mind (oh, oh, oh)
(Oh)
This is not
What you wanted
(Oh)
Not
What you had in mind


(Ah)
This is not
What you wanted
(Ah)
Not
What you had in mind (oh, oh, oh)
(Ah)
This is not
What you wanted
(Ah)
Not
What you had in mind
(Ah)
(Oh)
(Ah)
(Ah, ah, ah)
(Oh)
(Ah)
(Ah, ah, ah)
(Oh)
(Ah)
(Ah, ah, ah)11Embed
