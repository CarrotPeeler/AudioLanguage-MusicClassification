3 ContributorsBlue Ridge Mountains Lyrics
Well, my home is in the Blue Ridge Mountains
My home is in the Blue Ridge Mountains
Well, my home is in the Blue Ridge Mountains
And I ain't coming back here anymore

Well, I had me a mother that could pray, boys
She prayed for me both night and day, boys
And I tore down every prayer that she could say, boys
And I ain't coming back here anymore

I want to find me a lady fair and tender
Want to play her song on my steel strings
Gonna lay her down in a bed of clover
Then I ain't coming back here anymore

Well, I've seen this whole wide country over
From New York City down to Mexico
And I've seen the joyful and the sorrow
And I ain't coming back here anymore

So if Mister Sinbad, can you hear me
Down there in Grayson, Louisiana oh?
Well, I'll lay a joint upon your grave, sir
Then I ain't coming back here anymore
You might also like
Well, my home is in the Blue Ridge Mountains
My home is in the Blue Ridge Mountains
Well, my home is in the Blue Ridge Mountains
And I ain't coming back here anymoreEmbed
