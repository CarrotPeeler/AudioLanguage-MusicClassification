1 ContributorIce Crystal LyricsFace to face, eye to eye
Time for rebirth, time to die
And there will be no way
To reach our goal
Dust to dust, gold to gold
All is gone, all dreams sold
Within my soul until all we had
Has turned to dust
Sometimes I can freeze and endure cold
You are in my body and my soul
Someday I'm petrified and bitterly cold
You are in my heart and shine like gold
Eye to eye, face to face
Say goodbye, just in case
The world will be brand new
Will be newborn
Dust to dust, gold to gold
Every story has been told
And there will be no way
To pay the bill

Sometimes I can freeze and endure cold
You are in my body and my soul
"Ice crystal"
Someday I'm petrified and bitterly cold
You are in my heart and shine like goldEmbed
