5 ContributorsLight My Fire Lyrics
(Ooh, yeah)

You know that it would be untrue
You know that I would be a liar
If I was to say to you, girl
We couldn't get much higher

Come on, baby, light my fire
Come on, baby, light my fire
Try to set the night on fire

Oh, the time to hesitate is through
There's no time to wallow in the mire
If I was to say to you
That our love becomes a funeral pyre

Come on, baby, light my fire
Come on, baby, light my fire
Try to set the night on fire
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh
Mm-mm, yeah
Oh
Light my fire, light my fire, yeah, yeah
Mm-mm, yeah

The time to hesitate is through

Try to set the night on fire, yeah
Come on, baby, light my fire
