And the words that we said, paint her dreams
I could watch her breathing
Far above the clouds where she belongs
There's an hour till sunrise and it feels so strange
There's a note says I'm leaving on morning train
Maybe I could call you high up in the clouds
Where I could fall, I could fall
I could fall for your grace again
I'm lost in this place again
The summer that I loved you
I fell into your arms where I belong
Where I belong
Whеre I belong
Well, it's cold in this city and it's not thе same
And these streets ain't so pretty without you here
So maybe I could call you and hold you in my arms
And I could fall, I could fall
I could fall for your grace again
I'm lost in this place again
The summer that I loved you
I fell into your arms where I belong
Where I belong
You might also likeAnd I can't forget those summer days together
And these city streets are colder now you're gone
Falling
Falling now
I'm gonna fall for you grace
That's where I belong
The summer that I loved you
I fell into your arms where I belong
I could fall for your grace again
I'm lost in this place again
The summer that I loved you
I fell into your arms where I belong
Where I belongEmbed
