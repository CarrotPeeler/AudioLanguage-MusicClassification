Why don't you catch my Shetland and saddle up my black mare
You know ima find my baby, Lord, in the world somewhere
Well he's a Shetland horse and he don't deny his name
He's a Shetland Pony- he don't deny his name
You know the way he can travel is a low-down ol' dirty shame
Looky here horse come on and lets us go
Please pony come on and lets us go
Lets we saddle on down on the Gulf of Mexico
You know he's a travellin horse and he don't deny his name
He's a travellin pony he don't deny his name
The way he can gallop is a low down ol dirty shame
You know I took him by the reins and I led him round and round
Took him by the reins I led him round and round
You know he ain't the best in the world, but hes the best ever been in this town
Why don't you come up here horse, come on and lets us go
I said get up now horse o lord and lets us go
Lets we saddle on down to the Gulf of Mexico
He got four stockin feet and a great long ol curly mane
He got four stockin feet and a great ol curly mane
He got a hot commotion like a high speed ol passenger trainYou might also likeEmbed
