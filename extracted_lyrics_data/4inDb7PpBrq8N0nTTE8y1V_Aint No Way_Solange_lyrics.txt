6 ContributorsAinâ€™t No Way Lyrics
Boy I know that you feeling things
Calling me constantly
Talkin' about you and me
Even so you never told me
That I was the only one
So I did my thang

See me hanging with my girlies
Holla at the fellas maybe
But you can't be mad at me

(So there) ain't no need to trip, no
Cause I ain't ever been your girlfriend
Don't be all up on me
Baby, no way
Gonna do my own thang
Putting that on everything
Don't play me like your girlfriend
Baby, no way

Did you think I would've waited around
That's not I get down
Someone should've told you
Even though you haven't been around
Someone has made me smile
And it feels so good
You might also like
See me hanging with my girlies
Holla at the fellas maybe
But you can't be mad at me

(So there) ain't no need to trip, no
Cause I ain't ever been your girlfriend
Don't be all up on me
Baby, no way
Gonna do my own thang
Putting that on everything
Don't play me like your girlfriend
Baby, no way

Don't you act like you know me
Don't you try to control me
Baby there ain't no way I'm going for that
If you can chill, you can call me
But for now stay up off me
Baby there ain't no way I'm going for that

(So there) ain't no need to trip, no
Cause I ain't ever been your girlfriend
Don't be all up on me
Baby, no way
Gonna do my own thang
Putting that on everything
Don't play me like your girlfriend
Baby, no wayEmbed
