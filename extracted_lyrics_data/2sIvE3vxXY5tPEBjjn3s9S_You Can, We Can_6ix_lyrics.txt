2 ContributorsADAM Lyrics
Adam this is for you
This for all the past times in 2017
The rough times
This song is dedicated to you because I love you and you're my uso

It was 2017 when I met you
I didn’t wanna hang out but I let you
All these niggas now they love you to
Yea we brothers, I don’t need no auto tune
Your my baby when I pull up up you pull up to aye
Yea I know this song sound really gay
But I don’t have no other way
To express myself yea I gotta  ask you
Can we  drink kool aid til Sunday
Be like super 6ix9ine let ya nuts hang
Scum gang
Hit it up, talk tough, we will bluff
Aussie slang
Samoan gang
Asian slang
Gang gang
I sang, you hang, wit me
Yea hit it up, talk tough, we will bluff
You might also likeYou don’t know what you mean to me
You gotta stop being mean to me
Yea I know you got your places to be
But you still can love me1Embed
