6 ContributorsPacing Deathâ€™s Trail Lyrics
Compassion, confession
It's all a compromise
Dedication, domination
Please define the lines

Irritation, innovation
Paired-up to succeed
Retaliation, termination
Fake smiles and greed

Surrender to nothing
Or run as far as you can

I'm trying to hold on
To what I believe in
But my heart, is in a coma

Aggression, attention
A need to be seen
Directed, disrespected
Stand in line to be thankful, obscene
You might also like
Surrender to nothing
Or run as far as you can

I'm trying to hold on
To what I believe in
But my heart, is in a coma


Surrender to nothing
Or run as far as you can

I'm trying to hold on
To what I believe in
But my heart, is in a coma
I'm trying to hold on
To what I believe in
But my heart, is in a comaEmbed
