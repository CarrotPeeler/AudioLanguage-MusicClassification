6 ContributorsStarcrazy Lyrics
She's star, starcrazy
Electric-shock-bog-brush-hair
Flat on her back in the '80s
In the '90s going nowhere

Star, starcrazy
Got a kicking transistor inside
A heavy metal stutter that brains me
And an electric love in her eyes

Oh, she don't want education
She got nothing to say
She got no imagination, so they say
Why does she feel this way?
Why does she feel this way?

Cos she's star, starcrazy
Getting stupid on the streets tonight
And shaking like a mechanical thing
With an electric love in her eyes

Oh, she don't want education
She got nothing to say
She got no imagination, so they say
Why does she feel this way?
Why does she feel this way?

She don't want education
She got nothing to say
She got no imagination, so they say
Why does she feel this way?

Oh, she don't want education
She got nothing to say
She got no imagination, so they say
Why does she feel this way?

Oh, she don't want education
She got nothing to say
She got no imagination, so they say
Why does she feel this way?
Why does she feel this way?
Why does she feel this way?1Embed
