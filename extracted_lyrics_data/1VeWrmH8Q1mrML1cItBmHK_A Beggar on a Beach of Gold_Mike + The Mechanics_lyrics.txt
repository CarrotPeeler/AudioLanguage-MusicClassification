4 ContributorsA Beggar on a Beach of Gold LyricsI didn't know when I was lucky, discontented feeling bad
Filled with envy for possessions other people had
I found my pride had always hurt me, fought the world to gain control
Not realizing I was sitting on a beach of gold
Oh lord, I'm a poor man with all the riches I can hold
I'm a beggar, and I'm sitting on a beach of gold
The problems I encountered gave me strength, helped me sustain
To know the pleasure first I had to cure the pain
When I was searching for solutions, I found the answer lay in me
I'm a drifter, but I'm drifting on a silver sea
Oh lord, I'm a poor man with all the riches I can hold
I'm a beggar, and I'm sitting on a beach of gold
I didn't have courage, my life was as dark as night
When alone in the darkness, I saw the brightest light
Let the light shine down
Are you out there now on empty, feel you've nothing left to give
Sick of trying have you lost the will to live?
Don't be drowning in the shallows with the beach so near at hand
Hear the voice say stand up, get up and join me on the gilded sand
Come and join me on the beach with all the riches I can hold
Cause I'm a beggar, and I'm sitting on a beach of gold
Oh lord, I'm a poor man with all the riches I can hold
I'm a beggar, I'm sitting on a beach of gold

They're my teachers playing on the golden sand
With my family all around me, I've all the riches I can hold
I'm a beggar sitting on a beach of gold
Oh lord, I'm a poor man with all the riches I can hold
I'm a beggarEmbed
