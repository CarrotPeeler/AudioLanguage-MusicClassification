1 ContributorSkeletons LyricsRumours going round in circles
That youve been seeing some else
You know I love surprises
But baby not that kind
Whenever theres smoke theres fire
You know im not a jealous guy but
I need to know there lying
I need to hear you say that
Theres nothing going on
Let them dance
Break the news
Let the skeletons in your closet dance
You gotta choose
Let them loose
Im waiting
So let me know whats going down
Have I been wasting my love?
Is it a last goodbye love?
Come look into my eyes
I promise
I'll be thinking twice I promise (yeah)
Cause you're my everything
My heart is in your hands
My heart is in your handsYou might also likeEmbed
