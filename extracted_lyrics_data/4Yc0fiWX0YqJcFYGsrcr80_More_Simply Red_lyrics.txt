We used to meet
From time to time
Up in the mountain

You've had your flings
I've had mine
You've grown your wings
I've flown mine

The only way out is to
Give you more love
More of my love
More and more and more and more
Of my love

Not a girl of my dreams
But two hearts and two minds
The strain that brings
Is ours until the end of time

The only way out was to
Give you more love
(I'm gonna give you my love)
More of my love (More of my love)
Give you more love
(Please take all of my love)
More of my love
More and more and more and more
Of my love

The only way out was to
Give you more love
(I'm gonna give you my love)
More of my love (More of my love)
Give you more love
(Please take all of my love)
More of my love (More of my love)
Give you more love
I gonna give you
More of my love
More and more and more and more
Of my love

Give you more love, please, please
More of my love (More of my love)
Give you more love (I wanna take it )
More of my love
More and more and more and more
Of my loveEmbed
