15 ContributorsGroundhogâ€™s Day Lyrics
When I woke up this morning I felt a pang
I was hungering for some apple pie
Stumble in the bathroom, hung my hog a little bit
Washed the sleep out of my eye

Oh yeah, it's gonna be a fine day

Scratched myself a bit, poured me out a bowl of Corn Chex
Closest thing I could find to apple pie
Lingering taste of toothpaste made the milk go down a bit funny
But you know, them Chex they do satisfy

Oh yeah, this'll be a fine day

So, after my morning rise-n-shine and eat-n-clean
Had my mind set to hit them streets
Drizzle from the night left cold puddles out
Had my black stomp-boots on my feet

It's my day
It's my day, my day

Since I was in kneepants my pop had tried to make me realize
If I set my mind down to it I could be a big man in the public eye
So with my big blue collar on, I set out to find the easy way
What an ice cold bath it was when I found you had to pay to play
To taste the taste, it's a tease that never would subside
The taste is strong but soured by my learned eyes
Well, if a woodchuck could chuck wood he'd get down on his knees to pray
This little snappy boy might see the light this ground hog's dayEmbed
