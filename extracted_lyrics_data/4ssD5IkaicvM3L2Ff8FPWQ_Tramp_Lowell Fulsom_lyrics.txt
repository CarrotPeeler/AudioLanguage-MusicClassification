Tramp
You can call me that
I don't wear continental clothes
Stetson hats

But I'm a lover, haha
Mama was
Papa too
I'm the oldest child
Lovin' is all I know to do

Huh, call me country
Right from the woods
I'll answer when you call me
Uh, baby, I mean that if it, uh, makes you feel good

But I'm just a lover
Mama was
Papa too
But I'm the oldest child
Lovin' is all I know to do
You might also like

Now whatever you call me, ha
I'll even go for that
'Cause I keep a fat bankroll in my pocket, baby, haha
You know I own three Cadillacs

'Cause I'm just a lover, haha
Mama was
Papa too
I'm the oldest child
Lovin' is all I know to doEmbed
