2 ContributorsBodies In Motion LyricsWhoa
Whoa
Whoa

I spread my wings, I tried to fly
I believed in myself when there was nothing right
Now I, know I am dust, I know we are sand
But we give of ourselves as best as we can
Why does it always rain on Mondays
For me?

Bodies in motion
Bodies at rest
Got to get inside you
Got to get lost
Jump into the water
Jump into your life
Diving in deep
To your ever changing light

I been lost and I been found
I made my bed in this sea of sound
And we have been so high, been so low
Are you the one that I need to know
You might also likeWhy does it always rain on Mondays
For me

Bodies in motion
Bodies at rest
Got to get inside you
Got to get lost
Jump into the water
Jump into your life
Diving in deep
To your ever changing light
Into the deep of your ever changing light
Of your ever changing, never changing light

Into your light
Into your light
We found love and we found pain
And I know that you're sinking 'cause I feel the same
Why does it always rain on Mondays
For me
Bodies in motion
Bodies at rest
Got to get inside you
Got to get lost
Jump into the water
Jump into your life
Diving in deep
To your ever changing light
Bodies in motion
Bodies at rest
Got to get inside you
Got to get lost
Jump into the water
Jump into your life
Diving in deep
To your ever changing light
Whoa
