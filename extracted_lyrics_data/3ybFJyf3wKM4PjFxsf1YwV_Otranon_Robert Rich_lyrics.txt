3 ContributorsGothic Novels LyricsGothic literature began in the later eighteenth century. Its origin is attributed to English author Horace Walpole's 1764 novel The Castle of Otranto. The novel was immensely popular and had many imitators. It set out many of the conventions of what was to become the 'Gothic novel'.
Notable works of Gothic literature:
The great volume of Gothic novels produced from the 1770s to 1820 is too great to list here. The short sample of the rediscovered Northanger Abbey 'horrid novels' is an example of some of the many that were probably justifiably forgotten.

Style and Atmosphere:
- Aspects of self-parody or camp.
- Dreams.
- Rich imagery and language.
- Mystery and dread.
- Power and constraint. It's not a gothic novel if the heroine is not locked up or constrained in some way. They are also usually pursued and/or forced into marriage.
- Terror and horror.
- The Supernatural.
- Transgression. There is not a crime that a Gothic villain has not commited in some gothic novel or another.
Characters:

- Villain-Hero. In different forms: the Satanic Hero, the Promethean Hero, and the Byronic Hero.
- The Outsider.
Setting:
- Distant time period, especially a medieval setting.
- Foreign setting, especially Spain and Italy. Germany and France are also big favourites.

- The Sublime. This includes landscape and as well as weather.
Narration:
- Unreliable narrators.
- Nested narration.
