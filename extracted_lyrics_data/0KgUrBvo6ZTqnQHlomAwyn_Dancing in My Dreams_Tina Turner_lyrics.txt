7 ContributorsDancing in My Dreams Lyrics
I've been running from the truth
I've been running since my youth
Tired of running
I will stand here 'til you see
I am you and you are me
Tired of running

There really is no difference
When you look beneath the skin
Someday I know, we'll go beyond
This world we're living in

Now when I lay me down to sleep
I will be dancing in my dreams
Seeing the way it all should be
I will be dancing
Now when I lay me down to sleep
I will be dancing in my dreams
Seeing the way it all should be
I will be dancing, ooh, dancing in my dreams

There's no hiding in the dark
From the beating of my heart, it's getting louder
Just as long as we believe
The truth will set us free, it's getting louder
All that really matters, is the light in your face
In you, I see the longing of the whole human race
You might also like
Now when I lay me down to sleep
I will be dancing in my dreams
Seeing the way it all should be
I will be dancing
Now when I lay me down to sleep
I will be dancing in my dreams
Seeing the way it all should be
I will be dancing, dancing in my dreams

All along the story goes
Or it's the passing of the torch, ooh
With one small pass, it all begins
Then there are millions more, millions more


Now when I lay me down to sleep
I will be dancing in my dreams
Seeing the way it all should be
I will be dancing
Now when I lay me down to sleep
I will be dancing in my dreams
Seeing the way it all should be
I will be dancing, oh-oh, dancing in my dreams
Oh, oh, no, no, oh
Dancing in my dreamsEmbed
