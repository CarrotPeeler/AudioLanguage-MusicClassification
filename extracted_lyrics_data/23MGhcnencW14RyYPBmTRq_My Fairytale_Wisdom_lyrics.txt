1 ContributorMy Fairytale Lyrics"My dreams were all my own; accounted for them to nobody, they were my refuge when annoyed - my dearest pleasure when free."
â€“ Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley

Once upon a time I was
Laying under the stars and closed
Both my eyes and dreamed away
Dreamed of a place where the fairies play

I hope it never ends, this is what I like to do
Sometimes I know, the wildest dreams come true

My fairytale is a new reality
This is my fairytale
Not a fable or just fantasy

Livin' in a magic world
Every day is a miracle
Take my hands and come with me
Don't be afraid to be young and free

Sometimes I know, the wildest dreams come true

My fairytale is a new reality
This is my fairytale
Not a fable or just fantasy


I hope it never ends, this is what I like to do
Sometimes I know, the wildest dreams come true

My fairytale is a new reality
This is my fairytale
Not a fable or just fantasy

Come together and dream with me
Breathe the air I breathe
Come together and dream with me
Dreams will set you freeEmbed
