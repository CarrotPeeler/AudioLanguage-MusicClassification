1 ContributorHide Myself LyricsWhat if I die
Would you even cry
God knows it's true
I didn't understand you
I've been trying to hide myself from you
I've been trying to run and hide from you
Got no reason to go
Got no reason to stay
Got no reason to go
Got no reason to stay
God knows it's true
God knows it's over
God knows it's true
God knows it's over
God knows it's true
God knows it's over
Got news for you
You didn't understand meYou might also likeEmbed
