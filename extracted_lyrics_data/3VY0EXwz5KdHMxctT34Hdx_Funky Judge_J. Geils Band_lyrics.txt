Thank you, thank you
I want no shenanigans in my courtroom
Please bring on the first case
I didn't do it
Got my lawyer
Hey, officer
Get these here cuffs off of me
Hey, Judge
Aw, let me talk to you, Judge
Hey, Judge, Judge
Judge, you sure is funky
Judge, you sure is funky
Judge, you sure is funky (Listen to me)
Judge, you sure is funky
Listen
I didn't do it, Your Honor
What they told you was a lie
Judge, you sure is funky (Got to tell you, baby)
Judge, you sure is funky
Judge, Judge, Judge, Judge
Judge, you sure is funky (Good God almighty)

I didn't do it, Your Honor
What they told you was a lie
Just call my mother, please
She'll give you my alibi
I didn't do it, Your Honor
They told you a lie
Now you're gonna send me away
And I wanna know why, woo
Yeah
I didn't do it, Your Honor
I'm a really nice guy, wow
Judge, you sure is funky (Aw yeah)
Judge, you sure is funky (I saw you, Funky Judge)
Judge, Judge, Judge, Judge
Where do you come from, young man?
I come from The Bronx, Your Honor
Hmm, is that so?
I sentence you to 14 years
What?
Hey, Judge, I've been framed, I've been framed
I gotta call my lawyer
Let me call the lawyer
I just want his love and affection
I won't be put in no house of corruption
Come on, Judge, I'll get the records real true
Come on, baby
Hey, Judge, come on, Judge
Hey, JudgeEmbed
