(But all I want to know is where the party at)
(But all I want to know is where the party at)
Let's have a party, let's have a party
(But all I want to know is where the party at)
Everybody, let's have a party
(But all I want to know is where the party at)

I've been watching you
You've been watching me
Let's stop playing games, girl
Come and dance with me
Don't you hear the music
Don't you feel the groove, yeah
Come on, girl, get on the floor
I want to dance with you
(But all I want to know is where the party at)

Let's have a party
Everybody, throw your hands up in the air
Let's have a party
I like the way you swing, yeah
(But all I want to know is where the party at)
Everybody, girl, you know, you are looking good
Let's have a party
Girl, you got to work that body
(But all I want to know is where the party at)
You might also like
Girl, I must be dreaming
To have a night like this
Holding hands, being close
Sharing our first kiss
You really blow my mind
I can't believe it's true
I've been waiting all night long
To get a girl like you
(But all I want to know is where the party at)

Let's have a party
We're moving to the groove, yeah
Let's have a party
All the fellas and the honeys
(But all I want to know is where the party at)
Everybody, cause we're gonna have a party
Let's have a party
So everybody, enjoy yourself with me
(But all I want to know is where the party at)

Welcome, everybody to the party
Don't forget the honeys
The mad fun has just begun at the party, yo
Give a call or beep and make sure your girl ain't creeping
It's time to get it on the dance floor
You want more than what you came here for
I see you looking at me across the dance floor
I wish for that sweet little kiss
Don't be no Cinderella and go poof after midnight
Uh, yeah
(But all I want to know is where the party at)
(But all I want to know is where the party at)
(But all I want to know is where the party at)
(But all I want to know is where the party at)
(But all I want to know is where the party at)

Let's have a party, I like, mmm, everybody
Let's have a party
Throw your hands up in the air, everybody, everybody
(But all I want to know is where the party at)
Everybody, girl, you know, you are looking good
Let's have a party, I like the way, yeah
(But all I want to know is where the party at)
Let's have a party
Take it, baby, we're moving through the groove
Let's have a party
Everybody, throw your hands up
(But all I want to know is where the party at)
Let's have a party
Take it, 'cause we're gonna have a party
Let's have a party
So everybody enjoy yourself with me
(But all I want to know is where the party at)
Let's have a party
So everybody enjoy yourself with you
Let's have a party
So everybody enjoy yourself with you
(But all I want to know is where the party at)
EverybodyEmbed
