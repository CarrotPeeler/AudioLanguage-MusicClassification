3 ContributorsDay of Mourning Lyrics
A startling phone call led
To a night of little sleep
Counting blessings instead of sheep
We gathered the next morning

Renewing a bond weakened
By years of separation
And though our worlds had slowly drifted apart

The early memories we shared still remained
Timeless in our hearts, there was a time when
We closely followed each others footsteps
Dreaming of endless summers and becoming drummers

Those days are gone
We mourn the loss of a childhood friend
Trapped in a man's fading intellect

So long
Let these tears wash away the blood on your hands
So long
You're forgiven for easing her pain
You might also like
I can still picture the
Apartment where it took place
We used to play for hours downstairs
Beating drums and hitting snares

Embrace those times to endure
That day felt like your funeral
Until we meet again
You will never be forgottenEmbed
