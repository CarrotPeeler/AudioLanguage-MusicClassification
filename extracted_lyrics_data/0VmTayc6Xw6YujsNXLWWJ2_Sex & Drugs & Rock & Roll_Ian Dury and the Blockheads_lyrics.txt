6 ContributorsSex and Drugs and Rock and Roll LyricsSex and drugs and rock and roll
Is all my brain and body need
Sex and drugs and rock and roll
Is very good indeed
Keep your silly ways, or throw them out the window
The wisdom of your ways, I've been there and I know
Lots of other ways, what a jolly bad show
If all you ever do is business you don't like
Sex and drugs and rock and roll
Sex and drugs and rock and roll
Sex and drugs and rock and roll
Is very good indeed
Every bit of clothing ought to make you pretty
You can cut the clothing, grey is such a pity
I should wear the clothing of Mr. Walter Mitty
See my tailor, he's called Simon, I know it's going to fit
Here's a little bit of advice
You're quite welcome it is free:
Don't do nothing that is cut price
You know what that'll make you be
They will try their tricky device
Trap you with the ordinary
Get your teeth into a small slice
The cake of liberty

Sex and drugs and rock and roll (Ow, ow)
Sex and drugs and rock and roll (Ow, ow, ow, ow)
Sex and drugs and rock and roll (Wuh, ah, ah, ah)
Sex and drugs and rock and roll (Ah)
Sex and drugs and rock and roll
Sex and drugs and rock and roll

Sex and drugs and rock and roll, sex, and drugs
