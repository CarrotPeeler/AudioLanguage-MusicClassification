1 ContributorFunding Fun LyricsGotta have fun to get funds
Gotta have funds to get fun
Gotta have funds to get fun
Gotta have fun to get funds
Paradoxical treatment
For these words I'm fiendin'
The palm psalms I'm readin'
Blurry mind I'm leanin'
But never fallin I'm callin out
No call back but I have no doubt
Parsing parchment regular route
No tag backs scream and shout
Dance, study, make money to this
Scream out, be funny, call a honey to this
Let's take a shot - yo, what is a miss?
It's sunny, be happy, jot up a list
For the day, bullet point, and cross it all out
It ain't that hard to if you sing it without a doubt
Top Notes singing Twist and Shout
Beatles covered that, did you know that route?
Mad hatter
Chitter chattеr
Matterhorn train
All these convеrsations
Swirling in my brain
Hold up
Pause the phone
Let me explain
Feign the fire
Tame the impala
Stop this pain
Or keep it going
So i better understand
What's random
What is planned
Mmmbop like hanson
Quick like that then I ran
One hit wonder
Tom seleck mustache sized
Blunder
One in the same
Hand in hand
Ain't walking it's lame
No star of fame
Asteroid of shame
Indebted to a dastardly dame
Phone rings
Who that I'm not wiser
Chili's hot reminder
Come in before thursday
Free appetizer
You might also likeDoze off on the couch
Reruns of the news
Before the slumber
Remember to hit snooze
What it do
What it was
What you want
What it all about
Rut of rust
Do the doubt
Out the outlandish
Aim at the amount

Frozen off and closed down ima grouch
Just a slouch with a loud ass mouth
And im crouched in the corner
Electrics run from pinky to my brain like Warner
Brothers tryna take over the world
Call the coroner, and im a foreigner
In my own mind, someone shoulda warned ya
Someone shoulda showed you the door man

The same thing we do ever night, Pinky
Good vibes only drinking Fiji in Helsinki
Hakuna My tatas til I'm blue like Rafiki
People praying - yet they still will never be me
Only one, solo uno, Yuiitsu
Hell, sun flew over the pinned down horseshoe
Not even alchemists can make this kind of home brew
Heavens to betsy all they whip through is a miscueEmbed
