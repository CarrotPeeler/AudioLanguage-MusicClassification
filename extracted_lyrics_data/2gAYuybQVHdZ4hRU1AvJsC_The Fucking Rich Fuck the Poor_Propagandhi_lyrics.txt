5 ContributorsThe Fucking Rich Fuck the Poor LyricsHouse here, house there
House fucking every where
Bloodied bum on the street, just stop and fucking stare
Rich support the Apartheid farce
People are starving, the aid is sparse
It's just the fucking rich fucking the poor
Bribing their way through heaven's door
Justice's all we're asking for
Still, the fucking rich fuck the poor
Businesses and government suck each other prick
Financial wealth don't stop you from being thick
Jump at the chance to make military parts
Destroy all close to your heart
It's just the fucking rich fucking the poor
Bribing their way through heaven's door
Justice's all we're asking for
Still, the fucking rich fuck the poorYou might also likeEmbed
