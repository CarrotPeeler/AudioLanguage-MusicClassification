1 ContributorWild Bill Jones LyricsI was out a-walking around one night
And I met with old Wild Bill Jones
He was walking, he was talking with the girl I love
And I bid him for to leave her alone
He said, "Young man, I am twenty-two
Too old for to be controlled"
I drew a revolver from my side
And I destroyed one poor boy’s soul
He rambled and he scrambled all on the ground
And he gave one deathly moan
He looked in the face of his darling true love
Says, "Oh, darling you are left alone"
My money's in my pockets and my pistol's in my hand
Looking for thе man that made old Wild Bill standYou might also likeEmbed
