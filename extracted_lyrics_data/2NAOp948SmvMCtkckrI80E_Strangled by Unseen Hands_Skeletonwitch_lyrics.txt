3 ContributorsStrangled by Unseen Hands LyricsSlowly stalking, flawless killer, ender of all life
Constant phantom, lurking, prowling
Hunting man and beast alike
Undefeated, the ravages of time
All consuming, to the years all things must die
No gods in heaven, nor the evils cast down below
Can halt the path to our destiny
It's come to take us all
Strangled by the unseen hands of time
Flesh and bone to dust
Strangled by the unseen hands of time
Returning all to the dirt
We are all doomed
Cannot escape these years
Returning all to the dirt
Dirt
Dark in death's shadow, predator of souls
Hunter of the living, time destroys us allYou might also likeEmbed
