10 ContributorsMovinâ€™ Out Lyrics
We all live on the edge of town
Where we all live, ain't a soul around
People start comin', all we do is just a-grin
Said, "We've got to move out 'cause the city's moving in"
I said, "We've got to move out 'cause the city's moving in"

Tell me who you know and I'll tell you who, too
Go see my friend and he'll set you free
Tell me what you need, and maybe I can go too
No one knows the way but maybe me

Nobody knows where, nobody shows where
Nobody knows where you can find me, yeah

Good morning, glory, Hallelujah to you
What is the story? What's been going through you?
Living like a king off the fat of the land
Working like a dog in a rock and roll band

We're moving, we're getting out
We're moving, without a doubt
We're moving, we're going far
We're moving, oh, yes, we are
You might also like
'Cause nobody goes there, nobody shows where
Nobody knows where you can find me
Nobody knows there, nobody shows where
Nobody goes where you can find me, ah
Oh, Lordy, Lordy, Lordy



Level with God and you're in tune with the universe
Talk with yourself and you'll hear what you want to know
Got to rise above 'cause below it's only getting worse
Life, in time, will take you where you want to go

Where you want to go, where you want to go
Where are you going? Where are you going? Where are you going?
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah-ah, oh-oh


Good morning, glory, Hallelujah to you
What is the story? What's been going through you?
Living like a king off the fat of the land
Working like a dog in a rock and roll band
We're moving, we're getting out
We're moving, without a doubt
We're moving, we're going far
We're moving, oh, yes, we are

'Cause nobody knows where, nobody shows there
Nobody goes where you can find me
Nobody knows where, nobody shows there
Nobody goes where you can find me

We all live on the edge of town
Where we all live, ain't a soul around
People start comin', all we do is just a-grin
Said, "We've got to move out 'cause the city's moving in"
I said, "We've got to move out 'cause the city's moving in," yeah1Embed
