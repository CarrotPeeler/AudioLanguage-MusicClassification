I always find out too late
You wouldn't believe what I'm on
In all this time, I've found nothing to live without it for
Help me only
Help me only
Help me get me on my feet
I feel like turning me down
I feel like turning me down
Good to see ya, Anne Maria
Good to see ya, Anne Maria
I never was anything
Can't be happy or unhappy
You wouldn't believe what I'm on
In all this time, I've found nothing to live without it for
Help me only
Help me only
Help me get me on my feet
I feel like turning me down
I feel like turning me down
Good to see ya, Anne Maria
Good to see ya, Anne Maria

Oh, what are you now?
What's wrong with you, little flame?
What's wrong with you, little flame?
I've been trying to cool off for so long
In all this time, I've found nothing to stop real pain
Help me only
Help me only
Help me get me on my feet
I feel like turning me down
I feel like turning me down
Good to see ya, Anne Maria
Good to see ya, Anne MariaEmbed
