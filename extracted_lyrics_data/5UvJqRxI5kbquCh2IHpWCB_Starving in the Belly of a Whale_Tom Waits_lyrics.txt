11 ContributorsStarving in the Belly of a Whale Lyrics
Life is whittled, life's a riddle
Man's a fiddle that life plays on
When the day breaks and the earth quakes
Life's a mistake all day long

You tell me who gives a good goddamn
You'll never get out alive
Don't go dreaming
Don't go scheming
A man must test his mettle
In the crooked old world

Starving in the belly, starving in the belly
Starving in the belly of a whale
Oh, you're starving in the belly, starving in the belly
Starving in the belly of a whale

Don't take my word, just look skyward
They that dance must pay the fiddler
Sky is darkening, dogs are barking
But the caravan moves on
You might also like
You tell me who gives a good goddamn
You'll never get get out alive
Don't go dreaming
Don't go scheming
A man must test his mettle
In the crooked old world

Starving in the belly, starving in the belly
Starving in the belly of a whale
Oh, we're starving in the belly, starving in the belly
Starving in the belly of a whale, ha

As the crow flies, it's there the truth lies
At the bottom of the well
E-O-eleven goes to Heaven
Bless the dead here as the rain falls
Don't trust a bull's horn, a Doberman's tooth
A runaway horse or me
Don't be greedy
Don't be needy
If you live in hope, you're dancing
To a terrible tune
Starving in the belly, starving in the belly
Starving in the belly of a whale
Oh, starving in the belly, starving in the belly
Starving in the belly of a whaleEmbed
