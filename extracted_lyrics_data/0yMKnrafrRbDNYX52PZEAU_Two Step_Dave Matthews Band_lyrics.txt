13 ContributorsTwo Step Lyrics
Say, my love, I came to you with best intention
You laid down to give to me just what I'm seeking
Say love, you drive me to distraction

Oh my love do you believe that we might last
A thousand years, or more if not for this
Our flesh and blood, it ties you and me right up
Tie me down, ah well

Celebrate we will
Because life is short but sweet for certain
(Hey)
We climb on two by two
To be sure these days continue
Things we cannot change
(Change)
(Why would I want to change it)
(Change)

Hey, my love, you came to me like
Wine comes to this mouth
Grown tired of water all the time
You quench my heart and, oh, you
Quench my mind and say
You might also like
Celebrate we will
'Cause life is short but sweet for certain
(Hey)
We climb on two by two
To be sure these days continue
Things we cannot

Celebrate (Celebrate we will)
Oh, you and me girl
(Climb on two by)
Climb on two by
(Climb on two by)
Two, to be sure
These days continue
Things we cannot change
Change
Change

Oh, my love I came to you
With best intention
You laid down to give to me
Just what I'm seeking
Say love, watch me celebrate together
Celebrate we will
Cause life is short
But sweet for certain
(Hey)
We climb on two by two
To be sure these days continue
Things we cannot change
(Celebrate together)
Oh ho
(Climb on two by two)
(Climb on two by two)
(Celebrate these days come two)
Things we cannot change

I took it all, I took it all
