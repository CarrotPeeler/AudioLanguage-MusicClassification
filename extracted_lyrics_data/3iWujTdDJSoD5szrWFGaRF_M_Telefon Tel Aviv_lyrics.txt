What you want
So did I
You're no good
But I'm not either

All I can see
All I can see
All I can see
All I can s-
All I can see
All I can see
All I can see
All I can s-
All I can see
All I can see
All I can see
All I can s-
All I can see
All I can see
All I can see
All I can see

I've done bad things
I've done bad things
I'm no good
That makes the two of us (two of us)

All I can see
All I can see
All I can see
All I can s-
All I can see
All I can see
All I can see
All I can s-
All I can see
All I can see
All I can see
All I can s-
All I can see
All I can see
All I can see
All I can see

Hate hates the hater
A curious state
What does that mean for me
Do I hate my fate

All I can see
All I can see
All I can see
All I can s-
All I can see
All I can see
All I can see
All I can s-
All I can see
All I can see
All I can see
All I can s-
All I can see
All I can see
All I can see
All I can see
All I can see
All I can see
All I can see
All I can s-
All I can see
All I can see
All I can see
All I can s-
All I can see
All I can see
All I can see
All I can s-
All I can see
All I can see
All I can see
All I can seeEmbed
