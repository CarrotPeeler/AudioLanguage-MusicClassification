1 ContributorSorry Lyrics
Girl, we need to talk
'Cause I can't look at you
And keep this to myself
'Cause every time I see her eyes
The thought comes back to mind
Girl, I didn't want to do it
But I gave into temptation
I couldn't hold it back
She really put me on
And I swear I never meant to hurt you
But it's killin' me
'Cause now I'm so afraid

'Cause I don't want to lose you
Girl, I'm sorry, forgive me
If you just let me explain
Girl, I'm sorry, forgive me

Baby, now I understand
If you just want to up and leave
After what I've done 'cause I don't deserve you
But if you can only take the time
And think of what we had
If you could just give me a second chance
'Cause baby we could live romance
Baby, just me and you
No one in between us
Now I know I'm asking for too much
But if you still have a heart
Girl, that's all I need
You might also like
'Cause I don't want to lose you
Girl, I'm sorry, forgive me
If you just let me explain
Girl, I'm sorry, forgive me

I don't want you to leave
Because I love you
Girl, I can't see myself
Livin' without you
I don't know what I'd do if I lose you

'Cause I don't want to lose you
Girl, I'm sorry, forgive me
If you just let me explain
Girl, I'm sorry, forgive me
No I don't want to lose you
Girl, I'm sorry, forgive me
If you just let me explain
Girl, I'm sorry, forgive me

I'm sorry, babe
I'm sorry, babe
Sorry, babe
Sorry, babe
I'm sorry, babe
Sorry, babe
Sorry, babe
Sorry
Oh, oh-woahEmbed
