2 ContributorsWiseblood LyricsWhen I was young
Some wise fool told me
Live and learn
But nothing comes for free
So I did what I could
When I was able
To keep the truth
Away from my table
Young blood creepin'
What you need?
Wiseblood shake him down
To his knees guaranteed
Well I never walked
I just learned to fly
And your heaven or high
Was the way I stayed alive
I've seen them devils
Pound our bible
You saints and sinners
Are both my rival
Young blood creepin'
What you need?
Wiseblood shake him down
To his knees
Aim to please
You might also like-Solos-
Well there's blood on the street
But there's nothin to steal from me
Cause I walk alone
But at least I walk for free
I listen to few and I'm fueled by fire
Guess now I'm old and not much wiser
Young blood creepin'
What you need?
Wiseblood shake him down
To his knees
Young blood creepin'
What you need?
Wiseblood shake him down
To his knees guaranteedEmbed
