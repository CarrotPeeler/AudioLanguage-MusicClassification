9 ContributorsSomething Special Lyrics
Yeah, yeah yeah
Yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah
This one's for the lovers
Follow me

Clearly, this is new for me
I get excited when you're here, my dear
Make no mistake, you are all I see, sugar
My visions never been so clear, hah
We both know that I've been running so long
This time, love won't let me leave
Please be patient, hesitation aside
We're almost where we need to be
But in the meantime, let me say what's on my mind

Baby I, I think we've got something special
Girl, you and me together, we'll take over the world
You know I love you, I need your soul
So happy, I just wanna let everybody know

Think back to the time
When I was scared to let it show
Having too much fun, this and that or what
Now that you're mine
Ha, yeah, somewhere along the way, everything fell in place

I'm so proud of how you represent me, baby
Whether rocking Armani, Dolce Gabbana
Roberto Cavalli, Louie, or Gucci, girl
No matter what you wear, you do your own with it
I'll feel the same years from here
But in the meantime, let me say what's on my mind
Ooh, listen

I think we've got something special
Girl, you and me together, we'll take over the world
You know I love you, I need your soul
So happy, I just wanna let everybody know
That I think we've got something special
Girl, you and me together, we'll take over the world
You know I love you, I need your soul
So happy, I just wanna let everybody know

You know I need you baby, you know I do
I need you baby, you know I do
I need you baby, you know I do
Know I need you baby
Now that you're mine
Somewhere along the way, everything fell in place
Baby, I think we've got something special
Girl, you and me together, we'll take over the world
You know I love you, I need your soul
So happy, I just wanna let everybody know
I think we've got something special
Girl, you and me together, we'll take over the world
You know I love you, girl, I need your soul
I'll never, never let you go, no

You're so specialEmbed
