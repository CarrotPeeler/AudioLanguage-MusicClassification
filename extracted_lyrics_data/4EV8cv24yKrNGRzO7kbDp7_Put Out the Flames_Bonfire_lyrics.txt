Campfire no bonfire gone wild from the desire
Can retire for what though got a lot but nothing much though
But he still wanting that much more
Cause to him it's not enough no
Been so invested in dough when the
Bread ahead just get mold
And it goes to show must go on when he's told to see the door on go on
So gone when it's him or us
Looking like its icarus
Wax wings and all and then embers start to fall
Looking homeward this is LA give the department a call
Its coming down

Ash covering the land he's looking at his hands
No blood or death but his mental
Method acting lady of Macbeth. Feeling harsh of breath
Partial deaf from explosion. no sudden motion
Let it set in feeling so low but this ain't no Frank Ocean
Better down the potion
He hates drinking alone. Too late to atone all that he shown;
Selfish so why would they pick up the phone
He posting up they just leave him alone
To each be his own he's chosen;
Devotion to promotion
To put out the flames he jumped
They found him washed up out the oceanEmbed
