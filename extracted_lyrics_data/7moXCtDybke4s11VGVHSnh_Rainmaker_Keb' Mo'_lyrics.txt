It's always calm just before the storm, you know
Along she came, with a brand new season
Since we've been together
There's been a change in the weather
She's a rainmaker
She makes the rain fall from my eyes
She's a rainmaker
She makes a grown man wanna cry
Well, I never thought
That a tear could fall
From the eyes of a man
Who never even cried at all
Now, I've been happy
I've been blue
For the change in the seaso&110
She's a rainmaker
She makes the rain fall from my eyes
She's a rainmaker
She makes a grown man wanna cry
The lightning flashes, the thunder roars
There's no stoppin' the wind
The tide is washing
Her a path to my door
I've never ever loved like this before

There's a rainbow in my life
Clouds are gone, the sky is clear
And since we've been together
There's been a change in the weather
She's a rainmaker
She makes the rain fall from my eyes
She's a rainmaker
She makes a grown man wanna cry
She's a rainmaker
She makes the rain fall from my eyes
She's a rainmaker
She makes a grown man wanna cryEmbed
