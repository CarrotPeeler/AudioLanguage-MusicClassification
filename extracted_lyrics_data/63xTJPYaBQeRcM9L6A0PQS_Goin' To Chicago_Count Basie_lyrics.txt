Going to Chicago, sorry that I can't take you
Going to Chicago, sorry that I can't take you
There's nothing in Chicago that a monkey woman can do

When you see me comin', raise your window high
When you see me comin', raise your window high
When you see me passing, baby, hang your head and cry

Hurry down sunshine, see what tomorrow brings
Hurry down sunshine, see what tomorrow brings
The sun went down, tomorrow brought us rain

You so mean and evil, you do things you ought not do
You so mean and evil, you do things you ought not do
You've got my brand of honey, guess I'll have to put up with youYou might also likeEmbed
