1 ContributorWhen A Guitar Plays The Blues LyricsYou know you get the strangest feelin'
Yea, when a guitar plays the blues
You know you get the strangest little feelin'
Yea, when a guitar plays the blues
You know your body gets a message
Yea, your soul has got to groove
You know you might even batch your eye
Yea, you might even snatch a cry
Yea the feelin' you're feelin' within ya
Well you know you just can't hide
You got to bend it like that 
You kinda' squeeze it like this 
And it reaches down inside you
Yea, your soul, it just can't resist
'Cause you get the strangest kinda' feelin'
Yea, when a guitar plays the blues
You know your body gets a message
Yea, your soul, your soul, your soul has got to move

And when the music's over
Mmm, it's time to turn out the lights
You know the blues goes home with you
Yea, that sooths you through the night
You might also likeYou get the strangest kinda' feelin'
Yea, when a guitar plays the blues
You know your body gets a message
And your soul, your soul, your soul has got to move
