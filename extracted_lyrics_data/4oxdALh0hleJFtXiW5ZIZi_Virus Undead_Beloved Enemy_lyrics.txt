1 ContributorVirus Undead Lyrics
Twilight falls on withering flesh
Muffled sighs, one final breath
Darkness creeps in to make her claim
Now flows the demon in your veins

She lets the world fall from me
Crumble from reality
There she walks with feet unmoving
Eternally...

Damn you, get out of my head
You are my endless disease
Die if you can, if you please
Damn you, get out of my head
Help me, she lingers on and on
Now death ain't so bad
My virus undead

Wracked with pain, wish you were dеad
But the demon controls your head
With lifеless eyes you search the sky
And pray to God he'll let you die
You might also like
She lets the world fall from me
Crumble from reality
There she walks with feet unmoving
Eternally...

Damn you, get out of my head
You are my endless disease
Die if you can, if you please
Damn you, get out of my head
Help me, she lingers on and on
Now death ain't so bad
My virus undead

She lets the world fall from me
Crumble from reality
There she walks with feet unmoving
Eternally...

Fuck you, get out of my head
You are my virus undead
Fuck you, get out of my head
Fuck you, get out of my head
Fuck you, get out of my headEmbed
