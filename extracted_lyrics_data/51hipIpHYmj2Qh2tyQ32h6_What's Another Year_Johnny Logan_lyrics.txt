13 ContributorsWhatâ€™s Another Year LyricsI've been waiting such a long time
Looking out for you
But you're not here
What's another year?
I've been waking such a long time
Reaching out for you
But you're not near
What's another year?
What's another year
To someone who's lost everything that he owns?
What's another year
To someone who's getting used to being alone?
I've been praying such a long time
It's the only way to hide the fear
What's another year?
What's another year
To someone who's lost everything that he owns?
What's another year
To someone who's getting used to being alone?
I've been crying such a long time
With such a lot of pain in every tear

For someone who is getting used to being alone
What's another year?
To someone who is getting used to being aloneEmbed
