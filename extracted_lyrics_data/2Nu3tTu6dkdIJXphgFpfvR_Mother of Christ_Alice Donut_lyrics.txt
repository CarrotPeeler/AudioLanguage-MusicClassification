Why does it sound so ugly?(Mother of Christ)
Why does it sound so ugly (Mother of Christ)
When I say waht I feel?
And I see the angel's mighty sheath
And I feel the earth and heavens spread
And I see the skewered burnig pit
And I feel the nugget of the seed
I'm the earth mother
I'm the virgin mother
Primordial mother
The virgin mother
And I feel the womb envy within
And I feel the holy conception
And I hear the groans of the damned
And I see the hymens ripped with sin
I'm the earth mother
The virgin mother
Primordial ooze
