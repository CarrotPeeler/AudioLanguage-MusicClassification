6 ContributorsDumb Waiters Lyrics
Give me all your paper ma, give me all your jazz
Give me something that I need, something I can have
Mrs. London's coming 'round she's coming with her son
Gimme all your paper ah so I can get a gun

She has got it in for me
Yeah i mean it honestly

She's so mean

Give me all your paper ma so i can get a train
They just wanna suck you in to being one of them
Tell her that I'm not in here, tell her I'm a freak
Tell her that I fall about every time i speak

She has got in for me
Yeah i mean it honestly

I just scream
Really
You might also like
Give me all your paper ma so i can buy a train
Don't know how i got in here it's making me insane
Have another cigarette and have another cigarette
In a room where lovers go talking on the telephone

They have got it in for me
Yeah I mean it honestly

They all dream
