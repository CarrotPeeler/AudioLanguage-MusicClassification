1 ContributorMind The Wires LyricsMind the wires that surround us
Slow down, slow down be careful
A million stars may shine down on us
But these words, these words never will
Looks like rain's here
Clear a way for the same mistakes
We know, we know itâ€™s over
Say goodbye, but then stay a while
We feel love, feel love in-between
Looks like rain's hereYou might also likeEmbed
