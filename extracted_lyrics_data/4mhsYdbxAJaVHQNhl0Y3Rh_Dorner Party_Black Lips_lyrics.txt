3 ContributorsDorner Party Lyrics
If you're trying to find me, well you're gonna
But I won't be staying with my mother
I'm gonna lose control
I'm going out on my own patrol
But you won't see me with another

I don't think I'll run away
Maybe I will some other day
But for now, I'm back a while, I'll say
Why don't you come out here and play?

I'm looking down on you from the hilltop
I can't tell a Ranger from a real cop
They seem like just the same
All out to smear my name
What can I do to make them all stop?

I don't think I'll run away
Maybe I will some other day
But for now, I'm back a while, I'll say
Why don't you come out here and play?
You might also like
Well my mind is burning with this reason
Cause you can't burn a house down in this season
Get the cameras out of here
But you can shoot from over there
Never mind the fire, cause we'll freeze him

I don't think I'll run away
Maybe I will some other day
But for now, I'm back a while, I'll say
Why don't you come out here and play?Embed
