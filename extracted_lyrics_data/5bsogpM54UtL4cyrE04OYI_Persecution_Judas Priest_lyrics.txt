We're watching you
Nowhere to hide
Obey the holy laws
Repent for your sins
There is but one God

Against their holy laws
I'll do whatever it takes
I've met their kind before
We're martyrs burned at their stake

They try to dominate
I'll be a thorn in their side
They underestimate
The willpower feeding my pride

Under the hand of persecution
Defy the institution

Their words just crucify
Condemning truth that I seek
They cannot justify
The pain, the havoc they wreak

I never will conform
My faith is deep to the core
I stand against reform
I'll never kneel down before

Under the hand of persecution
Defy the institution

With raised fists of fire
As they conspire
I'll be defiant
Against the alliance

They will not eradicate me
Break my will or suffocate me
I will subjugate the hate
That they breed
As the church interrogates
I cannot see they supplicate me
Execute and ridicule
We're all freed

I never will conform
My faith is deep to the core
I stand against reform
I'll never kneel down before

Under the hand of persecution
Defy the institution
Under the hand of persecution
Defy the institution
