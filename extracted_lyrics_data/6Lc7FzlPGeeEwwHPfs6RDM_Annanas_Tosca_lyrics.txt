2 ContributorsAnanas Lyrics
Oh take me to the rooftop
From where we can see all the lights of paradise
There's probably a band
Playin' over there the songs we love to hear when we feel just like that oh
Do we really have the time
To share a drink and smoke a cigarette outside
Until suddenly the wind will rise
And all together we'll be boarding on the same flight, yeah

Do you believе we're gonna get thеre?
Do you believe we're gonna get there?
Do you believe we're gonna get there?
Do you believe we're gonna get there? (Ah)
Do you believe we're gonna get there?
Do you believe we're gonna get there?
Do you believe we're gonna get there?
Do you believe we're gonna get there? (Ah)
Do you believe we're gonna get there?
Do you believe we're gonna get there?
Do you believe we're gonna get there?
Do you believe we're gonna get there? (Ah)
Do you believe we're gonna get there?
Do you believe we're gonna get there?
Do you believe we're gonna get there?
Do you believe we're gonna get there? (Ah)
You might also like
And if there's no way to forget the pains
Over there we'll feel at least fine
And if there's no way to forget the pains
Over there we'll try to stop the time
And if there's no way to forget the pains
Over there we'll merge in the crowd
And if there's no way to forget the pains
Over there we'll try not to die, try not to die

Do you believe we're gonna get there?
Do you believe we're gonna get there?
Do you believe we're gonna get there?
Do you believe we're gonna get there?
Do you believe we're gonna get there?
Do you believe we're gonna get there?
Do you believe we're gonna get there?
Do you believe we're gonna get there?
Do you believe we're gonna get there?
Do you believe we're gonna get there?
Do you believe we're gonna get there?
Do you believe we're gonna get there? (Ah)
Do you believe we're gonna get there?
Do you believe we're gonna get there?
Do you believe we're gonna get there?
Do you believe we're gonna get there? (Ah)Embed
