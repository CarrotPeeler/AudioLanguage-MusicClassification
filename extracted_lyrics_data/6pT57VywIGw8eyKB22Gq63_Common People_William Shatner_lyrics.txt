5 ContributorsCommon People Lyrics
She came from Greece, she had a thirst for knowledge
She studied sculpture at Saint Martin's College
That's where I caught her eye
She told me that her dad was loaded
I said, in that case I'll have a rum and Coca Cola
She said fine and in thirty seconds time she said
I wanna live like common people
I wanna do whatever common people do
I wanna sleep with common people
I wanna sleep with common people like you
Well, what else could I do?
I said, I'll see what I can do
I took her to a supermarket
I don't know why, but I had to start it somewhere
So it started there
I said, pretend you've got no money
She just laughed and said, oh, you're so funny
I said, yeah? Well I can't see anyone else smiling in here
Are you sure you want to live like common people?
You want to see whatever common people see?
You want to sleep with common people?
You want to sleep with common people like me?
But she didn't understand
She just smiled and held my hand
Rent a flat above a shop
Cut your hair and get a job
Smoke some fags and play some pool
Pretend you never went to school
But still you'll never get it right
When you're lyin' in bed at night
Watching roaches climb the wall
If you call your dad he could stop it all
You'll never live like common people
You'll never do whatever common people do
You'll never fail like common people
You'll never watch your life slide out of view
And dance, and drink, and screw
Because there's nothing else to do
Sing along with the common people
Sing along and it might just get you through
Laugh along with the common people
Laugh along, even though they're laughing at you
And the stupid things that you do
'Cause you think that "poor" is cool
Like a dog lying in a corner
It'll bite you and never warn you
Look out, they'll tear your insides out
Because everybody hates a tourist
'Cause everybody hates a tourist
'Specially one who thinks it's all such a laugh
Yeah and the chip stains' grease will come out in the bath
You will never understand
How it feels to live your life
With no meaning or control
And with nowhere left to go
You're amazed that they exist
And they burn so bright, while
You can only wonder why
You might also likeRent a flat above a shop
Cut your hair and get a job
Smoke some fags and play some pool
Pretend you never went to school
But still you'll never get it right
When you've laid in bed at night
Watching roaches climb the wall
If you call your dad he could stop it all
You'll never live like common people
You'll never do what common people do
You'll never fail like common people
You'll never watch your life slide out of view
And dance and drink and screw
Because there's nothing else to do

Wanna sleep with the common people like you
Wanna sleep with the common people like you
Wanna sleep with the common people like youEmbed
