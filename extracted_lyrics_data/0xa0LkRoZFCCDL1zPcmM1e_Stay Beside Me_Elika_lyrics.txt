1 ContributorClown Fiesta LyricsHuh… welcome welcome, one and all— to the Fiesta Circus
We chew bubblegum, have faulty cerebellums n twisted circuits
With sienna skin color and a miasma of sourness
Quite the dilemma, we offer disservice
And expect you to make a purchase
I mean please would you take a look at this
Miyaneen indish bil6ofa chinna man7is
Me I need digits, numba go up, neva minus
I keep it three hunnid choofa Leonidas
I jus worry bout this carnival up in my head
Thought train off the rails, must be the bread
Budder rain in the mental plains of this bedlam
Dumb? No, numb, vocals strum a mogul’s hum
Bum some drums frumma chum so duh bumdadum come
Crumbs of funds become a big lump sum
But we go n waste it, partyin n makin stupid investments
Move in random directions, no rhyme or reason for the vestments
Pocket lint n wood splints, inventory of junk contents
No context, inninet disconnects, nottinuff cents
But it makes no sense to and fro innocence
Toxic one moment, docile then hostile the next
L 2 P fo you hate on me too E Z f’yuh not to have a GG
I cud put you on yo ass a couple mo times
Make yuh rage quit all the way back to mommy
I mean sorry, don’t mean to spread toxicity
Iont gamble but I like lettin fate decide fo me
I won’t worry bout y’ass y’just slide off o me
Brambles spike fast whenya strike, self-fatality
L 2 P fo you hate on me too E Z f’yuh not to have a GG
I cud put you on yo ass a couple mo times
Make yuh rage quit all the way back to mommy
I mean sorry, don’t mean to spread toxicity
Iont gamble but I like lettin fate decide fo me
I won’t worry bout y’ass y’just slide off o me
Brambles spike fast whenya strike, self-fatality

Deem the right target, noc dun need lights
Seems like we’ve impeded enemy sights
White beams, ults, do it all, unleash a blight
But the curtain pull back to reveal a plight
Counter engaged now imma runna gunna
Tanks droppin while I’m kitin, stay alive life stealuh
Chitin cross bolts shreddin plate, armor penetratuh
Elias beside me says dassa nice quadra, go f’the penta
Type o dude to take it from yuh, ninja kill stealuh
Tawwuh muh brutha frum anotha motha
Basha, said don’t worry bout it cuz he be doin it all the time
Drop a dime read signs make great finds then wine and dine
Mime drinkin cuz I’m too busy makin high limes
Sour but got that kick that’s ever so divine
Fox McCloud shine on em, combo game so sublime
L 2 P fo you hate on me too E Z f’yuh not to have a GG
I cud put you on yo ass a couple mo times
Make yuh rage quit all the way back to mommy
I mean sorry, don’t mean to spread toxicity
Iont gamble but I like lettin fate decide fo me
