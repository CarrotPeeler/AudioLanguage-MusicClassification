1 ContributorOpen House At My House Lyrics
I’ve got a friend that lives across the street
He knows where your birthmark is baby
And how many corns you have on your feet
Ain’t no way he could know this baby
Unless you been doin me wrong
It must be open house at my house baby
Lord every time, every time that I'm gone

We went to church last Sunday
We invited the preacher to our house
He told you make the best fried chicken
It just melts in your mouth
Ain’t no way he could know that baby
Unless he’s tasted it before
It must be open house at my house baby
Lord every time, every time I hit the door

My foreman lives in the neighbourhood
And his yard is next to mine
I noticed that fence is sagging baby
Between his yard and mine
Oh he must be coming pretty often baby
Cos the trail is about two inches deep
Don’t try to tell me woman
Don’t try to tell me that he's been walkin in his sleep
You might also likeAnd one more thing I wanna say baby

I went down to the service station
To fill up my car
The man told me just how much money
I had in my cookie jar
Ain’t no way he could know that baby
Unless he’s been dipping his fingers in my cookie jar
Oh I know cos I’ve been told
The whole neighbourhood’s been dipping in my sugar bowl
And one more thing I wanna tell you right here

I’ve got another friend
But lives next door
He knows what colour ? I’ve got
And what kind of carpet I’ve got on my wall
Ain’t no way he could know that baby
Lord he must’ve been walking barefoot on my rug
You must be kissing the whole neighbourhood baby
And lord knows how many people you’ve hugged

Must be open house in my house baby
Home just don’t seem like home no doggone more
Oh baby
Home just don’t seem like home no doggone more
It must be open house at my house baby
Every time, every time I hit the doorEmbed
