1 ContributorHeart Pie Dancehall (Official English Cover) 「HIMEHINA」【Will Stetson】 LyricsHeart Pie Dancehall, A beating Bolero
With a melting gaze, he drives me crazy
Lemon licks my lips, a sour love
Raise a toast, one more drink before you go
Keep singing, babe
Don't keep me waiting here again
Cause the beat never ends when we're dancin'
(Heart Pie Dancehall!)
Baby, Come and pour another drink
(Heart Pie Dancehall)
Count out to the ending of Pie: 3.1415926535
There are still feelings and a question I can never decide
Every sort of Angel, a cradle ever still
When the very stars above were all aligning
Not want of trying, But heaven is still yet to fall in line
Isn't it a pretty night?
Come and
Oh eh oh eh oh eh oh eh oh
Dance into the morning light!
In a spinning trance you carry me close
No more crying
Pitiful tears will burden your heart
Starting the party, Gandaara Sansaara
What're you saying?
You and me, Dancing in the twighlight
Beaming hearts sound like the wi-fi
In the heavy lights you will find
I love and want you here right by my side
When I bend and look from the skyline
Things all blend together within my mind
Papa pa pa pa pai!
Pie?
Heart Pie!
Hard finding, Loving overflows
With a melting gaze, he drives me crazy
Lemon licks my lips, a sour taste  and
Oh my god! Where's this feeling meant to go?
When it's sweet and tender
No surrender!
Not a clue and i'm toast, ah
Papa ra pa pa pa!
All the glamorous stars and the hollywood bars:
They know the heart pie
I dream of when all the people are moving!
Dance halls alive, the music makes are zeroes 
Cheers, Baby!
Today we Bolero
Everybody laughing, In the dancing
Here we go
Come on and raise another toast!
Our goal on the board is making noise to have your body faster
Like a slice of a microwave pie it's stammering
The brain inside is slow to go and realise
In a haze, I dance with you all night
Forgetting sense, I swim in your cool eyes
It's a glimpse of heaven above, ah
Papa pa pa papa
Pie!
All of you, Up: Let's go!
Dance time!
(Heart Pie Dancehall)
Ah, La la
(Heart Pie Dancehall)
(Heart Pie Dancehall)
When we are brought into the world
Our very own first sound is of the heart inside us beating slow!
(Taton Taton Taton Taton Taten Tatonta!)
There we learn a very simple rhythm
Way into the past, Go and run it back!
Heartbeats each unite our fellow man
I'm sure that even you understand?
Papa pa pa pa Pai!
Pie?
Heart pie!
Hard finding, Love overflows
With a melting gaze, he drives me crazy
Lemon licks my lips, a sour taste and
Oh my god! Where's this feeling meant to go?
When it's sweet and tender
No surrender!
Not a clue and i'm toast, ah
Papa ra pa pa pa!
La La La La La La La La La La
Along the virgin road
We all were dancing to the melody
Starting all again, A life where we'd always sing
Cheers, Baby!
Today we Bolero!
Everybody laughing, In the dancing
Here we go!
Terete Terete Tete
Are you feeling down?
Everything is wrapping up and running out
Repeating lines, pie, going til our bodies hit the ground
What happens? I guess we'll never know!
Here we go!
Heart Pie Dancehall
A beating bolero
With a melting gaze, he drives me crazy
Lemon licks my lips, a sour sweetened love
So baby, take another bite
If nothing else, You won't be dancing on your own
Come on and raise another toast
(Heart Pie Dancehall)
Baby, Come and pour another drink
(Heart Pie Dancehall)
