2 ContributorsAm i right or wrong LyricsOnce I was a tumblin' weed
Like a rollin' stone, cold and all alone
Living for the day my train would come
Never cared for school or any golden rules
And papa used to always say I was a useless fool
So I left my home to show them they was wrong
And headed out on the road singing my song
Then one sunny day, the man he looked my way
And everything that I dreamed of, it was real
Money, girls and cars and big long cigars
And I caught the first plane home so papa would see
Yeah when I went home to show 'em they was wrong
All that I found Lord was two tombstones
Somebody tell me please was I right or wrong
Lord it's such a sad song
Now first I got lost then I got found
But the ones that I loved are in the ground
Papa I only wish you could see me now
Take a listen papa
I learnt how to play my guitar
Some people say I'm gonna be a superstar
Smoking big on long cigars
You might also likeHold on for a moment now
If there's any way, you can hear what I say
Papa, I never meant to do you wrong
All the money, girls and cars and all the words, the long cigars
Papa, I just want you to know, they couldn't take your place
Give it to me
Oh yeah when I went home to show 'em they was wrong
All that I found Lord was two tombstones
Somebody tell me please was I right or wrong
Lord it's such a sad song
Now first I got lost, then I got found
But the ones that I love are in the ground
Somebody tell me please was I right or wrong
Once I was a tumblin' weed
Like a rollin' stone, cold and all aloneEmbed
