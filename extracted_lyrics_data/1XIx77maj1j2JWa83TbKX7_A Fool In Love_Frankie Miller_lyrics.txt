2 ContributorsNot Your Usual Lyrics
(The Circle)

Ayy, if it's a body for a body, we gon' chalk it out
I did some shit up in these streets that I can't talk about
We walk 'em down, no attempts, leave 'em on the ground
I'm top rank up in this shit, I be they listen now
When I was down bad, I ain't have my hand out
Granny whipped my ass, she found my guns in the damn couch
I ain't finna argue on the 'net, these niggas fanned out
I don't need no diamonds on my neck, I still stand out

If it's blue sight on the blick, make my aim better
300K in the vault next to the vacuum sealer
I like molly, but I'm fallin' in love with painkillers
I'll sacrifice еnough to fuck a bitch, Kylie Jenner
I'll stop sеllin' dog for that one letter
Get back to scammin' on that ass if it involve an M
I ain't got friends, I got stans, I feel like Eminem
Shh, I told the bitch it's either me or them

I had a trunk full of bales while my ex was drivin'
If my plug go to jail, he gettin' extradited
A hundred K off one play, now the bezel shinin'
Diamonds clearer than a runway when the jet arrivin'
I touch down down in Wayne County just to catch the Lions
A nigga fly every day, they thinkin' Fre$h a pilot
Yeah, we slide with guns, think it's John Salley
Or just hit you with the TEC like Silicon Valley
You might also like
Ayy, I know these lil' bitches fraud and they ain't 'bout it
Was a shorty with a 40 and they knew I was a savage
I ain't in the audience, but I'm so used to all this cappin'
And I got a lot to lose, so I can't get caught lackin'

Hit your block with this blick, throw your Crocs in sport
Put the switch on a bitch, yeah, the Glockies of course
Bench Warren, sip the Act' 'cause I don't go to court
We gon' hold court, pop his head like a fuckin' cork
Get his man too, smoke his ass like a fuckin' 'Port
Fuck a camera, put it on live and let 'em screen record
For the record, I just scratched another opp up off the board
For the record, she just stuffed a grip, but she can stuff more

For the cheddar, she gon' start to strip until her muscles sore
I'm cut from a different cloth, you niggas soft as a velour
I been sippin' lean since Act' was comin' out of Baltimore
That's why you never see us countin' for (Push that shit out, Skilla)

Huh, lock in so I can wear my kit around Bompton
I get a nigga shot or beat him up, Bernard Hopkins
My young nigga don't really kill shit, but he be robbin'
Huh, I only want the killers in The Circle, nigga gon' sign 'em
I wonder if she like my dick more or my diamonds
My fiend a fool, fell in love with the food, Frankie Lymon
Huh, I keep steppin' on these niggas' necks, they need the Heimlich
I'll noodle me a nigga, turn his brain into ramen
I was down bad, then I got with The Circle, perfect timin'
Lil' bro tote a four-five, boy, that bitch'll drop a lineman
Grew up mannish, seventh grade, I was breakin' bitches' hymens
You be on that bitch ass, young dog, I be behind it
I'm the shit, I'll say that shit a million times, now you reminded
I was tricked into the game, the gold chains had me blinded
I be talkin' 'bout my life, it just so happen it be rhymin'
Niggas be doin' what I say like I'm SimonEmbed
