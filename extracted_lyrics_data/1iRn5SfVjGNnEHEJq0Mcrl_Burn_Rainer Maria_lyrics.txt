And I'm a tyrant sentencing
You said that you believed in me
And would burn for your beliefs
I watched you burn
Burn for me
I watched you burn
Burn for me
Love's some kind of sorcery
An inquisition's questioning
You said that you believed in me
And to take you on sometime
You said that you believed in me
And would burn for your beliefs
I watched you burn
I watched you burn for me
I watched you burn
Burn for me
But now I wonder how
I stood by
I let you down
Maybe I couldn't see
That you would burn for me
You were strong and clever
And I didn't know any better
I didn't know any better
I could have set you free
But I watched you burn
I could have set you free
But I watched you burnYou might also likeEmbed
