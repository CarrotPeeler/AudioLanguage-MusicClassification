5 ContributorsThat 70s Song Lyrics
And lately I've been walking
From all these places that I cannot stand
I guess it's just my history talking
Or I'm refusing to supply your demands

You say the storm will pass
We'll work it out
The roads can get a little rough sometimes
I'll move it fast without a doubt
Our hearts will beat in separate rooms tonight
But tonight

Baby, we belong alone
Guess my second chance is blown
Baby, we belong alone
I got another you at home
Baby, we belong alone, alone

And lately you've been knocking
But I never really listened or cared
Cause when I told you I was walking
I was reeling her in with my stare
You might also like
You say the storm will pass
We'll work it out
The roads can get a little rough sometimes
I'll move it fast without a doubt
Our hearts will beat in separate rooms tonight
But tonight

Baby, we belong alone
Guess my second chance is blown
Baby, we belong alone
I got another you at home
Baby, we belong alone, alone

Baby, we belong alone
Guess my second chance is blown
Baby, we belong alone
I got another you at home
Baby, we belong alone
Guess my second chance is blown
Baby, we belong alone
I got another you at home
Baby, we belong alone, aloneEmbed
