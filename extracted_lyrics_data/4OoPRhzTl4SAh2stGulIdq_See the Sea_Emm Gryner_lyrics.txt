4 ContributorsOn The Radio Lyrics
I guess we're sittin' on the park on this one
You know what I'm sayin'?
You wanna just, uh, bring it back real quick
For my real hip hop fans
That just miss how it used to feel
Before this radio shit
Check it

Yo
I'm looking for a place to chill
For a place to display my skills
For a place to build
To express how I feel inside
For a place to just vibe and rhyme
Kick back and relax
Till my tracks all maxin' rap
Without old folks callin' it crap
It's my pen and my pad
No (?) shit, politics in it, just spittin' in it
Bust rhythms gettin' love and respect
No checks, no rapping for sex
No crap about a jag or a lex
I'm not having it broke
I want a home where The Roots go platinum
Common is common in households and Mos Def ain't actin'
Tribe is back together, and Jam Master J stay rockin' his leather
Where the records get more played than CDs please
Ain't no super scientifical MC's
You gotta be real, gotta be ill with delivery
No mimicking nobody just writing the tightest symphony
Feeling me dawg? I wanna stay where the real emcees are
Where the illest beats are, fuck the industry, dawg
Where the backyards are shows, and hoes that just backup singers for pros
And my flows and tracks go together forever
Next to us and so
And four doors down, it's rock and roll
I wanna go
You might also like
Feels like hip-hop's lost its soul
Every time I'm on the road
Ain't no matter where I go
Same shit's on the radio
See the sea and show the shore
Any place that's on the go
Ain't no matter where I go
Same shit's on the radio

Instead of playing this, they'd rather be playing that
And instead of making hits, they'd rather be making crap
They label it as rap and all they talk about is mix this drink that
Crap in, they crap out
Instead of playing this, they'd rather be playing that
And instead of making hits, they'd rather be making crap
They label it as rap and all they talk about is mix this drink that
Crap in, they crap out

I'm looking for a place to rhyme
For a place to let shit off my mind
Kick back and recline
Write verses about the women I'm feelin'
And I could spit a couple to 'em and they won't get offended
Shit, I'm looking for a place where I could say what I like
Come out the studio feeling right, from lacing it tight
Take it right to the stage and display it on mics
Repeat it every single day of my life
Just like heaven and me
Picture droppin' music freely
Without checkin' weekly how many people went and got your CD
Without labels being greedy, taking paper from the needy
The grass is even greener than a (?) CD
See we don't want money
Sip some change a piece
My niggas don't lose brains to beef
And when I play beats
And when you ask and I say it's JD
Y'all know I don't mean Jermaine Dupri's
So shame these lames, these things need to gauge the test
And the lakers best play without a rape suspect
Trying to find a place where you ain't got to take no vest
And a bitch-ass Nelly would never step to KRS
This whole place is a mess
Trying to find a way up out of this
And hip-hop is like my Wizard of Oz, yes
I'm like Dorothy, except my ruby slippers are chrome
Click three times, I'm trying to go home, y'all
I'm trying to go home
Feels like hip-hop's lost its soul
Every time I'm on the road
Ain't no matter where I go
Same shit's on the radio
Sea to sea and show to show
Any place that's on the go
Ain't no matter where I go
Same shit's on the radioEmbed
