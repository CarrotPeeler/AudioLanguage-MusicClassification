Will I ever know the ache in you?
Will your soul sooth over the toil in you my love
Or will the pain ever soften?
If I lose you tonight my love
Will your heaving lull within?
Will you eclipse the toil within your heart my love
Or will your soul build a haven?
If I lose you tonight my love
Will you hold fort around the blue?
Will you guard the wall around your heart my love?
Is there a furrow left to step through?
If I lose you tonight my love
Will the sombre dispel and thin?
Will the sadness behind your eyes weave my love
And let a crevice small to begin?
If I lose you tonight my love
Will you ever know my toil within?
Will you ever know the ache inside my soul
And that your aching is familiar?
For I moulded a furrow small
I furrowed more till the crevice tilled
A chink of airy light began to fill my love
To fill the sombre heart again
You might also likeI won't lose you tonight my love
I won't leave your furrow untilled
I won't leave you tonight my love
Until the airy ray has broken in
I won't leave you tonight my love
I won't leave your furrow untilled
I won't leave you tonight my love
Until the airy ray has broken inEmbed
