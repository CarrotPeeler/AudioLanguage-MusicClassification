There's something going on
It fill you up, it fill you up, it fill you up now
There's something going on
It fill you up, it fill you up, it fill you up now
But you don't know what it is
But you don't know what it is
But you don't have to know
You just take it for what it is

Within this melody
It fill you up, it fill you up, it fill you up now
There's more than you can see
It fill you up, it fill you up, it fill you up now
There's another realm
There's another world
With kings and queens
Yeah, yeah

That's why you gotta testify
It fill you up, it fill you up, it fill you up now (Uh huh)
You gotta do and die
It fill you up, it fill you up, it fill you up now
You gotta stay in the music and move
You gotta turn on the music and groove
Every, every, every day
You know what I'm talking about
It fill you up, it fill you up
You might also like
It fill you up, it fill you up, it fill you up now (Yeah)
It fill you up, it fill you up, it fill you up now (Yeah)
It fill you up, it fill you up, it fill you up now
Get you rolling in the morning
It fill you up, it fill you up, it fill you up now
Work out a few kinks
It fill you up, it fill you up, it fill you up now
It fill you up to the brim, Jim
It fill you up, it fill you up, it fill you up now
Lord have mercy
It fill you up, it fill you up, it fill you up now
It fill you up, it fill you up, it fill you up now
Come here, baby
It fill you up, it fill you up, it fill you up nowEmbed
