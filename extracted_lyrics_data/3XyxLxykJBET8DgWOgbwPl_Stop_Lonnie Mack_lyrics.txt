1 ContributorStop LyricsI wish you could see me one time
Just love me like I love you
You take what you need
And I take whatever you want me to
I'm just a poor fool but I love you
And if I'm a fool then that's what I'll be
You got to stop hurting me
So many nights I tried to tell you
You puling me down baby
Making me cry, driving me crazy
You got to stop hurting me
You got to stop yeah you got to stop baby
You got to stop hurting me, yeah
So many nights I tried to tell you
You puling me down baby
Making me cry, driving me crazy
You got to stop hurting me
You got to stop yeah you got to stop baby
You got to stop baby hurting me, yeah
You got to stop baby
You got to stop baby
You got to stop babyYou might also likeEmbed
