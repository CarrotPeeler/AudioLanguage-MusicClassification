Devil girl, you love me then you hate me
You told me I was cute then gave me the boot
Devil girl
Devil girl, take me to the chamber
Devil girl, riding on a reindeer
You got me all hot but somehow you're not
Devil girl, devil girl
Ooh
Satan rules
Ooh baby in your cloven flip-flops
Devil baby, power over the jukebox
This music of desire has set my world on fire
Devil girl
Devil girl, forced me to drink the potion
Devil girl, told me to use the lotion
You told me I was cute then gave me the boot
Devil girl, devil girl
