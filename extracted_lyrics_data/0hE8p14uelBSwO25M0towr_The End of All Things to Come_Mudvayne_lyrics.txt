8 ContributorsThe End of All Things to Come Lyrics
(All over with)
Fuck all the flags, the greed, the world leaders!
(Run for the fence)
We're coming, we're killing, we're changing the faces!
(Believe in yourself)
Let go of ego, strengthen within yourself!
(All over with)
We're coming, we're killing, we're changing the faces!

I'm killing every fuckin' thing
Until somebody gets this fuckin' point
The point I'm trying to make
I lead the mice on parade
Down to the river of Kool-Aid
And open up the flood gates
I need a barrel of cyanide
A pile of strychnine
Until the whole damn world is dead
Start over again

(All over with)
Fuck all the flags, the greed, the world leaders!
(Run for the fence)
We're coming, we're killing, we're changing the faces!
You might also like
Stop talking, negotiating
Your feeble attempts toward world peace
Ah, give me a fuckin' break!
Need worldwide genocide, planetary suicide
And when the whole damn world is dead
There's your fuckin' peace!

(All over with)
Fuck all the flags, the greed, the world leaders!
(Run for the fence)
We're coming, we're killing, we're changing the faces!
(Believe in yourself)
Let go of ego, strengthen within yourself!
(All over with)
We're coming, we're killing, we're changing the faces!

Oxygen wasters!
Come on!
We've come to save you (Save you from yourselves)
Kill, or be killed!
We've come to save you (Save you from yourselves)
Kill, or be killed!
(All over with)
Fuck all the flags, the greed, the world leaders!
(Run for the fence)
We're coming, we're killing, we're changing the faces!
(Believe in yourself)
Let go of ego, strengthen within yourself!
(All over with)
We're coming, we're killing, we're changing the faces!Embed
