18 ContributorsThe Hymn of Acxiom LyricsSomebody hears you. You know that. You know that
Somebody hears you. You know that inside
Someone is learning the colors of all your moods, to
(say just the right thing and) show that you’re understood
Here you’re known
Leave your life open. You don’t have. You don’t have
Leave your life open. You don’t have to hide
Someone is gathering every crumb you drop, these
(mindless decisions and) moments you long forgot
Keep them all
Let our formulas find your soul
We’ll divine your artesian source (in your mind)
Marshal feed and force (our machines will)
To design you a perfect love—
Or (better still) a perfect lust
O how glorious, glorious: a brand new need is born
Now we possess you. You’ll own that. You’ll own that
Now we possess you. You’ll own that in time
Now we will build you an endlessly upward world
(reach in your pocket) embrace you for all you’re worth
Is that wrong?
Isn’t this what you want?
AmenYou might also like1Embed
