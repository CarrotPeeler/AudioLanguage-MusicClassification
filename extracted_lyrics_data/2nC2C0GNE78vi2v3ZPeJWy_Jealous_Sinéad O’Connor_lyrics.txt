5 ContributorsJealous Lyrics
You're jealous
You just can't stand to see me get along without you
Like I do, you told me to
Now you're jealous
You don't know how hard it was to be alone without you
And wanting you, like I do

I would've stayed if you'd wanted
Would have been willing
But you said I treat you so badly I can't be forgiven
You know I would have done anything
To make it through with you
But I don't deserve to be lonely
Just 'cause you say I do

You're jealous
You don't know how hard it is to be a woman in love with you
When you're so cruel, and so jealous
You don't think about anybody's feelings but your own
Are you coming home?

I would've stayed if you'd wanted
Would have been willing
But you said I treat you so badly I can't be forgiven
You know I would have done anything
To make it through with you
But I don't deserve to be lonely
Just 'cause you say I do
You might also likeSo if you're gonna go you've gotta go and if you're staying, stay
'Cause I can't take the pain you keep leaving when you go away
If you're gonna go you've gotta go and if you're staying, stay
'Cause I can't take the pain you keep leaving when you go away
I don't deserve to be so lonely
I don't deserve to cry, ohhhh
I don't deserve to be so lonelyEmbed
