1 ContributorMorning Lyrics
A thousand parchment high
Outstretched in attitude of prayer
To sky that answered, not at all
Was there alone and calloused, alone
Alone and calloused

The man of gentle voices
Was asking only time
From sky that answered, not at all
Was there alone and calloused, alone
Alone and calloused

The silent streets of emptiness
Awaited only dawn
In sky that answered, not at all
Was there alone and calloused, alone
Alone and calloused


Astral shadowed darkly
Astral  couldn't family 
Why, why?
With a carl–µss wave of her hair
Dawn is standing through the night and
Why, why?
Why, why?
Why, why?

Guess who's waiting on the corner
Will the man of gentle voices try to order
On the coldest evening into everyday

In the morning, quite excited
Truely strange but still delighted
Everythings going faster, faster, faster
Everythings going faster, faster, faster
Was it gleaming as a fire?
Lightning flashing passing by her
Everythings going faster, faster, faster
Everythings going faster, faster, faster
This is the day and it's passing away
Comforting meanings are passing away


The man of gentle voices
Was asking only time
From sky that answered, not at all
Was there alone and calloused, alone
Alone and calloused
The silent streets of emptiness
Awaited only dawn
In sky that answered, not at all
Was there alone and calloused, alone
Alone and calloused, alone
Ah, ah
