1 ContributorThe True Church of God Lyrics"the true church of Jesus Christ is so much more
Then the buildings made of wood and stone
I love Jesus, i don't need any institution
Between him and me, just god and me
No priests, no churches
The first words in Jesus gospel are a kingdom of god
Is inside you and all around you. not in a buildings of wood and stone
Spare a piece of wood and i'm there. leave the stone
And you'll find me."
What's this, this is not
What i want to read
Guess he gave his life for this deceit
Tell me what about the true church of god
Is he all around or is he not
Why do we need your church
Why do we have to pay
Now absolution
The demon does it for free
Why do we need your church
Why do we have to pay
Now absolution
The demon does it for free
