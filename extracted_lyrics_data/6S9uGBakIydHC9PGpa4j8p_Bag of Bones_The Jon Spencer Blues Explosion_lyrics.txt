1 ContributorBag of Bones LyricsGood morning
Everybody got to get up
Are you ready for your new career?
Need a J, O, B
Come on
Get up
Have you heard about?
You got to go ask you mother
To get up
Come on
And I’m an old mean man
And I gon’ take that risk
Don’t got to wait to for halloween to scream and wail
Bag of bones I’m gonna put you there
And I’m an old bag of bones
But believe I get down
Come on
You got to try a little bit harder
Yeah
You got to think about it
You got to get your head out of the past
Get down
Stop pulling on my chain you cheap marionette
There’s a short cut to hell through the discothèque
A bag of bones ain’t no zombie brain
Activate the body
Reject the same
Pick it up
Aye
Do you remember the 1990s?
Do you remember the 1980s?
Do you remember the 1970s?
Too many squares
Too many slogans
Too many slogans
Too many squares
Too much mediocrity
Pick it up
Man of my nature always got to trip
‘Cause the jazz that you pushing make you sound like a drip
I need something weird, I need something strange
I’m a mean bag of bones don’t got to explain
That’s right
Bag of bones I’m gon’ put you down
And I’m an old bag of bones
Honey, you’re just a clown
Fuck
Come on
Bones
Got to
Make bone
You got you hip bone
You got your ear bone
You got your, ha ha ha, funny boneYou might also likeEmbed
