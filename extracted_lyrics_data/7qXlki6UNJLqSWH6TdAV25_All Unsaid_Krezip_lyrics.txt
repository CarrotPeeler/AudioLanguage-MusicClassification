1 ContributorAll Unsaid LyricsIf you were here now
Then I would tell you, this is not the way
Then I would force you
To make your choices and get out of my way
Just scream
But there's no one there to hear or hold your hand
I'd rather talk to you, than leave it all unsaid
It's all unsaid, it's all unsaid
Don't run away now, it's not my choice
Don't try to make it feel that way
Did all I could, but your heart is empty
So I won't let you win
Just scream
But there's no one there to hear or hold your hand
I'd rather talk to you, than leave it all unsaid
It's all unsaid, it's all unsaid
Hey, if you think I don't mean it well
Then I can't help you further, no
You don't have to do it on your own, on your own no
How far did you think I'd go
Begging you until I die
Well I won't let it come that far, I won't
You might also likeJust scream
But there's no one there to hear or hold your hand
I'd rather talk to you, than leave it all unsaid
It's all unsaid, it's all unsaidEmbed
