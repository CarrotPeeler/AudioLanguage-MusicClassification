Girl, let's fall in love, think it over, girl
Come a little closer, girl
Hey, let's fall in love, think it over, girl
Come a little closer, girl

All of my life
I've wondered when love would be
I like to spend my time
In your company, you and me

Let's fall in love, think it over, girl
Come a little closer, girl
Hey, let's fall in love, think it over, girl
Come a little closer, girl

Everybody needs someone to love
Darling, it's you I've been dreamin' of
And I wanna be the one you love
The story's been told for me
By the stars above, stars above

Fall in love, think it over, girl
Come a little closer, girl
Fall in love, think it over, girl
Come closer, girl
You might also like
Whenever you're near
Good feelings come over me, over me, baby
Now that I found your love
Life is so complete, so complete

Girl, let's fall in love, think it over, girl
Come a little closer, girl
Hey, let's fall in love, think it over
Get a little closer, girl

Everybody needs someone to love
Darling, it's you I've been dreamin' of
And I wanna be the one you love
The story's been told to me
By the stars above, stars above

Fall in love, think it over, girl
Come a little closer, girl
Fall in love, think it over, girl
Come a little closer, girl
Fall in loveEmbed
