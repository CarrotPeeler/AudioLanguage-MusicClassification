1 ContributorSimplicity (original) LyricsAbsolutely
Beautifully
Come to my mind
Deep thoughts I can't hide
Eagerly seek
Find what I think
Given to you
Hope will take you through
SIM-PLI-CI-TY
I search within
Joy I can bring
Kindness for sure
Love and nothing more
Marvelously
Naturally
Others don't know, so
Please let me show
SIM-PLI-CI-TY
