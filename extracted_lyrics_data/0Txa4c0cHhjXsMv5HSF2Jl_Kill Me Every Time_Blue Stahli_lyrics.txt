5 ContributorsKill Me Every Time Lyrics
(Take me, break me)
(Take me, break me)

You kill me every time
You kill me every time

I feel your last conviction and I'm underneath
You kissed me with a bullet between your teeth
You like the way that I struggle, you're my favorite sin
I'm playing the willing victim and when I give in

You kill me every time (You kill me every time)
You kill me every time (You kill me every time)

And you break me (You kill me every time)
And you take me (You kill me every time)
And you break me (You kill me every time)
And you take me (You kill me every time)
And you break me, break me

Go down a little lower, taste your skin
Move in a little slower, breathe you in
Swallowing all submission and I suffocate
One last inhibition to penetrate
You might also like
You kill me every time (You kill me every time)
You kill me every time (You kill me every time)

And you break me (You kill me every time)
And you take me (You kill me every time)
And you break me (You kill me every time)
And you take me (You kill me every time)
And you break me (Break me, break me)

And you break me (Break me, break me)
And you take me (Take me, take me)
And you break me (Break me, break me)
And you take me (Take me, take me)
And you break me (Break me, break me)
And you take me (Take me, take me)
And you break me (Break me)

You kill me every time
You kill me every time
You kill me every time
You kill me every time
And you take me (You kill me every time)
And you break me (You kill me every time)
And you take me (You kill me every time)
And you break me

You kill me every time (And you take me)
You kill me every time (And you break me)
You kill me every time (And you take me)
You kill me every time

(You kill me every time)Embed
