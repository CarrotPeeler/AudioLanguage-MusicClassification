3 ContributorsIn The Rim Lyrics
Strain of life begun
To live the day for you
Each moment became heavier
Than the last one
The wrong way accused
And not to blame for not being free
'Everyone is out to get you
Everyone except you'

Feeling
Control
Silence
Is only a dream now
Feeling
Control
Silence
Dream now

What have you not tried
Why haven't you tried
To see for yourself
Who dwells inside
You might also likeThere beyond excuses
There beneath the waves
And above burns the sun
Below, a burning one

Feeling
Control
Silence
Is only a dream now
Feeling
Control
Silence
Dream now

The greater the blame
If the fire is burning like
Ashes in the rain
The greater the blame
If the fire is burning like
Ashes in the rain
In the rain
All want to win
Here in the rim
All want to win
And all need to lose
Here in the rim
Here in the rim
All want to win
Here in the rim

The greater the blame
If the fire is burning like
Ashes in the rain
The greater the blame
If the fire is burning like
Ashes in the rainEmbed
