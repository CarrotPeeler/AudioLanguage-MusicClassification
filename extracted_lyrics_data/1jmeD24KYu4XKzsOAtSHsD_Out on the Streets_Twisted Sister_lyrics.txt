3 ContributorsOut On The Streets LyricsI walk alone
Through sleepless nights
I'm just another number
Somethin' just ain't right
Searchin' for something
In this human zoo
Kaleidoscope of faces
Maybe, maybe it might be you
I feel like I lost my way
Things get darker every day that I stay
You're out on the streets
Livin' on your own
You're out on the streets
So far from home
When you're out on the streets
You can't understand what's goin' on
You're out on the streets
Your heart's your only home
The mind it wanders
Through shattered dreams
Hours pass in seconds
And my heart it screams
I can't fight the past
I force back all of my tears
'Cause there ain't no turnin' back
Minutes, minutes turn to years
Someone listen to my prayers
Can't help feelin' no one cares, no one dares
You're out on the streets
Livin' on your own
You're out on the streets
So far from home
When you're out on the streets
You can't understand what's goin' on
You're out on the streets
Your heart's your only home
Maybe there's a place for me
Is my dreaming to be free, fantasy
You're out on the streets
Livin' on your own
You're out on the streets
So far from home
When you're out on the streets
You can't understand what's goin' on
You're out on the streets
Your heart's your only home
You're out on the streets
You're livin' on your own
You're out on the streets
So far, so far from home
When you're out on the streets
I can't understand what's goin' on
You're out on the streets
Your heart's your only homeYou might also likeEmbed
