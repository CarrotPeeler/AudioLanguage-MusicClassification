Some days, I'll be walking along
And you'll step on the scene where I'll be
Hopefully, you'll be touched by my charm
And the words of the song will lead the way
Bright eyes and thangs, dark hair, earrings
Just a few of the things I like about you

Sista Big Bone (Big Bones)
Can a brotha walk you home?
(Can I walk right beside you?)
Look like a plate of neckbones
(Look so good, look so good)
I'd like to keep your body warm (Uh-huh)

Frankly, I admire your style
How you go into work every day
Confidence in your walk, in your stride
Have my nose open wide, Miss Thang
I'd like to take you on a nice date
Shoot some riddles, have some vittles with you
Make no mistake, I'll be a gentleman
Take your coat, open doors, things I'll do
You might also like
Sista Big Bone (Big Bone, yeah)
Can a brotha walk you home?
(Can I walk right beside you?)
Look like a plate of neckbones
(Oh, you look so good, look so good)
I'd like to keep your body warm
(I'd like to keep your body warm)

I'd like to dance with you (Yeah)
Hold hands and walk with you (Oh)
Sing songs and stare at you
Miss Thang, Miss Thang, yeah

Sista Big Bone (Big Bone)
Can a brotha walk you home?
(Can I walk right beside you?)
Look like a plate of neckbones
(Oh, you look so good, look so good)
I'd like to keep your body warm
(I'd like to keep your body warm)
Sista Big Bone (Sista Big Bones, yeah)
Can a brotha walk you home?
(Can we take a long walk, baby?)
Look like a plate of neckbones
(Oh, you look so good, look so good)
I'd like to keep your body warm
(Said I'd like to, said I'd like to, baby)
Sista Big Bone (Sista Thickness, said I like ya)
Can a brotha walk you home?
(We can take the long way, baby)
Look like a plate of neckbones
(Oh, I wanna be right next to you)
I'd like to keep your body warm
(Keepin' you warm, baby, yeah)
Sista Big Bone
(Open your door, I'll take your coat)
Can a brotha walk you home?
(I'll listen to you, everything you do)
Look like a plate of neckbones
(How was your day?)
I'd like to keep your body warm
(Look so good to me, yeah)
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, oh, oh-oh
Sista Thickness, get down with you with the quickness
I hope you won't forget this
Put me on your gift list
I'll be around 'til Christmas, ohEmbed
