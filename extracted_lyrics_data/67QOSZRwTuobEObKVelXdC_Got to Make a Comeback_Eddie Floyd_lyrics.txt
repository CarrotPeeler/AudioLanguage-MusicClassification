3 ContributorsGot to Make a Comeback LyricsLoving you was always a cost
That I never bought till we started drifting apart
Now I know the love that you give
Is something that I’ve got to kiss
Got to make comeback
To your heart
I realize, the love light is lost
There’s no greater cross to bear
Than the pain of a broken heart
Now I know that I’ve got to pay, every night and day
Got to make comeback
To your heart
Now, girl, oh, when you say, baby
Here’s where it ends can’t we just be friends?
And I, oh, I have to make a new start
Oh, the love and that pain, trying to wind your love back again
Got to make comeback
To your heart
