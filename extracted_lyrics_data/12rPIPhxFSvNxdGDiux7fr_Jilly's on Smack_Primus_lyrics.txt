Jilly's on smack
And she won't be comin' back
No she won't be comin' back
For the holidays

Jilly's on smack
And she won't be comin' back
No she won't be comin' back
For the holidays

And Jilly left home
Went to pick her own bone
She made it on her own
In the market place

Jilly's on smack
And she won't be comin' back
No she won't be comin' back
For these holidays

Now Jilly's on smack
And she won't be comin' back
No she won't be comin' back
For the holidays
See Primus LiveGet tickets as low as $29You might also like
And Jilly had a smile
That spanned over a mile
She left him standing in the aisles
On the big parade

Jilly always phoned her mother
Emailed daily to her brother
Till she took a junkie lover
And began to fade

Now Jilly's on smack
And she won't be comin' back
No she won't be comin' back
For the holidays


*scatting*

Jilly's on smack
And she won't be comin' back
No she won't be comin' back (Jilly’s on smack)
For the holidays
Jilly's on smack
And she won't be comin' back
No she won't be comin' back (Jilly’s on smack)
For them holidaysEmbed
