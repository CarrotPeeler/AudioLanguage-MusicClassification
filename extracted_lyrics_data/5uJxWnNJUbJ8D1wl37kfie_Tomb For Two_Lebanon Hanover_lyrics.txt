3 ContributorsTomb For Two LyricsNo, the rain can’t stop our kisses
Nor does hailstorm or thunder
There’s room for you under my cover
A tomb for two morbid lovers
No, the rain can’t stop our kisses
Nor does hailstorm or thunder
There’s room for you under my cover
A tomb for two morbid lovers
No, the rain can’t stop our kisses
Nor does hailstorm or thunder
There’s room for you under my cover
A tomb for two morbid loversYou might also likeEmbed
