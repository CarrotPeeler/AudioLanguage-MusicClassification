Ye-ye-yeah, and it goes, that's my cool and I can't take it off
I-I-I'm far too cool, le-le-let's talk abo-bo-bout tha-that

You do something to me, feel it in the air
Ca-can't put my finger on, but it's right there, the-there
Next to the shades, next to the colors of my shoes
And the denims on my waist
Yeah, ki-kid ain't never seen it like this
No-not the way you look at me it's so electric
Co-co-could have been whatever but I made it fit
Now they're watching my moves, we in to play that shit
Nobody believed it til' I made some choruses
And I ain't never once pulled my pants up on me
Only thing I did was write beats, that's cool
Now everywhere I go people still wanna know
So I keep it on me like it's nothing
They say the kid from Tensta got something
I say I don't know what can that be
The-the-they say the cool is all over me-me-me

Ye-ye-yeah, and it goes, that's my cool and I can't take it off
I-I-I'm far too cool, le-le-let's talk abo-bo-bout tha-that
You might also like
They keep tellin' me it's in demand, work!
Did you really think I'd think about that? Not at all
A-a-always been this, never been a chaser
Only difference is a dude in the paper
Even saw myself on TV the other day
M-E to the T to the V you get me
Momma look happy in the video you did
Tha-that means more to me than this other shit-it
I can do without a car, cool with the subway
Milkshake game, man, stake that money
How you gonna say it, that this nigga don't shine?
Must not have listened to my words, he lyin'
Then what I said a couple lines back, huh
Di-di-did I say something that you gon' hate? Wha-wha-what?
I-I must have did that really
Am I that cool, man, you can't even feel me?

Ye-ye-yeah, and it goes, that's my cool and I can't take it off
I-I-I'm far too cool, le-le-let's talk abo-bo-bout tha-that

My-my-my-my cool, my cool-cool, my cool, my-my-my-my
So I keep it on me like it's nothin'
They say homie you better stop frontin'
I say I don't know, what can that be?
They say the cool is all over me
I-I don't know what it is, gotta be somethin'
They say homie you better stop frontin'
I say I donâ€™t know, what can that be
Th-th-they say the cool is all over me-me-me
Ye-ye-yeah, and it goes, that's my cool and I can't take it off
I-I-I'm far too cool, le-le-let's talk abo-bo-bout tha-that1Embed
