2 ContributorsGiants in the Ocean LyricsBoundless water in an eternity frame of mind
And all thats lost is our time
Peaks break through open sky that grasps for land below
Mountains climb and topple on themselves
Steel breaks wave and sounds lull us to sleep
All things drift quietly away...
Forget your cell phone man, it won't work here
Forget your cell phone man, it won't work here
It won't work here
It won't work here
It won't work here
My camera's zoom - it captures all that might embrace it
Unsteadied ice creates the wake in deeper places
Oh darling, I can't bare the thought of separation
The years will pass and we'll forget of how this made us
There is substance in this silence
The proof of what surrounds us
Photographs are a mirror image
Look deep and see yourself in them
Seasickness, ancient forests, and water creatures
Keep us from thinking about homeYou might also likeEmbed
