3 ContributorsDonâ€™t Leave Me But Leave Me Alone LyricsA respect overload
Blocks your way to get to know me well
But I won't hear what you say
From underneath my diamond shell
I don't know why I tell you
Do you believe me when I tell you
If you don't know the way
Why am I waiting for you here
We're so close in your mind
But separated by your fear
Have you got something against me
I've got nothing against you
I really wanna know you
You don't leave me, but leave me alone
I don't really need to be on my own
Reach for me - I cannot reach for you - no more
I don't see if you throw me a bone
I won't wait until the cowards come home
Reach for me - I really want you to
Aah that's a good girl
A respect overload
Is something I don't recommend
It might be easy to quit
But so damn hard not to start again
You might also likeAah that's a good girl
Oh such a good girl
Nobody told you
But I really wanted to
Out of the darkness
Into my emptinessEmbed
