Belief makes things real
Makes things feel, feel alright
Belief makes things true
Things like you, you and I

Tonight, you arrested my mind
When you came to my defense
With a knife in the shape of your mouth
In the form of your body, with the wrath of a God
Oh, you stood by me

Belief builds from scratch
Doesn't have to relax, it doesn't need space
Long live the queen, and I'll be the king
In the color of grace

Oh tonight, you arrested my mind
When you came to my defense
With a knife in the shape of your mouth
In the form of your body, with the wrath of a god
Oh, you stood by me, belief
You might also like
I'm gonna yell it from the rooftops
I'll wear a sign on my chest
That's the least I can do, it's the least I can do

Tonight, you arrested my mind
When you came to my defense
With a knife, in the shape of your mouth
In the form of your body, with the wrath of a God
Oh, you stood by me
Tonight, you arrested my mind
When you came to my defense
With a knife, in the shape of your mouth
In the form of your body, with the wrath of a God
Oh, you stood by me and I'll stand by my belief

I will stand by my
I will stand by my
Belief
Belief
Like you stood by me
I will stand by my, stand by my belief
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-ohEmbed
