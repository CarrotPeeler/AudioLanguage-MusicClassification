5 ContributorsComfort You Lyrics
I wanna comfort you
I wanna comfort you
I wanna comfort you
Just let your tears run wild
Like when you were a child
I'll do what I can do
I wanna comfort you
You put the weight on me
You put the weight on me
You put the weight on me


When it gets too much for me
When it gets too much, much too much for me
I'll do the same thing that you do
And I'll put the weight on you
Huh
I'll put the weight on you
I'll put the weight on you
And I'll do the same thing that you do
I'll put the weight on you

I wanna comfort you
I wanna comfort you
And I wanna comfort you
Just let your tears run wild
Like when you were a child
I'll do what I can do
I just wanna comfort you
