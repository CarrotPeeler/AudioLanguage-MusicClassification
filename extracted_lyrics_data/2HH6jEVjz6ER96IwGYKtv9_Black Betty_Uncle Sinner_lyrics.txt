Black Betty had a baby
And the damn thing's crazy
I said the damn thing's crazy
Oh she stuck his head in gravy
Squirrel head gravy
Oh Lord, Black Betty!
Oh Lord, Black Betty!
Well the baby had blue eyes
I said the baby had blue eyes
Well she worryin' outta mind
Damn thing gone blind
Oh Lord, Black Betty!
Oh Lord, Black Betty!
Black Betty's got a new man
Black Betty's got a new man
Ain't no flesh upon his cold hand
Ain't no flesh upon his cold hand
Black Betty where you goin'?
Black Betty where you goin'?
"Well I come from somewhere
And I'm goin' to nowhere."

Well it's a-thirty off thirty
It's a-thirty off thirty, bam-ba-lamEmbed
