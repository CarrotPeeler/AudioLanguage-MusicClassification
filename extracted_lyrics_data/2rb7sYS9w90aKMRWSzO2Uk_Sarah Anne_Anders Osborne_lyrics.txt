Tell me what you want me to do
Tell me what you want me to say
To make this day last forever
Oh Sarah Anne, Sarah Anne
Tell me what's on your mind
Tell me what steals the time
Away from us being together
Oh my love
Nothing's gonna ever change the way I feel
Oh my love
Nothing's going to ever change the way I need
You
Oh Sarah Anne, Sarah Anne
I wanna know all your dreams
Tell me, how does it feel
Oh, how does it feel
To be so sensual?
So Sarah Anne, Sarah Anne
I wanna make love again
I wanna feel the touch of your skin
Again and again
Again and again
Oh my love
Nothing's gonna ever change the way I feel
Oh my love
Nothing's going to ever change the way I need
You
Oh Sarah Anne, Sarah Anne
Tell me what you want me to do
Tell me what you want me to say
To make this day last forever
Oh Sarah Anne, Sarah Anne
Tell me what's on your mind
Tell me what takes the time
Away from us being together
Oh my love
Nothing's gonna ever change the way I feel
Oh my love
Nothing's going to ever change the way I need...You might also likeEmbed
