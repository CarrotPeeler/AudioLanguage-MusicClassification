My heart is black and my lips are cold
Cities on flame with rock and roll
Three thousand guitars, they seem to cry
My ears will melt and then my eyes

Let the girl, let that girl, rock and roll
Cities on flame now with rock and roll

Gardens of Nocturne, forbidden delight
Reins of steel and it's alright
Cities on flame with rock and roll
Marshall will buoy, but Fender control

So let the girl, let that girl, rock and roll
Cities on flame now with rock and roll


My heart is black and my lips are cold
Cities on flame with rock and roll
Three thousand guitars, they seem to cry
My ears will melt and then my eyes
You might also like
So let the girl, let that girl, rock and roll
Cities on flame now with rock and roll
