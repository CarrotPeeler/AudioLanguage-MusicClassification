11 ContributorsIn Trance Lyrics
I wake up in the morning
And the sun begins to shine
The day did sneak up on the night
I see your face and I see myself
And I get a little taste of life
I try to stand it for awhile

But I'm in a trance
Hey, baby, tell me, can't you hear me calling?
I'm in a trance
I take too much in the Saturday night
Hey
Hey, baby, tell me, can't you hear me calling?
I'm in a trance
I wanna try to stop this life

I feel so sad, I'm feeling down
On the radio, the music plays
I'm in love with her and I feel fine
I close my eyes
I think today it's getting better with a sip of wine
And I can stand it for awhile

When I'm in a trance
Hey, baby, tell me, can't you hear me calling?
I'm in a trance
I take too much in the Saturday night
Hey
Hey, baby, tell me, can't you hear me calling
I'm in a trance
I wanna try to stop this life


I'm in a trance
Hey, baby, tell me, can't you hear me calling?
I'm in a trance
I take too much in the Saturday night
Hey
Hey, baby, tell me, can't you hear me calling?
I'm in a trance
I wanna try to stop this life

Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah
