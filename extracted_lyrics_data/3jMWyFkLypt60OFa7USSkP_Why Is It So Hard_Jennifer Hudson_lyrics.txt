5 ContributorsWhy Is It So Hard Lyrics
Well I'm on the fence, I'm undecided
So very tense, still a little upset
But I don't wanna make an angry decision
And regret it later, so I haven't decided yet

But I could never ever feel like this
When the words "I love you" leave my lips
I mean it when I say I just hate how difficult you make it

Why is it so hard? So hard?
So hard to love you, so hard to stay, hey
Why is it so hard? So hard to love you
But this is the one time I don't care about the easy way, no, no

'Cause it makes sense irration to me
I'm still around though I can't believe one word that you say
No it don't make no sense, I'm always crying
But I'd cry oceans if you ever went away

But I could never ever feel like this
When the words "I love you" leave my lips
I mean it when I say I just hate how difficult you make it

Why is it so hard? So hard?
So hard to love you, so hard to stay, hey
Why is it so hard? So hard to love you
But this is the one time I don't care about the easy way, hey
Why is it so hard?

Oh, I can walk out that door (Walk that door)
And never come around anymore (Anymore)
But that would make no sense to me
But see, I love you baby, and through the thick and thin
This is where I'm supposed to be (Supposed to be)

Hey, why is it so hard? So hard?
So hard to love you, hey, so hard to stay
Why is it so hard? So hard to love you
But this is the one time I don't care about the easy way, no, no

Why is it so hard? So hard?
So hard to love you, so hard to stay, hey (Why is it so hard? Hey, yeah, yeah)
Why is it so hard? So hard to love you
But this is the one time I don't care about the easy way, hey
Why is it so hard?Embed
