Don't you know I gotta right to sing the blues?
Listen at this, look out!
One, two, yeah
I gotta right to sing the blues
I gotta right to feel lowdown
I gotta right to hang around
Down among the river
A certain gal in this old town
Keeps draggin' my poor heart around
Babe, all I see for me is misery
I gotta right to moan and sigh, moan and sigh
I gotta right to sit and cry
Down among the river
Oh babe, I know the deep blue sea
Will soon be callin' me
It must be love - say what you choose
