1 ContributorFall Apart Today LyricsI don't want us
To fall apart today or ever
You're the one who said
You'd never leave
There's no good reason for
Giving up
All this mess is just bad luck
So please don't lose your
Confidence in me
I wish I wasn't so fragile
Cause I know that I'm not
Easy to handle
Oh baby please
Don't forget you love me
Don't forget you love me
Today
Oh my baby please
Don't forget you love me
Don't forget you love me
Today
I don't wanna feel like this
But I'm so tired of missing you
I don't wanna beg for your time
I want you mine, all mine
You might also likeI wish I wasn't so fragile
Cause I know that I'm not
Easy to handle
Oh baby please
Don't forget you love me
Don't forget you love me
Today
Oh my baby please
Don't forget you love me
Don't forget you love me
Today
I bet you smile when you
Think of me
You love me
Messy in the morning
Freckles on my knees
Oh baby please
Oh baby please
Don't forget you love me
Don't forget you love me
Today
Oh my baby please
Don't forget you love me
Don't forget you love me
Today
Oh baby, sweet baby oh
Oh my baby, sweet baby
Don't forget you love me...Embed
