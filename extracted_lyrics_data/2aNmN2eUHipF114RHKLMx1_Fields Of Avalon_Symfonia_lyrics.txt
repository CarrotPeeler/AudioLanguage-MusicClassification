1 ContributorFields Of Avalon Lyrics
Sometimes I fell I've got nowhere to go
Life gets to me and I don't want to know
Far, far away, I'm here to stay
I won't be led to astray

I turn my back and walk away
'Cause I just have to find another way
Turning the page, leaving the cage
Having a new day to face

Fields of Avalon, call my name
Leading me without a shame, I've got no one to blame
And when things are getting tough, don't give up
Just follow me to Fields of Avalon
Just follow me

So now I left my past behind
So many things for me to find
Far, far away, I'm here to stay
Having a new day to face

Fields of Avalon, call my name
Leading me without a shame, I've got no one to blame
And when things are getting tough, don't give up
Just follow me to Fields Of Avalon
Just follow me

Fields of Avalon, call my name
Leading me without a shame, I've got no one to blame
And when things are getting tough, don't give up
Just follow me, yeah
To Fields of Avalon, call my name
Leading me without a shame, I've got no one to blame
And when things are getting tough, don't give up
Just follow me
