2 ContributorsSeven Days LyricsOh why we can't touch the sky?
There's no reason why
You hurt my heart
Oh why you will make me blue?
It's just me and you
And no one else
Please don't believe what they're telling about me
I love you, my babe, can't you see?
Seven days and seven lonely nights
I can' t hold baby by my side
Love me everything in my life
Seven days and seven lonely nights
Babe I love you to thе day I die
Where for your lovе since I seen you
Since I saw you baby
Oh try to give us one more chance
For a new romance closer than close
Don't cry Baby you're self-blind
You're all my mind for my whole life
Remember my words
Ever be away
I love you babe night and day

I can't hold by baby my side
Love me everything in my life
Seven days and seven lonely nights
Babe I love you to the day I die
Where for your love since I seen you
Seven days and seven lonely nights
Oh I'm waiting just to hope you tie
Like the sunshine in the wintertime
Uh…oh… I miss you…
Seven days and seven lonely nights
I can't hold Baby by my side
Love you…
In my life…
Lonely nights…
Heyaha…
Since I seen you…
Since I seen you…Embed
