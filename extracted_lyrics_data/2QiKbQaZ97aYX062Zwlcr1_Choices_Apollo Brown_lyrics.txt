Let your heart be light
From now on our troubles will be out of sight
Have yourself a Merry Little Christmas
Make the yuletide gay
From now on our troubles will be miles away
Here we are as in olden days
Happy golden days of yore
Faithful friends that are dear to us
Gather near to us once more
Through the years we all
Will be together if the faiths allow
Hang a shining star upon the highest bough
And have yourself a Merry Little Christmas night
Through the years
We all will be together if the faiths allow
Hang a shining star upon the highest bough
And have yourself a Merry Little Christmas night
And have yourself a Merry Little Christmas nightYou might also like1Embed
