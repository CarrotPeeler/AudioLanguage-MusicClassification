4 ContributorsCabo Wabo LyricsI've been to Rome, Dallas, Texas
Man, I thought I'd seen it all
Around the world, searchin' every corner
Man, I thought I'd hit the wall, ah
There's a sleepy town lies south of the border
If you go there once, you'll be there twice
Lots of pretty girls coming by the dozens, whoo
The white sand sure makes a tan look nice
We can crash on the beach
You know I wanna make love in the sea
We gotta try a little dance, so Cabo Wabo
It's all right by me
Come on, let me take you down
I will show you all around (Down in Cabo)
Let me take you down
Face down in Cabo
Kissing the ground
Land's end, you'd have to see it
Ain't no picture ever say it right, no
Walkin' the streets doing that ole, Cabo Wabo, ha
Place come to life every night, no
You might also likeI wanna crash on the beach
You know I wanna make love in the sea
Yeah, it's all right there
We don't have to chase it
Fits paradise to a T, whoo
Come on, let me take you down
I will show you all around (Down in Cabo)
Let me take you down
Face down in Cabo
Kissing the ground, whoo

Uh huh, whoa
Whoa, hey
Whoa
We drink mescal right from the bottle
Salt shake, a little lick a-lime, ah
Throwin' down, down, tryin' to reach the bottom
Where the guave worm, well, he's mine all mine
Come on, crash on the beach
You know I wanna make love in the sea, whoo
Go and try a little dance, so Cabo Wabo
It's all right by me
Let me take you down
I will show you all around (Down in Cabo)
Let me take you down
Face down in Cabo
Kissing the ground, whoo uh
Face down (Face down)
Down in Cabo
Take me down (Take me down)
Down to Cabo
Ooh, face down (Face down)
Down in Cabo, doin' the Cabo Wabo, ow
Take me down (Take me down)
Down to Cabo, whoo
Come on, get it, get it, ow
Aha, whoo, ow, come onEmbed
