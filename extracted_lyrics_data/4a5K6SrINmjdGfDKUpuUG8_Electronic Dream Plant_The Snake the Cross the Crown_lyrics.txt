1 ContributorElectronic Dream Plant LyricsShe said the city's not for sleeping
And the nighttime is for me
And cause my body is forsaken
In the end I'll come home for I am he
Sweet Virginia's left for higher ground
The test of the bow
Weeping window revival
A dream plant, it may grow
If we choose not to let it go
She said there's more to life than thinking
And that these feet will carry me
From the hills down to the hollow
In the end I'll come home for I am free
Sweet Virginia's left for higher ground
I don't want to go without you
So, I just wanna go with peace of mind
Save your sorrow
Save your sorrow
Old eyes
Can make a mother cryYou might also likeEmbed
