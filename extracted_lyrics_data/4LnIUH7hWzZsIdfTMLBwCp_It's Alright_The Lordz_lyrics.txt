1 ContributorItâ€™s alright Lyrics
I can't take it no more, I'm ready to move
My head is getting to big, I'm blowing a fuse
And I'm not ready to talk, I'm not in the mood
Stay away from me now, or you gon get blewed
It be yo own family, I find that clueless
I only talk to myself cuz I'm the realist
And I only take my pain cuz I can feel it
And I always thank the lord cuz he got me healing
You tell me how you want me to live, man that's outrageous
I gotta stay away from the hate, because it's contagious
And I'm going to continue to be unhappy until I make it
My mind is a mystery, so I gotta solve it
Could I find the best of me? I can't blend in
Because I'm not going to know myself
I got hit in the rear end
Could've really cost my health
All the time that I spent, it could've been with myself

I know your alone, and it's alright
I'm alone with you, and it's alright
And it's alright
Got the Lord with you, it's alright
You got your heart with you, it's alright
Uhhh baby, it's alright

I could've bought the coupe but I bought the Bentley
She could've been my girl but she to friendly
The wrist kinda froze I can't really hand it
And she in love with the rose I can't really explain it
Berry fusion Dutch, came with the space runts
Are you tryna go to mars?
And don't come back like no tomorrow?
It's alright
When I get to the court, I pass the ball
Man fuck the police ion believe in law
And I gotta leave my boys if my girl call
Uhhhhhh, eee
I'm gonna own a black house on elm street
I can't get rid of my dawgs, they better than me
And if you do get lost, you better find me
Cuz I believe in me, I believe in me

I'm alright
My heart is broken but I'm alright
I'm not at my best, but I'm alright
I'm not feeling myself, but I'm alright
Imma keep on pushing, cuz I'm alright
Imma keep on living, cuz I'm alright
Imma stay in the stu, cuz I'm alright
Imma try my best, and I'm alrightEmbed
