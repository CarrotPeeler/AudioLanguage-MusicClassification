8 ContributorsWhen It Rains, It Really Pours Lyrics
You know what it takes, you got it, baby
You are the only one I chose
Don't leave me here with all these heartaches
And you're the only one to know

About my troubles, troubles, troubles
When it rains, it really pours

You shouldn't have took away my love, dear
You know you thrill me from head to toe
I got a feeling for you baby
And you're the only one to know

About my troubles, troubles, troubles
When it rains, it really pours


You know what you did to make me love you
You really opened up my nose
You got what you wanted, now you left me
That's the way the story goes
You might also like
Well, I got troubles, troubles, troubles
When it rains, it really poursEmbed
