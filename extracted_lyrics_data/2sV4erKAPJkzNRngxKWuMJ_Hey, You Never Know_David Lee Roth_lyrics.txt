I caught a cold, I barely made it home
You say you love me only I felt no pain
And then I crashed my rent-a-car in the pouring rain
Seen it on a billboard
And I believe it's so
It said, "The only thing you know for certain
Is 'Hey, you never know'."
Aww, you just never know
Aww, no matter now
My friend Jerry's feet are achin', says he's hittin' bottom
Says it's a sex problem, he told me so
I told him "Jerry ain't the lovin' that you're makin', buddy
It's stayin' up all night and lookin' for it makes you slow."
Want some advice
And it's free for a reason you know
They say you only live twice
I say, "Hey, you never know."
And the hula girls go
(Ahh) You never
(Ahh) You never, never
(Ahh) You never know
(Ahh) You never
(Ahh) I say you never, never
(Ahh) You never know
You might also likeI make suggestions honey, you make the choices
Your Kodak moment's comin', I'll keep the motor runnin'
I stand corrected baby, I'm hearin' voices, honey
You got my engines hummin' and now I'm really runnin'
Right up your driveway sayin' hide in your hole
I'm on cruise control
And if they're sayin' that we're crazy
Well, hey, you never know
There go them hula girls again
(Ahh) You never
(Ahh) You never, never
(Ahh) You never know
(Ahh) You never
(Ahh) I say you never, never
(Ahh) You never know
You never know
You never, never
You never knowEmbed
