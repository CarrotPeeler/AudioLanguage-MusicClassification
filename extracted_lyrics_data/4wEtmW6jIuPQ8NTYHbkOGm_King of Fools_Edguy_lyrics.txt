8 ContributorsKing of Fools LyricsWhat do you think
When you spit in my face
How does if feel
To accuse and to haze
Now look at me
I'm not one of your kind
And I prefer to stay behind
And walk the wicked way

We don't wanna be like you
Don't you get that, king of fools
We don't mind your life is trite
You are the king of fools
We're never gonna be like you
We don't follow - king of fools
You're the blind to lead the blind
And I walk the wicked way
You feel at ease
As you flock with the masses
What do you see
With your heads in their asses
You might also likeKeep on railing at what I believe (I believe)
Call me insane and I am proud to be
And walk the wicked way

We don't wanna be like you
Don't you get that, king of fools
We don't mind your life is trite
You are the king of fools
We're never gonna be like you
We don't follow - king of fools
You are the blind to lead the blind - oh
We don't wanna be like you
Don't you get that, king of fools
We don't mind your life is trite
You are the king of fools
We're never gonna be like you
We don't follow - king of fools
You're the blind to lead the blind
Blind to lead the blind
We don't wanna be like you
Don't you get that, king of fools
We don't mind your life is trite
We don't mind your life is trite
We're never gonna be like you
We don't follow - king of fools
You're the blind to lead the blind
You are the king of foolsEmbed
