1 ContributorWreck My Car LyricsI just had to let you know
What you're doin' to me baby
Your love's a lot like gravy
Yes it is
I just can't get enough of your sweet stuff
You're my one and only
If you leave you leave me lonely
Well you try to break my heart
Rather you just go out and wreck my car
I got my mind set on you
I try to love you but you're just not true
Sweet dame you're always on my mind
I try to love you said all the time
You might also likeOnly you
Woah-oh
Can make me crazy like you do
Yeah ah you try to break my heart
Rather you just go out and wreck my car
You see the harder I try
The more I just wanna lay down and die
Yeah yeah
You drive me crazy
Get over here baby and save me
You're my one and only
If you leave you leave me lonely
Yeah ah you're tryin' to break my heart
Rather you just go out and wreck my car
I got my mind set on you
I try to love ya but you're just not true
Sweet baby you're always on my mind
I try to love you said all the time
Only you
Woah oh
Can make me crazy like you do
Yeah ah you try to break my heart
Rather you just go out and wreck my car
And I said hey hey baby
I wanna know
If you'll be my girlEmbed
