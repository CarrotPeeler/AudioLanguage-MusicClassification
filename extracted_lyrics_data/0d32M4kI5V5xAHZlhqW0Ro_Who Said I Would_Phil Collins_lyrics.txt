10 ContributorsWho Said I Would Lyrics
I know she says she wants me
I hear it every day
And I know she knows it keeps me
Well there ain't no other way

But she's got a heart
Must be made of stone
Because when I tell her
That she'll miss me when I'm gone, she says

"Who said I would"

She knows it ain't easy
For a simple boy like me
She fills me full of loving
But then she sets me free

But she's got a heart
Must be made of stone
Because when I tell her
That she'll miss me when I'm gone, she says
You might also like
"Who said I would
Tell me, who said I would
Who said I would (Who said I would)
Who said I would"

I'm not the only one, but I do fine
I suit her purpose and I'm just her kind
I don't own her and I never could
Don't think I do, don't think I should

"Tell me, who said I would
Who said I would"


But she's got a heart
Must be made of stone
Because when I tell her
That she'll miss me when I'm gone, she says

You're not the only one, but you'll do fine
You suit my purpose and you're just my kind
You don't own me and you never could
Don't think you do, don't think you should
"Who said I would (Who said I would)"

Now she knows when she calls me
I'll come running every time
And she knows she gets me hot
But she don't know it's her body, not her mind

And she's got a heart
Must be made of stone
Because when I tell her
That she'll miss me when I'm gone, she says

"Who said I would
Tell me, who said I would
Who said I would
Who said I would
Who said I would
Who said I would
(Who said I would)
(Who said I would)"1Embed
