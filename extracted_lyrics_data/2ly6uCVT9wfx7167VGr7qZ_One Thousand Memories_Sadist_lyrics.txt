2 ContributorsOne Thousand Memories LyricsI lived my full life like a rainy river
I kissed the ground and all its brothers
I drank salt water, ate fishes and sand
Today I'm a sailor of many seas
Tomorrow a naked priest
My legs are friends that shared
One thousand journeys to Hell
My knees remember the way
One thousand journeys to Hell
I kissed unloved women and paid their naked bodies
I spat anger without a reason
And rested in an unlocked room
Come inside my friend just stop and have a rest
Here I am, the man of the earth
I saw everything I could
Dark water runs and drags one thousand memories
Dark water runs and drags one thousand memories of mine
I cried as a real man does
I whispered feelings at a low voice
By myself in front of the fire
A quiet life, free as the flight
Of a bird which gives me its welcome
'till my beard turns white
I'm still thinking of you

Dark water runs and drags one thousand memories of mineEmbed
