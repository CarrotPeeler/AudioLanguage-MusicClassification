4 ContributorsA Real Hero LyricsReal human being ( being being being... )
And a real hero ( hero hero hero... )
Back against the wall and odds
With the strengh of a will and a cause
Your pursuits are called outstanding
You're emotionally complex
Against the grain
Of dystopic claims
Not the thoughts your actions entertain
And you, have proved, to be
A real human being, and a real hero
Real human being, and a real hero
Real human being, and a real hero
Real human being, and a real hero
Real human being ( being being being... )
A pilot on a cold, cold morn'
One hundred fifty five people on board
All safe and all rescued
From the slowly sinking ship
Water warmer than
His head so cool
In that tight bind knewï»¿ what to do'
And you, have proved, to be
A real human being, and a real hero
Real human being, and a real hero
Real human being, and a real hero
Real human being
Real human being ( being being being... )
