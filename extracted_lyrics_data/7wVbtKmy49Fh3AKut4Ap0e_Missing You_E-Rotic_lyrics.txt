Baby, I'm missing you
Aaah-aaah-ah-ha
Missing you
Aaaahh-aaah-aaah-ah-ha

So many nights of loneliness
Just dreaming of every sweet caress
I miss you
And I still long to be with you - Hey!
The ocean of time keeps flowing on
Roses of love are dead and gone
Without you
My heart is crying without you

Oh baby, I'm missing you
Miss the light in your eyes when I found you
Can't you see I'm still missing you?
Miss the magic of love that's around you
That was breaking my heart in two

I miss you
Oh baby, I'm missing you
Aaah-aaah-ah-ha
You might also like
So many nights of jealousy
Asking myself: where can you be?
I need you
Baby, I know how to treat you
I wonder if you, too, feel the same
And crying for love can't be a shame
I love you
You can believe me - I love you

Oh baby, I'm missing you
Miss the light in your eyes when I found you
Can't you see I'm still missing you?
Miss the magic of love that's around you
That was breaking my heart in two

I miss you
Oh baby, I'm missing you
Aaah-aaah-ah-ha

I'm missing you
Oh baby, I'm missing you
Oooh-oooh-ooh-hoo
Haaaah-haah-aaah-ah-ha

Baby, I'm missing you
Miss the light in your eyes when I found you
Can't you see I'm still missing you?
Miss the magic of love that's around you
That was breaking my heart in two

I miss you
Oh baby, I'm missing you
Aaah-aaah-ah-ha

I'm missing youEmbed
