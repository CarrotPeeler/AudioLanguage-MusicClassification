2 ContributorsOnion Skin LyricsHey, keep it in
Cut it out, kick it out
Keep it in
Cut it out, kick it out
Oh, oh, onion skin
Walking around with
Your heart caved in
When you start to roll
Your skin flies off
And the teardrops flow
Oh, oh, onion skin
You might see the trap
But you still fall in
When things start to roll
Your skin flies off
And the teardrops flow
These here are crazy times
Try keeping heart in mind
From rolling off
The chopping board
Keep your chin up
And choke back the tears
You might also likeThis here will make you cry
I'm being skinned alive
But I got layers to burn
You'll never get to
My heart at all
Oh, oh, onion skin
You might see the trap
But you still fall in
When things start to roll
Your skin flies off
And the teardrops flow
Onion skin
Keep it in
Cut it out, kick it out
Here it comes
Keep it in
Cut it out, kick it out
Oh, oh, onion skin
Walking around with
Your heart caved in
Said when you start to roll
Your skin flies off
And the teardrops flow
Oh, oh, onion skin
You might see the trap
But you still fall in
When things start to roll
Your skin flies off
And the teardrops flow
Your skin flies off
And the teardrops flow
Your skin flies off
And the teardrops flow
Your skin flies off
And the teardrops flow
Your skin flies off
And the teardrops flow
Keep it in
Cut it out, kick it out
Onion skin
Keep it in
Cut it out, kick it out
Onion skin
Keep it in
Cut it out, kick it out
Onion skin
Keep it in
Cut it out, kick it out
These here are crazy times
Never get to my heart at allEmbed
