5 ContributorsKilling Ground Lyrics
Follow the piper, follow the drum
Follow the footsteps our comrades begun
'Til the battle's won, battle's won
Follow the sabre, follow the gun
For king and for country we stand here as one
'Til the battle's done, battle's done

We are brothers in arms, we fight for the cause
Together we stand, divided we fall
On the killing ground
Killing ground

Cannons are roaring from left and to right
Into the carnage before us we fight
'Til the day is won, day is won
Thousands have fallen, around us they lie
Onwards together we fight or we die
'Til the day is done, day is done

We are brothers in arms, we march for the cause
Together we stand, divided we fall
On the killing ground
Killing ground

Charge into battle, victory we cry
Onto the lances, our sabres held high
Hear our battle cry, battle cry
The field is now silent, the conflict is done
Marching to glory through rivers of blood
To our battle cry, battle cry

We are brothers in arms, we die for the cause
Together we stand, divided we fall
We are brothers in arms, we die for the cause
Together we stand, divided we fall
On the killing ground, yeah


We are brothers in arms, we fight for the cause
Together we stand, divided we fall
We are brothers in arms, we die for the cause
Together we stand, divided we fall
We are brothers in arms
We march or we die
Together we stand
Divided we fallEmbed
