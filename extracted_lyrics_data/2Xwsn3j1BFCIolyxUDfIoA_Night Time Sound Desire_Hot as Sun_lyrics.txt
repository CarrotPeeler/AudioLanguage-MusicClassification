Yeah, it's Lewn and KidCrusher up in this motherfucker, yeah

Sit your ass back and meet the cannibal (cannibal)
Shut your ass up and meet the cannibal (cannibal)
Sit your ass back and meet the cannibal (cannibal)
Cannibal, cannibal

I'm underground, like a crab boy born and raised
Stealthed out like a sharpshooter, waitin' for my shot
And when I hear a sound, I'll be huntin' you down
I'll be bringin' you down, and I'll be keepin' you down
I got my victims tied up, torn to taste
And when I'm rapin' my victims, I got my camera in their face
And every bitch was a project
And the fuckin' makin' of their pointless lives that I planned on takin'
I was shoved down my mind, I kept fuckin' them from behind
And to clean up my dick, I made the bitches fuckin' lickin'
I was so fuckin' sick I'd even fuck a rigamortis
And the door was kept locked, and the sauna so red hot
So I can eat while fuckin', fuck cleanin' the blood
I straight cook it in a soup and the bitches with the lube
Bitch, I'll beat you to the side, just hangin' from the roof like a skylight
It was dark night, I don't even know what the fuck is goin' on
I don't even know why the fuck I'm doin' this
Oh motherfucker, listen to this
What I dribble is blood, guts, brains
Tickle, tingle the pain
And yo, it's Lewn and KidCrusher spittin' flesh when we die
Fuck a bitch for a dime, fuck a brown, then you die
And I mentally think sick shit, that wraps up my mind
And I kidnap and torture the closest cunt that I could find
You might also like
I'm fallin' apart and I'm losin' my mind
And I'm lookin' for pieces I can't seem to find
So I pick up a victim, and take out my knife
And I show them the dark side of pressure and pain
Show God that this world is nothin' but useless
The people are fuckheads and so full of hate
Who trust you, they fuck you, and suck up your life
They're fuckheads who fucked me, and fucked up my mind

Sit your ass back and meet the cannibal (cannibal)
Shut your ass up and meet the cannibal (cannibal)
Sit your ass back and meet the cannibal (cannibal)
Cannibal, cannibal
Sit your ass back and meet the cannibal (cannibal)
Shut your ass up and meet the cannibal (cannibal)
Sit your ass back and meet the cannibal (cannibal)
Cannibal, cannibal

I walk through the graveyard callin' out names
Lost in the cemetery maze full of graves
I move with the moonlight as my sun
Black eyes as the moons rise one by one
Here they come, the dead, the moon turns red
They're crawlin' from their beds, fresh wounds to their heads
We're livin' more now than we give it in alive
Look into our eyes and realize we're tied to the other side
Electrified, mind high, hypnotized, suicide
Time to die, open wide, flesh of mine, petrified
Night time, when the moon sits high
Atop of a bloody fresh tomb sits I
Behind black eyes, my dead mind
Cries for the flesh skin pins inside
Behind black eyes, my dead mind
Cries for the flesh skin pins inside
I'm a cannibal
I'm fallin' apart and I'm losin' my mind
And I'm lookin' for pieces I can't seem to find
So I pick up a victim, and take out my knife
And I show them the dark side of pressure and pain
Show God that this world is nothin' but useless
The people are fuckheads and so full of hate
Who trust you, they fuck you, and suck up your life
They're fuckheads who fucked me, and fucked up my mind

"Imagine such a perfect understanding
Being with someone who sees you as you really are
Who reflects your image back to you as something beautiful and pure
The closer I got, the harder it became to turn back
Was he so afraid to be alone?
Was it his need to feel whole that drove him?
Or was it just his desire for flesh
To devour something dear
Something that only he would know."Embed
