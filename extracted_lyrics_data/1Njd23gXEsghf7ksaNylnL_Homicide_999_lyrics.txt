I rest my case
Don't cast aside
You'd better believe it
That's the truth of it
Take it or leave it
Resign to it
Homicide

No one cares when someone lies
They'd rather say that it's a red alert
You'd better believe it
That's the truth of it
Take it or leave it
Resign to it

And letting loose this homicide all over town
I'll take your number
I'll take it down
What's your address?
I'll write it down
I'll be in touch, so don't leave town
In a big black car
