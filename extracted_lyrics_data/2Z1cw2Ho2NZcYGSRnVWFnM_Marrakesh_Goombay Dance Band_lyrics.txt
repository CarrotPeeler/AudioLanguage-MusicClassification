3 ContributorsMarrakesh LyricsMarrakesh, come to Marrakesh
To the city of gold near the sky
Marrakesh, come to Marrakesh
Where the troubles of life drift on by
Marrakesh, come to Marrakesh
Sings the rain when I can't sleep at night
Marrakesh, come to Marrakesh
Cries the wind calling me to Marrakesh
Where is my home, where is my land? (way down in Africa)
Where is my love, where are my friends? (way down in Africa)
Couldn't make a living there, had to find a job somewhere
Changed my name, took a plane and went away -
Marrakesh, come to Marrakesh
Says my heart when I feel all alone
Marrakesh, come to Marrakesh
You will find peace of mind in Marrakesh
People put me down - treat me like a clown I take it
(Marrakesh, come to Marrakesh)
Savin ev'ry dime, knowing I'll be fine some day
Marrakesh, come to Marrakesh
Cries the wind calling me to Marrakesh
Marrakesh, come to Marrakesh
To the city of gold near the sky
Marrakesh, come to Marrakesh
Where the troubles of life all the hustle and strife will go by
Marrakesh, come to Marrakesh!
Yells the train rollin' by in the dark
Marrakesh, come to Marrakesh!
I'll be free, I'll be me in Marrakesh
People put me down - treat me like a clown I take it
(Marrakesh, come to Marrakesh!)
Saving ev'ry dime, knowing I'll be fine some day
You might also likeMarrakesh, come to Marrakesh
You will find peace of mind in Marrakesh
Marrakesh, come to Marrakesh!
I'II be free, I'll be me in MarrakeschEmbed
