Once the feeling comes
You play the part, break the heart
Until you feel alive
Scratch through the ceiling you love
To have your fun behind the gun
Until the fever dies
And...

There's something at work here 
Dark circles around your body

Soon you'll be stealing from the odds and ends
Who once were friends, now you demonize
Back to the meaning of the way you are
You crash the car to make the fever rise
And...


Shiftless inside your guise
Well lay the card that bears upon
What used to be a lie
Slips your aching heart
'Til once again, without, within
We'll come to be invitedYou might also likeEmbed
