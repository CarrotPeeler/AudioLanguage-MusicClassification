2 ContributorsGod Who Saves LyricsVerse 1
The light of the world
Shining in love
Taking the fall upon Your shoulders
You shattered the dark
As You rose to life again
Verse 2
You search all the earth
For those who are lost
And leaving the rescued for the fallen
You're leading us home
As we call upon Your Name
Chorus
You're the God who saves
You're the hope of all
Reaching out Your hand
As Your people call
Verse 3
Our Saviour has come
Let Your will be done
Your kingdom on earth as in the heavens
Our freedom is found
Lord in no other Name
You might also likeVerse 4
You are the Way
The Truth and the Life
Your mercy has overcome our failings
The battle is won
Jesus in love You reign
(Interlude)
Oh oh
Oh oh
(Bridge)
Here in Your light ever brighter
We lift Your Name higher and higherEmbed
