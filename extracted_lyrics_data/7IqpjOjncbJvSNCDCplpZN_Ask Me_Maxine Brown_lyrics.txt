1 ContributorBetter Places LyricsIt's a perfect day to get to high
Watch the smoke rise, watch it fly
I move the hair from your face
And you smile
I love you longtime
Will you love me for a while?
It's only you
You
You
It's only you
You
You
Oh, it's only
I know that
You've got
Better places
To be than
Right here
Beside me
But I love you
And I need you to know that

Meant to be
Since day 1
Like crazy
My darling
I mean it
My darling
We've got it for real
In the garden
You set my soul on fire
Touch my hand and ask me
Arе you mine?
Brown eyes and goldеn spires
I love you longtime
Will you love me for a while?
It's only you
You
You
It's only you
You
You
Oh, it's only
I know that
You've got
Better places
To be than
Right here
Beside me
But I love you
And I need you to know that
We were
Meant to be
Since day 1
Like crazy
My darling

My darling
