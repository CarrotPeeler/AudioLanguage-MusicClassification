We go on
We go on
We just let the beat take us away until the early morn'

I feel the music deep in my body and I can't help it
I just loose it, even when everybody is watching
I just break it down, break it down, break it down
Break it down, break it down, break it down
So tell the DJ this is my song
So keep it going on the replay all night long
So we can show them how to work it out, work it out, work it out
Work it out, work it out, work it out, work it out

We go on
We go on
We just let the beat take us away until the early morn'
We go on
We go on
We just let the beat take us away until the early morn'

So every weekend, me and my girls pay at the club
We don't be speakin', we just be out there on the floor
That's when we break it down, break it down, break it down
Break it down, break it down, break it down, break it down
See we be showin' how poppin' and lockin'
Them moves that they don't even know about
Wait for the needle to drop, that's when we work it out, work it out, work it out
Work it out, work it out, work it out, work it out
You might also like
We go on
We go on
We just let the beat take us away until the early morn'
We go on
We go on
We just let the beat take us away until the early morn'

We go on
We go on (Ooh, mm, yeah)
We just let the beat take us away until the early morn'
We go on
We go on
We just let the beat take us away until the early morn'Embed
