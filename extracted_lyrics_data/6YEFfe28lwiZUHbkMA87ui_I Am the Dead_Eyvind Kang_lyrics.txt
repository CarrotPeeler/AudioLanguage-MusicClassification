4 ContributorsI Am the Dead LyricsI am the dead of all dead
The passages of the dead
That have brought you here
Love is the tunnel, thin, rabid, pearly
Has brought you to me by molecules
A force known as gravity leans down from planets
Modulations﻿ of your heart
Thickness of your blood
Lovers, can you hear the anguish of your used planet?You might also likeEmbed
