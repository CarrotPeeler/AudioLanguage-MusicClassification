6 ContributorsFuck Machine Lyrics
It's something physical, conditioned reaction
And it's something physical, conditioned attraction
But have I finally escaped?
Will my eyes no longer rape the innocent?
Women, children, human beings
Seeing the pain that it brings
Shallow, superficial decision
Real beauty obscured by my television

But this just in, bikini film at ten
The female anchor just smiles and shrugs it off
Boys will be boys
Do you really wanna be our fucking toys?

And yet again, condone it with a grin
Just sit back, idly chat, smile
Prove you're just a fuck machine
Is that what you really wanna fucking be?

Conditioned reaction
Conditioned attraction
Conditioned suggestion
Conditioned rejection
You might also like
And yet again
Subjecting women
The female anchor's fists finally clenched
I'm not your fucking toy!

And though I long to embrace
I will not misplace priorities
Humour, opinion, a sense of compassion
Creativity and a distaste for fashionEmbed
