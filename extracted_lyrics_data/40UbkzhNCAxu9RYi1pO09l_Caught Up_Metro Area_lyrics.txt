1 ContributorNew Acropolis Lyrics
Your tryna buy a lot will leave you short changed
He with no pride can only afford shame
Some bang doors to spread the lords name
Broadsheets force their views and false claims
Bombs being used as dice in war games
Protest songs are sung for more gains
Freedom comes with 12 or more chains
Leaders will sell their souls for short reigns
Truth run amok with my mind I maintain
Some find solace in art and spray trains
Some write bars in depth of great plains
Peace to the people who rep to make change
He without love can only afford pain
Life don't lead itself it's your game
To be without a strength of heart it's not sane
He without sense repents and gets flames

The metro metropolis
Caught up in a modern day acropolis
Raised in the cradles of apocalypse
Everything I see is thought provocative
Tryna sober up a bit
Feeling like I'm clinging to a rocket ship
Then I crash landed with my pockets dipped
Head full of politics
Haunted in the mirrors of the opposites
Life's like a horrorcade
And every day is like another game
All I gotta do is stay on top of it
They tell you that it's raining
When they're pissing in your pocket kid
So why you living how they told us the apostles did
They tie a ribbon to reality and floss with it
Ever since the days when the prehistoric fossil lived
And where'd you think we get the drugs that we hustle with
They're telling us it's raining
But they're pissing in your pocket kid
They keep on doing all the things they tell us god forbids
We used to hunt, but now we need a job to live
And some have sold drugs and some of us will rob to live
Trapped in acropolis metro metropolis
I'm from the bottom man I've never seen the top of this
Societies a baby in the cradle of apocalypse
Lost in the colony, metro anomalies
Real world monopolies, swarm like halophiles
They're telling us it's raining
When they're poisoning our forestry
Chips in your passport, electric is on a key
Money and your gas is on a card
If you want a spree
Take a li'l out the ATM and most'll want a fee
Then you get some paper represented by the monarchy
There's promise in the barer to the value of their policies
And if you was a yout' do ya know who you would wanna be?
I'm living on the bottom end of typical economy
I'm pickled in a bottle tryna tickle all my properties
But then I think about the truth I'm happy for the pot to pee
And clean running water, and other things we got for free
All the open opportunities I know I've got to see
Hunger's still hunger man, everybody's got to feed
No matter what your circumstance, even if you got to thief
It's just the same that's here and everybody got to breathe
Or me I gotta show 'em all the fight before I got to leave
'Cause I'll be living out the balance of the prophecies
Challenging the man in the box for his hypocrisies
You might also like
Tryna buy a lot will leave you short changed
He with no pride can only afford shame
Some bang doors to spread the lords name
Broadsheets force their views and false claims
Bombs being used as dice in war games
Protest songs are sung for more gains
Freedom comes with 12 or more chains
Leaders will sell their souls for short reigns
Truth run amok with my mind I maintain
Some find solace in art and spray trains
Some write bars in depth of great plains
Peace to the people who rep to make change
He without love can only afford pain
Life don't lead itself it's your game
To be without a strength of heart it's not sane
He without sense repents and gets flamesEmbed
