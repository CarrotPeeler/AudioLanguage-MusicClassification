1 ContributorLate In The Evening Blues Lyrics
It was late in the evening
And the sun was going down
I would pray to the good Lord
To please bring my baby round
Yes, I miss her more than even
To me she's the only one
I miss her more than ever
To me she's the only one
She'd be the on that
When I need a favor done

I hate to hear the raindrops beat
Against my window pane

I'm so blue without my baby
It's enough to drive old me insane
Will I ever find my baby
She's the one I can't afford to lose
Will I ever find my baby
She's the one I can't afford to lose
I wake up early in the morning
