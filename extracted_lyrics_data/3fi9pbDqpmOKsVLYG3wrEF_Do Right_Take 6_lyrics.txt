1 ContributorDo Right LyricsI know that He gave His life for me
Set all our spirits free
So I wanna do right, wanna do right
All of my life
And I never dreamed that I could be holding you
Well, He's making my dreams come true
So I wanna do right, wanna do right
I wanna do right
Oh, you got to do right
Yes, you gotta do right
Let Him be your guiding light
(You got to do right)
Yes, you gotta do right
Let Him be your guiding light
Listen to me people
I used to say love was just a game we played
Now I see it in a different way
So I wanna do right
I gotta do right
And I never knew that I could be holding you
Well, He's making my dreams come true
So I wanna do right, wanna do right
I wanna do right
Oh, you got to do right
Yes, you gotta do right
Let Him be your guiding light
(You got to do right)
Yes, you gotta do right
Let Him be your guiding light
Listen to me people
Well, we just can't keep on livin' like we're livin'
We just can't keep on
(Livin' like we're livin')
Just can't keep on pushin' to the limit
We just can't keep on
(Can't keep on)
Just can't keep on livin' like we're livin'
We just can't keep on
(Livin' like we're livin')
Just can't keep on pushin' to the limit
We just can't keep on
(Can't keep on)
Just can't keep on livin' like we're livin'
No, we just can't
Just can't keep on livin' like we're livin'
We just can't keep on
Just can't keep on pushin' to the limit
We just can't keep on
Don't you know we gotta do right
Oh, don't you know
And He'll be your guiding light
Be your guiding light
Be your guiding lightSee Take 6 LiveGet tickets as low as $33You might also likeEmbed
