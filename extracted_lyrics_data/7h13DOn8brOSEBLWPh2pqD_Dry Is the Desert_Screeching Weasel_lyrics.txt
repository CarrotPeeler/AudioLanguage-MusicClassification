2 ContributorsDry Is The Desert Lyrics
Oh, how I miss you when I’m so far away
If you start to feel restless, just try to be patient
And whatever you do, know I’m waiting for you

Life can be hard, dear, life can be lonely
Times like these seem they’ll never end, but it’ll be over soon
And whatever you do, know I’m waiting for you

Blue is the ocean, dear
Green is the ivy
Red is the heart beating only for you
Dry is the desert, dear
Empty is the horizon
And I’m praying to God
That you’ll wait for me, too

I miss you so much when I’m so far away
Times like these seem they’ll never end, but it’ll be over soon
And whatever you do, know I’m waiting for you

You might also like
Now when you think of me
So many miles away
Remember my heart’s beating only for you
Dry is the desert, dear
And empty is the horizon
And I’m praying to God
That you’ll wait for me, too Embed
