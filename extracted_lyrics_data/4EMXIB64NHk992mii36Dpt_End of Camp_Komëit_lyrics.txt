2 ContributorsKeith the Moth LyricsHe may have only been a maggot
When he broke free from the egg
But he was young and strong and couldn't do wrong
And this is what his momma has to say
I want him to be known as Keith the Moth
Until the final day that is coming his way
So listen to me boy and you wonâ€™t go wrong
If you want to live another day
Make like Keith the Moth
Keith the Moth
Make like Keith the Moth
Keith the Moth
She had many fine tales to tell about all the fails
When you're living by the moth
If you fly to the sky where the light is so bright
You might get to see your wings drop off
Keith ignored his mother, just acted like the others
He was flapping his wings as if he was a king
And he flew to the sky where the light was so bright
Which saw the end of the life of Keith the Moth
Make like Keith the Moth
Keith the Moth
Make like Keith the Moth
Keith the Moth
You might also likePeople still come to the grave
That bears the name Keith the Moth
He was a legend in his day 'cause he showed the way
By flying to the ground in a clockwise spin
Aristocratic moths had shown the way
By flying to the grave another way
Then came along Keith the Moth
With his revolution way to end his days
Make like Keith the Moth
Keith the Moth
Make like Keith the Moth
Keith the Moth
(So anyway) So, anywayEmbed
