Buddy Guy
I got a heavy love, I can't carry it all by myself
I got a heavy love, I can't carry it all by myself
I got both sides of the wagon
Won't you give me a little help
I got a big fat heart, with lots of love on top
I got a big fat heart, with lots of love on top
You better come to my well darling
Before I have a love attack
I'd lay down my burden, if I only could
I'd lay down my burden, you know that I surely would
I got a heavy heart, I can't carry it all alone
You better come to my rescue darling, before all my strength is gone
Two tons of affection, three tons of desire
Will make this love connection set this weight on fire
I got a heavy love bearin' down on me
This love makes me a prisoner, only you can set me freeYou might also likeEmbed
