12 ContributorsIf You Leave Me Now Lyrics
Go
You won't go
If you leave me now, I can heal somehow
Back to a time when I knew myself
When I knew myself

Give me a reason why you choose to always hurt my soul
I gave you everything, oh baby, please, I have to know
Just answer me the question, are you gonna stay or go?
Stay or go?

Oh no, please don't go
If you leave me now
If you leave me now
But you stay
If you leave me now
If you leave me now
But you stay

Back to a time
But I know you won't
But I know you won't
You might also like
Give me a reason why you choose to always hurt my soul
I gave you everything, oh baby, please, I have to know
Just answer me the question, are you gonna stay or go?
Stay or go?

Oh no, please don't go
If you leave me now
If you leave me now
But you stay
If you leave me now
If you leave me now
But you stay

If you leave me now
Oh, just stay
If you leave me now
If you leave me now

Won't you stay?
Please don't go
If you leave me now
If you leave me now2Embed
