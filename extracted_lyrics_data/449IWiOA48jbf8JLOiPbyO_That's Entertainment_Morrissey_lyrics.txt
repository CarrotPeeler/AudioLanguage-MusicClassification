Police car with a screaming siren
Pneumatic drill on ripped-up concrete
Baby wails, a stray dog howling
Brakes screech as lamp light blinking

That's Entertainment
That's Entertainment

Smash of glass and a rumble of boots
Electric train and a ripped up phone booth
A hot day and a sticky black tarmac
A hot day and I'm wishing I was far away

(La, la, la
La, la, la)

Days of speed and a slow time Mondays
Wake up at 6 AM and think about your holidays
Open window and breathe in petrol
Cold flat with damp on the walls
Yes..

La, la, la
La, la, la
La, la, la)

Two lovers kissing over screams of midnight
Two lovers miss the tranquility of solitude
Read grafitti of slash-seat affairs
Splattered walls and a kick in the balls
Is all that you get, in the name of entertainment
(La, la, la)Embed
