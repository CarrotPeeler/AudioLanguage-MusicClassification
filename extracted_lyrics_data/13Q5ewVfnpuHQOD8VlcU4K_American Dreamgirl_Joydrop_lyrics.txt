1 ContributorAmerican Dreamgirl LyricsHey Mr. Music
With all your illusions
Your foregone conclusions
Your grand delusions
Hey Mr. Music
My name's not honey
And don't call me dear
My eyes are up here
I am not your American Dream, Your American Dream
I am not your American Dream, Your American Dream
Hey Mr. Music
The life of the party
Where everyone's pretty
And everyone's easy
I am not your American Dream, Your American Dream
I am not your American Dream, Your American Dreamgirl
Beautiful, Wasted
Surrounded by the world that made us
Plastic and wanted
Subscribing to your airbrushed magazines
Filled with American Dreamgirls
You might also likeI won't be silenced by your
By your small-minded validation
Your silicone creation
Rock 'n' Roll, masturbation
Beautiful, wasted
Surrounded by the world that made us
Plastic and wanted
Subscribing to your airbrushed magazines
Filled with American DreamgirlsEmbed
