6 ContributorsAlma Mater LyricsMother tongue speaks to me
In the strongest way I've ever seen
I know that she sees in me
Her proudest child, her purest breed
She speaks to me in colours
That I can't really understand
I only know that they are ours
And to those I'll proudly bend
For I am your holy child
And you're my dearest mystery
From an ancient throne I defy the world
To kneel before the powers within
For I her your only child
And she's my dearest mystery
World, can't you see it?
Am I alone in my belief?
Virando costas ao mundo
Orgulhosamente sós
Glória antiga, volta a nós
Alma mater
Breaking waves announce my dride
Is the only way the sea could sing
Legends of Lusitanian pride
He sings the words I cannot spring
At the moon mountain six wolves cry
Your lost glory we'll regain or die
You might also likeFor I am her only child
And she's my dearest mystery
Pagan gods in conspiracy
For the sword of tyranny
Mother tongue has spoke to thee
In the strongest way they've ever seen
World, can't you see?
I'm not alone in my belief
Virando costas ao mundo
Orgulhosamente sós
Glória antiga, volta a nós

To kneel before the powers within
For I am her only child
And she's my dearest tragedy
World, can't you see it?
I am not alone in my belief
Virando costas ao mundo

Glória antiga, volta a nós

Alma mater, alma mater
Alma mater, alma materEmbed
