1 ContributorEye Sockets Empty LyricsA persons character is in the eyes
The spirit of a living creature
In different colors so beautiful
A face that symbolize life
Two gaping black holes that shows the truth
To the inside of your soul
Black windows of death
A face that symbolize nothing
Collecting for many years
I don't need any tools
Progressive technique developed
Eye sockets empty
I have never killed a man
I just took their eyes away
Progressive technique developed
Eye sockets empty
Fixating the head with my legs
Firm grip around the neck
After moments of struggle, calm sattles
Globes right out from the skull
Collecting for many years
I don't need any tools
Progressive technique developed
Eye sockets empty
I have never killed a man
I just took their eyes away
Progressive technique developed
Eye sockets empty
