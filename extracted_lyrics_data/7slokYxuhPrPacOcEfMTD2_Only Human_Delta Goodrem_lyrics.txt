4 ContributorsOnly Human Lyrics
I've given my heart and can't get it back
I've had too many knives thrown at my back
Wouldn't it be easy to throw it all away?
Wouldn't it be easy to call it a day?

How do you love when you're broken?
I've had enough, I'm only human

I can't control what is out of my hands
But God knows sometimes I just don't understand
So wouldn't it be easy to just turn the page?
Wouldn't it be better to throw the book away?

How do you love when you're broken?
I've had enough, I'm only human

I'll see in time that there's a reason and a rhyme
It's just a season with some lessons for your life
But I want to know why today got so much colder
And I want to know when the storm clouds will be over

I want to love when I'm broken
I want to love I'm only human

When I see the sun I am starting again
No matter the luck, it's never the endEmbed
