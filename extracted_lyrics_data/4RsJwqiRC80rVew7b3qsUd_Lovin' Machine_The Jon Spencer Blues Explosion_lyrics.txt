Built a lovin' machine
I bow all night long
Built a lovin' machine
I bow all night long
I put the two dollar in
Three on fought frowned
Grab a hold of my drummer baby everybody watch out
Yeah! Amour amour
Whoo! get up Whoo! get up Whoo! get up Whoo! get up
Well I'm knocking down my door
Already broke the fax
I bring a ling ding ding
That's a telephone baby
US postman Federal express
Here come Western Union
Trying to beat the rest
I built a lovin' machine
I bow all night long
I built a lovin' machine
Yeah! Break down Like this
Oh brother man
I gotta get it Uh!
Oh brother
Get inside
Oh brother I gotta get it
Uh uh wow
Fell so good way down in my toes
Come on little baby gotta do it
Oh! Let's go
All around the world
Egypt and France
Brought her in the airplane
I gotta brand new dance
Built a lovin' machine
I bow all night long
Built a lovin' machine
I bow all night long
Yeah!You might also likeEmbed
