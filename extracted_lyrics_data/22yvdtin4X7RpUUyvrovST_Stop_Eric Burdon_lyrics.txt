Tell me all your troubles, tell me ev'rything;
I'll give you sympathy
You're not supposed to say no
But when you do
I can't control myself (control myself)
You're not supposed to refuse;
My love for you will make you satisfied sleep
Lord, Oh (come on, baby)(satisfied)
Stop feelin' sorry, don't you know
I'll give you anything you say
(What I say)
Look inside my lonely room and tell me
Do you really dig my lonely ways
You're not supposed....................
Dream on, dream on, dream on...........
Stop it, baby!
You're not supposed to say no but when you do
I get upset inside
You're not supposed to say no when do
I can't control (myself, myself, myself)
Hey! You better stop it, baby!
