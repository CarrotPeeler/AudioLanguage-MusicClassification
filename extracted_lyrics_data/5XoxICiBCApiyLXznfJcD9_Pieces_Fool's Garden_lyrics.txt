3 ContributorsPieces LyricsHello, who are you?
I never saw this girl before
I was astonished as can be
Somebody told me she said
You're just a hungry little guy
So I would like to offer me
To bake some cake for you
The sweetest one you've ever tried
A special cake for you
The one that makes you satisfied
Good-bye sadness
I'm dreamin' while you slip away
She took me by the hand
She really took me by surprise
One piece of cake was not enough
And so I helped myself
We danced in fool's paradise
And I got drunk of all the love
Then I realized she moved her velvet body over mine
I felt like melting ice
I just admit this woman was divine
Hey, hey, madness
I'm Dreamin' while you slip away
While Buddy the sweeper was singing a sad song
And Mary the singer swept the street
The honeymoon's floating over the river
Your cake is sweet
You might also likeI had a heartache
All the pain was over now
She said: "Bye, bye, little babe"
It was nice to meet you
She closed her eyes and disappeared
I hope some day we'll meet again
If apple or cherry-pie
You honey-bee I love the way you bake
Your cakes are wonderful
Don't care about my stomach-ache
Good-bye sadness
I'm dreamin' while you slip away
While Buddy the sweeper was singing a sad song
And Mary the singer swept the street
The honeymoon's floating over the river
Your cake is sweetEmbed
