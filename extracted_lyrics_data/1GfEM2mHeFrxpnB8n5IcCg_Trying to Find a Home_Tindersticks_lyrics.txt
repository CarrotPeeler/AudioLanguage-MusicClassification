7 ContributorsTrying to Find a Home LyricsStill trying to find a reason
Still trying to find a home
Just some place to spread my things in
A place from where I can run
Came from so far, so silent
You saw the stars above
Those smiling faces cheat us
Take what we never had
That low autumn sun brings another memory
I held up my hand so I couldn't see
Every colour you were wearing
Every colour in your eyes
Came from afar, so silent
You saw the stars above
Those smiling faces cheat us
Take what we never had
And I hear her whisper, "Where are you?"
And I see my hand upon her skin
She can feel me searching for her
Still trying to find a home
And there would come a time
When everything's so tough
And everything's apart
Trying to find a home
You're so near, and we're so apartSee Tindersticks LiveGet tickets as low as $55You might also likeEmbed
