1 ContributorHospitalized LyricsNo medication numbs amputation
When it divides your heart from mine, in cardiac arrest
Now we should be hospitalized
Wait for relief to arrive
Hospitalized
Wait for the pain to subside
Severed ties always ache and they mend slower than broken bones and bruises
When it comes to push and shove there's little room for love
Now we should be hospitalized
Wait for relief to arrive
Hospitalized
Wait for the pain to subsideYou might also likeEmbed
