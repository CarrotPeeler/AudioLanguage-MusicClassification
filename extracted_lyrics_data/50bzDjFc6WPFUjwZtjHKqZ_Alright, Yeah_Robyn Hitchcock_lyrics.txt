1 ContributorAlright, Yeah LyricsI gotta go
But it won't be so
I won't be back again
I gotta leave
But I don't believe
We won't be back again
No no no no
Everything's inside another
No no no no no, alright yeah
I gotta walk
But I'm gonna put my fork
Next to your spoon
I gotta split
It's a quaint
Old-fashioned way to leave the room, the room
Smell them burning leaves
Everyone beside another
No no no no no, alright yeah
Whatever you pray to
That's where you belong
I'm gonna get mine someday
I'm gonna get mine
I gotta laugh
But there's half
Of me that wants to sit and cry
I gotta split
It's a quaint
Old-fashioned way to say goodbye, goodbye
What's your mother for?
Not a launchpad for your father
No no no no no, alright yeah
Alright yeah
Alright...yeahYou might also likeEmbed
