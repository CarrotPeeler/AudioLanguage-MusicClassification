4 ContributorsWhat Do You Want the Girl to Do LyricsSo you think the girl is crazy
To eat up your lies like it's good
(Your lies like apple pie)
(She don't even cry)
She is not a fool
She's just tryin to do
What her heart says do
To love you
And as you take to the wind
(to the wind again she breaks down)
And as she breaks down within
(within within)
She waits for you patiently
Hoping that some day you'll see
All she really wants to be
Is yours and yours alone eternally
What do you want the girl to do
Don't you know you're breaking the child in two
What do you want the girl to do
All she really wants is you
She knows what you are
Still she'll be your queen if you'll let her
(Just say the word today)
Oh if you'll let her
(Build the world around her)
You might also likeNow and then you'll promise
All the way-out things you're going to get her
(You will see you will see)
Maybe she knows better
(So damn glad you found her found her)
As she watched you come and go
(All your show)
And as she watched your promises erode
She waits for your patiently
Hoping that some day you'll see
All she really wants to be is yours and yours alone
Eternally
What do you want the girl to do
Can't you see you're breaking the child in two
What do you want the girl to do
All she really wants is you
What do you want the girl to do
Don't you know you're breaking the child in two
What do you want the girl to do
Can't you see you're breakin' the child in twoEmbed
