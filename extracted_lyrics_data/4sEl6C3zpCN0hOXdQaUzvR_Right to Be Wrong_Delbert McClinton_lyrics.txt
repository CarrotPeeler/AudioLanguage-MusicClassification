2 ContributorsRight to Be Wrong LyricsWhen the words came tumbling out of my mouth
I felt it all goin' south
But I kept on talkin'
'Til you started walking
Now I'm trying to dig my way out
Ain't I got a right to be wrong
I can't believe you're so long gone
Why can't you just come on home
Ain't I got a right
Ain't I got a right to be wrong
You know I never meant to hurt you
I'm sorry for what I put you through
As much as I regret it
You won't let me forget it
Baby what you trying to do
Ain't I got the right to be wrong
I can't believe you're so long gone
Why can't you just leave it alone
Ain't I got a right
Ain't I got a right to be wrong
I meant what I said and I said what I meant
Never stopped to think about the consequence
I tried and I tried to apologize
But you just won't leave it alone
Ain't I got a right to be wrongYou might also likeEmbed
