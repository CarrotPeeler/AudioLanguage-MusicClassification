4 Contributors20 Seconds To Comply LyricsPlease put down your weapon; you have 20 seconds to comply
You now have 15 seconds to comply
You now have 5 seconds to comply
Four, three, two, one
I am now authorised to use physical force

The bomber awaits rises creates
An evil structure a terror conductor
A lethal weapon constructed by cretins
Crazy-minded man maniacal Satan
View to a kill blood must be spilled
Millions dyin' crushed and they're cryin'
Nuff o' da spyin' the plans are locked away
Return to base oh no no way
Pilots lovin' it the thought of droppin' it
Mass destruction at the push of a button
Think about the aftermath who gives a
Pilots don't too devoted to droppin' it
Megaton bomb no chance of rockin' it
Seclude the system death we give 'em
Hell returns 'em walkin' in limbo
Creatin' chaos the China Syndrome
Heaven's got no room ya wait in the middle
Sarcastic reaper skeleton speaker
Pure pandemonium

(I bet you think you're pretty smart, huh?)
(I bet you think you're pretty smart, huh?)
(Think you can outsmart a bullet?)
Mafia leaders underworld too
We gotta cane 'em these skankin' days are through
Torture in this day bring it back I say
So criminals crime are forced to low lay
This ain't a manuscript it's a scroll
Scroll to devise the claim of your soul
Inflict pain I inject like a viper
Mind for killing like a psychotic sniper
Lust for blood and a crave for ammo
Darkest of knights drowning in sorrow
This ain't a game it's the size of reality
Dyin' a death oh what a calamity
Insane maniac brain ready to blow
Where the sucker stood ain't nothin' but a hole
Jesus Christ nuff blood on the decks
And the posse in effect is vexed
Psycho runnin' round gunnin' everybody down
Sucker hidin' in the corner gotta be found
Sniffin' the c trackin' the h
Mo return select like a snake
REPEAT (You're gonna be a bad mother)
(Stay out of trouble)
(Y-y-you're gonna be a bad mother)
(Stay out of trouble)
First the guillotine and now the sequel
Twenty seconds was the deal
Have you complied with this new phenomenon
Or has the bullet done it again
My children beware
There's a bullet loose out there
(I bet you think you're pretty smart, huh?)
(I bet-I bet-I bet you think you're pretty smart, huh?)
(I bet you think you're pretty smart, huh?)
(Think you can outsmart a bullet?)
(Think-think-think you can outsmart a bullet?)
(Thank you for your co-operation)1Embed
