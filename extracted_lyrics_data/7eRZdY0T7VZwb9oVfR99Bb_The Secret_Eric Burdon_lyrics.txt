1 ContributorThe Secret LyricsI used to watch you Jules LeBlanc
When you thought no one was around
I watched you walk down to the bayou's edge
And gently lay your body down
Your secret was my secret
And it was all that I could do to keep it
Keep it to myself and the power that I felt
But somebody must have seen
And burned a sacred candle in my name
Because now there's a spell on me
And I'm caught up in your purgatory chain
They found a body just this morning
Out behind St. Genevieve
That's the sacred place I won't let them desecrate
The shrine you built for me
Because your secret is still my secret
And if it means I'll have to lose my life to keep it
I'll take it to my grave for the love we never made
Because somebody followed me and
Spoke a lover's curse into our flame
But now I can't runaway
Because I'm caught up in your purgatory chain
I'm on fire …
I'm moanin' mmm….Yeah

And it have to lose my life to keep it
I'll take it to my grave for the love we never made
But somebody must have seen
And burned a sacred candle in my name
Because now there's a spell on me
And I'm caught up in your purgatory chain
I'm your slave you've got me chained
No matter how far you go
No matter where you're headed
When you get there I will be there
Waiting waiting in the rain
Your secret is still my secret
And if it means I'll have to lose my life to keep it
I'll take it to my grave
For the love we never made
But somebody must have seen
And burned a sacred candle in my name
Because now there's a spell on me
And I'm caught up in your purgatory chain
I'm your slave
You've got me chainedEmbed
