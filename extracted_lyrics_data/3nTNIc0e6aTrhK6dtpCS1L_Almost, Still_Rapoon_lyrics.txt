1 ContributorYou Lyrics
You, you got me feeling this way
You got me feeling outta space
You put me back in my place, changed up all my ways Underserved grace
You, you got me feeling this way
You got me feeling outta space
You put me back in my place, changed up all my ways Underserved grace

I know this kinda late and I'm sorry
I gotta blue face like a Na'Vi
You can play this like Atari
But you'll never be able to stop me
It's god thing that I'm rapping still
Almost quit this thang was real
Feeling like MJ on the baseball field
Outta my comfort like I'm walking on stilts
I feel like god has plans for me
Cause he moved my fam out of state you see
High stakes, cause I feel depressed daily
But I'm struggling and praying God breaks me free
There's a break in me cause it's tough to be
A son of God in this industry
I'm this industry, I was meant to be
A white kid rapping bought the one true king
I ain't never been the hardest rapper
But I'm going harder than most of these rappers
Life's a journey I wish would move a little faster
But not too fast that I end up going backwards
Aye, lately my life has been crazy
I’m at the point of breaking like Mr. Swayze
I’ve been lazy, copy and pasting, couldn't find the right words Now I be praying
You might also like
You, you got me feeling this way
You got me feeling outta space
You put me back in my place, changed up all my ways Underserved grace
You, you got me feeling this way
You got me feeling outta space
You put me back in my place, changed up all my ways Underserved graceEmbed
