1 ContributorStoop Down #39 LyricsYou're my solid sender
You're a real mind bender
You're my lady lover
And I don't want another
You're a real sweet kisser
Honey, I can't resist ya
You're a real fast shaker
And you ain't no faker
Don't want no mambo
Don't want no jive
I'm riding the ropes
I'm taking a dive
You gotta stoop down, baby
You gotta stoop down, girl
Stoop down, baby
You gotta stoop down, girl
You got them switch off eyes
That got me hypnotized
You're a solid groover
An all night mover
You're the real tight grinder
Don't leave a thing behind ya
You're so sweet and tasty
Like the best French pastry
You might also likeYou got my t-t-t-t-tongue tied
Behind my back
You got the goods
And that's a fact
You gotta stoop down, baby
You gotta stoop down, girl
Stoop down, baby
You gotta stoop down, girl
Oh, crank it!
You're my tasty freeze, honey
You got me crawling on my knees
Oh, you're real fine stuff
And I can't get enough
Oh, baby
Ain't no stopping
Whoa
You got my eyeballs dropping
Gotta stoop down, baby
You gotta stoop down, girl
Stoop down, baby
You gotta stoop down, girl
Sounding good!
You gotta stoop down, baby
You gotta stoop down, girl
Let me hear you
Stoop down, baby
You gotta stoop down, girl
Oh, swing it!
I said stoop down, baby
You better stoop down, girl
(Stoop, stoop, stoop down, baby)
Stoop down, baby
Oh yeah
(Stoop, stoop, stoop down, baby)
Stoop down, baby
Treble, honey
(Stoop, stoop, stoop down, baby)
Stoop down, baby
(Stoop, stoop, stoop down, baby)
(Stoop, stoop, stoop down, baby)
(Stoop, stoop, stoop down, baby)
(Stoop, stoop, stoop down, baby)
(Stoop, stoop, stoop down, baby)
(Stoop, stoop, stoop down, baby)
(Stoop, stoop, stoop down, baby)
(Stoop, stoop, stoop down, baby)
(Stoop, stoop, stoop down, baby)Embed
