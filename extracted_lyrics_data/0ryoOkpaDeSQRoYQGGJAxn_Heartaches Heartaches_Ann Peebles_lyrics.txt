1 ContributorHeartaches, Heartaches LyricsI don’t smile anymore
I don’t even laugh
Got me doing funny things, baby
Some folks say you got me out to give me
(Heartaches, heartaches, heartaches)
Yeah, that’s what you do
That’s what you keep on doin’ to me
When I first met you
You didn’t have one cent
I got a job and worked real hard
Took all my money and I paid your rent, you give me
(Heartaches, heartaches, heartaches)
Yeah, yeah
That’s what you keep on doin’ to me
Yeah, yeah yeah
We go out
And make thе town
Everybody’s whispering
Calling me your pеrsonal clown
Oh but one of these days
You keep on doing to me
Got me so twisted and tangled
I can’t even, got to breathe
You might also likeOh, without you baby
I don’t know what I would do
I couldn’t stand it, baby
If you ever said we were through
Give me, yeah yeah
(Heartaches, heartaches, heartaches)
That’s what you keep on doin’ to me
Yeah, yeah yeah
Giving me heartaches
Every time I turn round
Got my mind twisted and tangled
Got my heart turned upside downEmbed
