M-m-mi-mi
T-t-ti-ti
K-k-ki-ki
Left at London what the fu-
Sk-sk-sk-Skrrt

Live your life, I won’t be living mine
Known it must’ve been the killing time
Hiding from it like a little kid
I don’t need myself I never did
Where did i go? Where did i go?
Where did i go? Where did i go?
Where did i go? Where did i go?
Where did i go? Where did you go?
Live your life, I won’t be living mine
Known it must’ve been the killing time
Hiding from it like a little kid
I don’t need myself I never did
Where did i go? Where did i go?
Where did i go? Where did i go?
Where did i go? Where did i go?
Where did i go? Where did you go?

Gotta get back in the pocket like a leather wallet
I had to dip out of my body invisible you never saw it
Aura glow neon, echo in the ether I'm a phenom
Shawty only hit me for Visa, I don't have to be there
KK Slidin with guitar I'm a Sweet Child
Seal with a Kiss from a Rose and the AK bling blaow
I don't wanna hear no notes no I don't want your feedback
Go ahead and peep the results yeah you gonna have to circle back
Go ahead refresh that mail on E
Where did I go, yeah you're never gonna see
I don't even know where I'm about to be
If you gotta know then you shouldn't have went to sleep
If I get my way I crash
Hope that this one ain't my last
Feelin my soul about to pass
Hope that my name forever last
Eyes, on my wave and my ways and my road, it's good
Til I go the wrong way misunderstood
I don't wanna have to take it all back but I could
I don't wanna have to take it all back but i could
Oo, hah, drunk but you mean well no?
Oo, hah, jumpin round can't stay put
Oo, hah, you don't wanna move stay froze
Oo, hah, live it out everyone knows
Live your life, I won’t be living mine
Known it must’ve been the killing time
Hiding from it like a little kid
I don’t need myself I never did
Where did i go? Where did i go?
Where did i go? Where did i go?
Where did i go? Where did i go?
Where did i go? Where did you go?
Live your life, I won’t be living mine
Known it must’ve been the killing time
Hiding from it like a little kid
I don’t need myself I never did
Where did i go? Where did i go?
Where did i go? Where did i go?
Where did i go? Where did i go?
Where did i go? Where did you go?

Live your live your life, I won’t be living mine
Known it must’ve been the killing time
Hiding from it like a little kid
I don’t need myself I never did
Where did i go? Where did i go?
Where did i go? Where did i go?
Where did i go? Where did i go?
Where did i go? Where did you go?
Live your life, I won’t be living mine
Known it must’ve been the killing time
Hiding from it like a little kid
I don’t need myself I never did
Where did i go? Where did i go?
Where did i go? Where did i go?
Where did i go? Where did i go?
Where did i go? Where did you go?Embed
