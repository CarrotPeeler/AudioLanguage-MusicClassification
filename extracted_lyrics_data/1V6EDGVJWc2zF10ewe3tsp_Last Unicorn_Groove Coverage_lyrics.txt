3 ContributorsLast Unicorn LyricsVerse 1
When the last eagle flies over the last crumbling mountain
And the last lion roars at the last dusty fountain
In the shadow of the forest, though she may be all and one

And you look to the north, and the pale moon is rising
And it seems like all is dying, and would leave the world to more
In the distance hear the laughter of the last UnicornYou might also likeEmbed
