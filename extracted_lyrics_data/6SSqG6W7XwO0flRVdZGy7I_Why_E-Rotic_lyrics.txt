2 ContributorsWhy Lyrics
Why, why don't you sleep with me tonight?
I need your body by my side
'Cause I'm so lonely, I could cry
Tell me why, why don't you sleep with me tonight?
You got my heart so occupied
And left me feeling hot and dry

I wanna sacrifice myself
I wanna be your slave
I wanna give myself to you

I won't let you down
But tonight I'm not in town
I can't, but can love you
But that's no reason to feel blue
I've got lots of doing
I can't sleep with you
Key to cool my love
'Cause baby sometimes left my stuff

Why, why don't you sleep with me tonight?
I need your body by my side
'Cause I'm so lonely, I could cry
Tell me why, why don't you sleep with me tonight?
You got my heart so occupied
And left me feeling hot and dry
You might also like
I wanna sacrifice myself
I wanna be your slave
I wanna give myself to you
Why, why don't you sleep with me tonight? (ooh, hoo)

Dance, may feel the sound
Even though I'm not around
I had, I had to go
So, please, don't say it's a different show
You and even true, but I can't sleep with you
And from six to twelve, just to do it by yourself

Why, why don't you sleep with me tonight?
I need your body by my side
'Cause I'm so lonely, I could cry
Tell me why, why don't you sleep with me tonight?
You got my heart so occupied
And left me feeling hot and dry

I wanna sacrifice myself
I wanna be your slave
I wanna give myself to you
Why, why don't you sleep with me tonight? (ooh, hoo)

Why, why don't you sleep with me tonight?
I need your body by my side
'Cause I'm so lonely, I could cry
Tell me why, why don't you sleep with me tonight?
You got my heart so occupied
And left me feeling hot and dry

Why, why don't you sleep with me tonight?
I need your body by my side
'Cause I'm so lonely, I could cry
Tell me why?Embed
