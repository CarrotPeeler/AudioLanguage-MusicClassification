3 ContributorsShe Lyrics
She is given such pain
She is faced with the evil strain
She is given no choice
She conquers and can't rejoice

I see the picture of her standing on the street
Her coat is white and her hair, black
I see the picture of her standing on the street
And she is beautiful

She has strength beyond compare
She gets past the loss of her hair
She is given no choice
She conquers and can't rejoice

I see the picture of her standing on the street
Her coat is white and her hair, black
I see the picture of her standing on the street
And she is beautiful

She is beautiful
She is beautifulYou might also likeEmbed
