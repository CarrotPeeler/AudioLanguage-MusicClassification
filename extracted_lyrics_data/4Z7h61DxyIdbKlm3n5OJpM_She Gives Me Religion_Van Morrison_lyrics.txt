3 ContributorsShe Gives Me Religion Lyrics
Down the mystic avenue
I walk again
Remembering the days gone by
And I'm knocking with my heart

And all the girls walk by
In all their summer fashion
And the church bells chime
On a summer Sunday afternoon

She gives me religion
She gives me religion

And the angel of imagination
Opened up my gate
She said, "Come right in
I saw you knocking with your heart"

And the angel of imagination
She lit your fiery vision bright
Let your flame burn into the night
I saw you knocking with your heart
You might also like
She gives me religion
She gives me religion
(It's alright)


All the girls walk by
In all their summer fashion
And the church bells chime
On a summer Sunday afternoon (It's alright)

She gives me religion
I said she gives me religion

And I'm knocking and I'm knocking with my heart
(She gives me religion)
And I'm knocking, knocking with my heart
(She gives me religion)
And I'm knocking with my heart
(She gives me religion)Embed
