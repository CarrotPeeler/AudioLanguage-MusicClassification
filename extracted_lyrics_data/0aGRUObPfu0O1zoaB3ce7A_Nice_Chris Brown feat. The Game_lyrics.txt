8 ContributorsNice Lyrics
Scott Storch, Game
Chris Brown

The meanest the meaner, the second I seen her
Had me open, got me looking, losing all my control
The passion I'm feining, baby, you're the new meaning
But I found myself tripping when you walked through the door
And I know it's not like me getting beside myself
She got me feeling that way
And I know it's unlikely that you're gon' deny me
And just walk away

I'll be that guy that don't have time to play
It's looking like a schedule is 'bout the same
The ball is in your court, I'm ready for your game
It's looking like your neck is ready for my chain
She be that girl I'll be waiting for
Sending me them signals that I can't ignore
Thought I was gonna get her on the dance floor
Then I saw her headed to the exit door

I call her nice 'cause she got it
Do whatever whenever 'cause she 'bout it
That there's nice 'cause I got it
Do whatever, whenever 'cause I'm 'bout it
I'm falling for her
She got me trapped
That girl's nice 'cause she got it
'Cause she got it, she got it
Breathe, breathe

Your body is screaming, believe that I'm listening
To every word you're saying, girl, I'm loosing my cool
You bet you a soldier and I got me a rider
And you ain't gotta stress it 'cause there's nothing to prove
I know it ain't easy being a sexy girl
That's always getting her way
But I'm here to tell you
You got me up on you and I won't let you slip away

I'll be that guy that don't have time to play (Nah)
It's looking like a schedule is 'bout the same (Yeah)
The ball is in your court, I'm ready for your game (Yeah)
It's looking like your neck is ready for my chain (Uh)

Breathe, breathe
Yeah, you ****** know now that it's 'bout go down
The club is packed up
The word around town that this is the jump off
You know when **** drops that this is the jump off
I did it for Big, Pac
I'm pourin' my Cristal, the ******* is too hot
They takin' they clothes off, they yellin' out, "2Pac"
'Cause I'm from the Westside and they from the East Coast
My ****** from down South, they lettin' they teeth show
'Cause this ain't Def Jam and this ain't Bad Boy
This ain't Star Trak, this is the last call
They turnin' the lights on, the bar is shot down
I'm walking with Scott Storch and we in the front now
The ******* is with me, they ready to pop off
You bringin' your girlfriend, she gotta get knocked off
So hop in the six-four 'cause this 'bout to get down
It's going down

I call her nice 'cause she got it (Oh, ayy)
Do whatever whenever 'cause she 'bout it (She 'bout it)
That there's nice 'cause I got it (C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon)
Do whatever, whenever 'cause I'm 'bout it (C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon)
I'm falling for her
She got me trapped
That girl's nice 'cause she got it (Yeah)
'Cause she got it, she got it (Uh, uh)
