2 ContributorsSea of Fertility Lyrics
When I was little
Found a different kind of me
I wish to bide my time in the sunlight
Revealing what I had been
Look into the ozone
No matter what I have seen
I would laugh and blankly go in
Where I want to be

Love, love, boundless in this love
You were my love oh oh oh oh oh oh
Restless every night
I could take time to find it
Time to feel it
Time to think at night
You were my love
Blossoming into the slowness of life

Now my body's lying naked by the sea
Look into the mirror and tell myself i'm free
Hold my cock in my right hand
Beclaim a newborn king
Masculine and empty
Annoying everything
The smell of cut grass is the strongest smell around
But the seeds are left and grass will come
Reclaiming fertile ground
An affirmation of this hopeless state you've found
Do you fear it like the blank
Let the medicine go down
You might also like
Love, love, boundless in this love
You were my love oh oh oh oh oh oh
Restless every night
I can take time to find it
Time to feel it
Time to think at night
You were my love
Blossoming into the slowness of light

Now my schooling tells me the way I live is right
I'm powerless and lonely
Afraid to walk outside
The act of living is a distant sounding voice
Like an echo of an echo
Merges weaken out of touchEmbed
