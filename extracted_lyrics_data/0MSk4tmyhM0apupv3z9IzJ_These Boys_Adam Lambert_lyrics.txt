Who you think you're calling stupid, stupid?
Well, you think you're big, you're tryna prove it?
Prove it
Ohhh, you think really such a slick rick runner
Keep on talking you'll be a goner, yeah

These boys, these boys can't slow me down
These boys, these boys can't slow me down
These boys, these boys, wanna have a go?
Who you calling clown?
These boys, these boys can't slow me down
These boys, these boys can't slow me down
These boys, these boys
Well, I'm getting close, so close
Well, I listen to the radio then I let it go
Listen to the radio then I let it go
Listen to the radio then I let it go
These boys, these boys can't slow me down
These boys, these boys can't slow me down

So you think you're quite a fighter? A fighter
But you're looking more like a crier, crier
Bet you think you really quite the stunner
But you're just like the rest, so go ahead and take a number
You might also like
These boys, these boys can't slow me down
These boys, these boys can't slow me down
These boys, these boys, wanna have a go?
Who you calling clown?
These boys, these boys can't slow me down
These boys, these boys can't slow me down
These boys, these boys
Well I'm getting close, so close
Well, I listen to the radio then I let it go
Listen to the radio then I let it go
Listen to the radio then I let it go
These boys, these boys can't slow me down
These boys, these boys can't slow me down

Slow me down
Slow me down (Ohh)
Slow me down
Slow me down (Ohh)
Slow me down

These boys can't slow me down
Take deep breaths
Try to take deep breaths
So I don't lose my composure
I see the edge
I can see the edge
When I feel I'm gettin closer, closer

These boys, these boys can't slow me down
These boys, these boys can't slow me down
These boys, these boys, wanna have a go?
Who you calling clown?

These boys, these boys can't slow me down
These boys, these boys
Well I'm getting close, so close
Well, I listen to the radio then I let it go
Listen to the radio then I let it go
Listen to the radio then I let it go
These boys, these boys can't slow me down
