1 ContributorSan Telmo LyricsYou make my blood pump faster
You make the rain fall harder
You make the room spin round
As I stand real still
We built our house on sand
You feed your baby water
And now my heart beats fast
So much for peacefulness
You want your wife to be a dancer
Now sit tight my man
And I'll dance right out the door
It might hurt just a little
Yet it's been done before
Let's make a long day over
We'll let the roof fall in
Is this how they live here in San Telmo?
Is this what they do for kicks?
I think I said 'te amo' before I knew your namе
And my winters' your summer and your summer's my wintеr
Let's make a long day over now that we're finally soberYou might also likeEmbed
