1 ContributorOff the Wall Lyrics
Here I am, everybody slides on through
Here I am, tryin’ to keep my cool
Look at the heavens, it’s not there
Not for me, not for me

It’s off the wall
Off the wall

Here I am, tryin’ to make, but it’s all in vain
Here I am, wish my mind was sane
Look at the heavens, it’s not there
Not for me, not for me

It’s off the wall
Off the wall

It’s off the wall
Off the wall
Look at the heavens
It’s off the wall
Off the wall
You might also like
Here I am, everybody slides on through
Here I am, tryin’ to keep my cool
Look at the heavens, it’s not there
Not for me, not for me

It’s off the wall
Off the wall

Come on, now
Come on, now
Come on, now!
It’s off the wall
Off the wall
Look at the heavens
It’s off the wall
Off the wall…Embed
