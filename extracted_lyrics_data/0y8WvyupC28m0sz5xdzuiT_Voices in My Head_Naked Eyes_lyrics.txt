I don't know why I'm feeling lost
It's only love
I give you everything I've got
It's not enough

Shutting my eyes I find
Opening up my mind
What is this sound I'm hearing?

Voices in my head
Telling me beware
I hear voices in my head
Everywhere

Whenever we're together
It breaks my heart
I've got a fantasy, of which
You are a part

Shutting my eyes I find
Opening up my mind
What is this sound I'm hearing?
You might also like
Voices in my head
Telling me beware
I hear voices in my head
Everywhere


Shutting my eyes I find
Opening up my mind
What is this sound I'm hearing?

Voices in my head
Telling me beware
I hear voices in my head
Everywhere

Voices in my head (Voices, voices)
Voices in my head (My head, my head)
Voices in my head (Voices, voices)
Voices in my head (My head, my head)
Voices in my head (Voices, voices)
Voices in my head (My head, my head)
Voices in my head (Voices, voices)
Voices in my head (My head, my head)
Voices in my head (Voices, voices)
Voices in my head (My head, my head)
Voices in my head (Voices, voices)
Voices in my head (My head, my head)
Voices in my head (Voices, voices)
Voices in my head (My head, my head)Embed
