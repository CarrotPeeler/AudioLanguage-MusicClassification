1 ContributorWhole Damn Thing LyricsWell I tried to do what's right
But the whole damn thing blown up on me
Yea I'll do it again to night
But the whole damn thing blown up on me
Yea I've seen this place before
Cause my hearts right on that floor
I caught a hurt right in that door
I've seen you walking out that door
Don't walk away, don't walk away
Well I tried to do what's right
But the whole damn thing blown up on me
Yea I'll do it again to night
But the whole damn thing blown up on me
Some throw away their money
Some throw away their lives
Some throw away their last chance
But I'm not letting go of mine
Cause I've seen this place before
I caught a hurt right in that door
I've seen you walking out that door
Don't walk away, don't walk away
Well I tried to do what's right
But the whole damn thing blown up on me
And I'll do it again to night
But the whole damn thing blown up on me
You might also likeWell I tried to do what's right
But the whole damn thing blown up on me
Yea I'll do it again to night
But the whole damn thing blown up on meEmbed
